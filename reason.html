<p>Chicago has slapped motorists with more than $100 million in vehicle impound fines since 2012 under a program that community activists and civil liberties groups say leaves poor defendants bereft of their cars and buried in debt.</p>

<p>Between 2012 and 2017, Chicago imposed $114 million in fines in more than 108,000 impound cases, according to records from Chicago's vehicle impound database obtained by Reason. Roughly $36 million of that money was collected based on drug violations.</p>

<p>In April, Reason published an investigation into Chicago's vehicle impound program, detailing how the uniquely punitive system is used to generate revenue for the cash-strapped city, often on the backs of people who can't afford it:</p>

<p>The city says it is simply enforcing nuisance laws and cracking down on scofflaws. But community activists and civil liberties groups say the laws are predatory, burying guilty and innocent owners alike in debt, regardless of their ability to pay or the effect losing a vehicle will have on their lives.</p>

<p>"There's plenty of reason to be concerned that there's injustice being done to people who are mostly poor, people who aren't in a position to fight back," says Ben Ruddell, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois. "The city has been perpetuating an exploitative system, charging exorbitant fees in a way that it knows is likely to make it so folks never get their cars out of impoundment."</p>

<p>The story highlighted the case of Spencer Byrd, a man from Harvey, Illinois, who had been fighting for nearly two years to get his Cadillac DeVille back after the Chicago Police Department impounded it. Byrd was a self-employed auto mechanic, and he said he was giving a client a ride home after a service call when the police pulled him over and discovered heroin in the passenger's pocket. Even after an Illinois judge ordered Byrd's car released to him while his state asset forfeiture case was pending, finding he faced substantial financial hardship, the city refused to give it up it until Byrd paid off fines and fees he owed the city.</p>

<p>Although Byrd won the state forfeiture case, a Chicago administrative judge ruled that he was still liable under the city's municipal code, which only requires a preponderance of evidence to establish guilt, does not give property owners a right to an attorney, and does not allow an "innocent owner" defense in impound cases. Even if a vehicle's owner is not aware of a violation, as when a teenager borrows his parents' car, the owner is still liable for thousands of dollars in fines and fees.</p>

<p>Byrd was fined $2,000, an amount he couldn't afford, since he relied on his car for work. His Cadillac remains in an impound lot to this day.</p>

<p>Byrd's case is not unusual. Defense attorneys told Reason it was common for clients in drug cases who managed to beat a state forfeiture case to suddenly find they were also facing a Chicago impound case.</p>

<p>Today's numbers provide additional details on how Chicago uses fines and fees. The most common reason for impounding a car was driving on a suspended license, which accounted for $47 million in fines. Unpaid parking and traffic tickets can lead to driver's license suspensions in Chicago. The debts can't be erased through bankruptcy, and even relinquishing one's car to the city will not count toward paying down fines and fees.</p>

<p>A ProPublica investigation earlier this year found the city raised $246 million in tickets in 2016, when it asked the state to suspend 21,000 licenses. A WBEZ/ProPublica story published Wednesday revealed 20,000 instances in which the city slapped motorists with multiple $200 tickets on the same day for having an expired vehicle sticker, which Chicago requires residents to buy annually.</p>

<p>There are dozens of impoundable offenses on the city's books. City records show Chicago fined motorists a total of $378,000 between 2012 and 2017 for playing music too loud. Other impoundable offenses include soliciting a prostitute ($831,800 in fines), possessing graffiti materials ($7,000), littering ($20,650), and illegal fireworks ($5,000). And in every one of those cases, the defendant lost his or her car, possibly for good.</p>

<p>Those fines do not include storage fees that accumulate after an impoundment, which often exceed the fine by the time a case is resolved. A case sheet provided by a defense attorney shows one defendant had racked up nearly $16,000 in storage fees on top of a $2,000 narcotics fine by the time his or her case was finally decided.</p>

<p>The records show the total amount of impound fines fell from a peak of $23 million in 2012 to a low of $16.6 million in 2016, followed by a slight uptick the following year.</p>

<h2 id="isitlegalforcopstoshootunlicenseddogs">Is It Legal for Cops to Shoot Unlicensed Dogs?</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-28</p>

<p>url: https://reason.com/archives/2018/06/28/is-it-legal-for-cops-to-shoot </p>

<p>Do unlicensed dogs have constitutional protections against being shot by police? It depends which federal judge in Michigan you ask.</p>

<p>A 2017 Reason investigation found narcotics raids in Detroit left a disturbing number of dead canines in their wake. Pets are considered property under the Fourth Amendment, shielding them from unlawful seizure by law enforcement. Although it takes a lot to prove a police shooting of a dog was unreasonable, cities have still paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars, more than $1 million in one instance, to settle such lawsuits.</p>

<p>In an effort to stymie those suits, lawyers representing Detroit have deployed a novel legal argument: If a dog is unlicensed, it counts as "contraband" under the Fourth Amendment, and its owner has no legitimate property interest in it.</p>

<p>In one case, Detroit compared Nikita Smith, whose three unlicensed dogs were shot by police during a marijuana raid, to a minor with an alcoholic beverage. The judge agreed. "When a person owns a dog that is unlicensed, in the eyes of the law it is no different than owning any other type of illegal property," U.S. District Judge George Caram Steeh ruled last year. (Smith is appealing that ruling.)</p>

<p>This year, a different federal judge came to the opposite conclusion. Nicole Motyka and her husband are suing the Detroit Police Department for shooting two of their pit bulls during a marijuana raid. Motyka's husband, a state-licensed medical marijuana caregiver, says the animals were behind a barrier in the kitchen when they were shot. Detroit argued that because one of the dogs was unlicensed, the couple had no standing to sue. But U.S District Judge Arthur Tarnow, in an opinion allowing the lawsuit to proceed, wrote that the city's argument was "misplaced."</p>

<p>Oral arguments in Smith's case were heard by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in April; a panel of federal judges will soon rule on whether an animal ceases to be protected from wanton state violence because of its legal status in the eyes of a city.</p>

<p>The answer may amount to little more than a footnote in the annals of Fourth Amendment case law, but it will be quite important to pet owners like Motyka and the dogs they love.</p>

<p>Prison Legal News</p>

<p>Reason</p>

<p>Uh oh—looks like you've landed behind bars. You should pick up a copy of Prison Legal News. This monthly magazine, the oldest continual publication written by and for inmates, is an indispensable resource on prison issues, prisoner rights, and the ins and outs of civil litigation in a system seemingly designed to keep prisoners from winning their freedom.</p>

<p>America's 2 million incarcerated people suffer inhumane conditions and civil liberties abuses that are mostly invisible to the rest of the country. Inmates have little recourse and even fewer sources of helpful, relevant information.</p>

<p>Of course, many prison administrators prefer that their inmates not be civil litigation experts. As a result, Prison Legal News is possibly the most frequently banned magazine in the United States. It has brought countless First Amendment challenges, filed public records lawsuits, and submitted friend of the court briefs against censorious prisons in 29 states to get its issues into inmates' hands.</p>

<p>Even for those not in the clink it's a magazine worth reading, if only to absorb the magnitude of the problem. A sample of headlines from the publication's April issue: "California: Mentally Ill Jail Prisoner Dies after Two Days in Restraint Chair; $5 Million Settlement," "Louisiana Prison Officials Sued for Trying to Block Investigation into Abuse of Disabled Prisoners," and "Florida KKK Guards Convicted in Plot to Kill Former Prisoner."</p>

<p>It's a hell of a system, and Prison Legal News is one of the few publications dedicated to documenting it.</p>

<p>The Gamecock</p>

<p>Reason</p>

<p>The Gamecock is not for casual cockers. Everything about the magazine suggests it's geared toward diehard participants of the now illicit sport of cockfighting.</p>

<p>The magazine's cover is decidedly understated, with most issues featuring only the title and the profile of a ring-ready rooster on a cream-colored background. Flip it open to find black-and-white photos alongside content geared not toward mass appeal but rather toward serving expert practitioners of this black art. That includes features about fighting birds, with descriptions listing the breed, price, and contact information for the seller. There are ads for performance-enhancing drugs guaranteed to improve fight performance by 10 percent as well as obits for dearly departed cockers (that is, the human owners, not the birds).</p>

<p>Sadly, The Gamecock is hard to come by these days. Lawsuits from animal rights groups got it pulled off Amazon, and in 2007 Congress passed a law prohibiting websites and magazines from advertising these fine fighting fowls, essentially killing The Gamecock's funding stream.</p>

<p>Looking at fragments of the magazine online can thus make one nostalgic for a time when watching two birds tear each other apart in the ring was a beloved pastime and not the subject of a puritanical prohibition.</p>

<p>Dwelling Portably</p>

<p>Reason</p>

<p>Since 1980, Bert and Holly Davis have been writing issues of Dwelling Portably from a yurt in an undisclosed location in Oregon. The 'zine offers a fascinating, idiosyncratic look into do-it-yourself homesteading and living off the grid.</p>

<p>Written on a manual typewriter in minuscule font (to save paper), the publication is jampacked with decades' worth of know-how and gives readers the skinny on everything from how to construct a solar water heater to the legality of dumpster diving. Want to build a $20 dugout shelter using no poles or supports? Bert and Holly have got you covered, literally.</p>

<p>If you're a DIY enthusiast, an aspiring urban nomad, or someone who daydreams about rejecting the trappings of modernity and just living, man, Dwelling Portably is your ticket to ride. Various online 'zine distros, such as Microcosm, carry collections of it. And if you can track down the current P.O. box the Davises are using, you can send them some crisp dollar bills in exchange for an issue.</p>

<p>Inspire</p>

<p>Reason</p>

<p>In the minds of many people, Al Qaeda is the embodiment of evil, and for good reason: The Islamic terrorist organization has killed a lot of innocent people.</p>

<p>Yet for such a homicidal bunch, the group's print magazine Inspire is chillingly normal. Its presentation is utterly indistinguishable from many mainstream publications found on ordinary newsstands in the West, down to the glossy pages and custom graphics. The same can be said of its format, which is a mix of features, interviews, handy how-tos, and advice columns.</p>

<p>Even much of the content wouldn't be out of place in some of America's more solidly left-wing magazines, provided the prose were tightened and scrubbed of its religious references. The Summer 2017 issue features articles criticizing capitalism for its heartless lack of concern for the poor and calling out the U.S. for hypocrisy when it comes to guaranteeing freedom for racial minorities. The latter is complete with a picture of the police killing Eric Garner. Inspire even shares a progressive enthusiasm for rail transit, referring to it as "the most modern and important means of transportation."</p>

<p>Of course, for all this uncomfortable normality, there is still plenty that is shockingly violent, including a step-by-step guide to derailing those "modern and important" trains and an editor's note explaining why violence against civilians is justifiable.</p>

<p>Aesthetic standards, it would appear, are more universal than moral ones.</p>

<p>Don Diva</p>

<p>Reason</p>

<p>Don Diva has been documenting gangster exploits in and out of prison since 1999. The quarterly magazine, beloved by inmates and loathed by jailers, isn't idly boasting when it refers to itself as "the original street bible."</p>

<p>"Don Diva is like the Wall Street Journal of gangsta lore," one inmate told the Huffington Post. "And being that they don't let [copies of the publication] in the pens, it's like reading a rare or lost book of the bible when someone manages to get one in."</p>

<p>Because of its sterling reputation among inmates, Don Diva regularly scoops more well-heeled publications and scores rare interviews, including one with former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, who is currently riding out a 28-year federal prison sentence for fraud and racketeering.</p>

<p>If you want the nitty gritty on who just got sentenced to hard time for hiring a hitman, thoughtful takes on the criminal justice system written from insider perspectives, or even a feature-length analysis of how "pharma bro" Martin Shkreli (who was convicted of securities fraud earlier this year) might fare behind bars, look no further than the original street bible.</p>

<h2 id="kimkardashianiscurrentlyournationsgreatesthopeforprisonreform">Kim Kardashian Is Currently Our Nation’s Greatest Hope for Prison Reform</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-30</p>

<p>SMG/ZUMA Press/Newscom</p>

<p>Vanity Fair reported this morning that reality TV superstar Kim Kardashian will meet with White House senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as President Trump himself, to push for prison reform today.</p>

<p>Specifically, Kardashian will be pushing for a presidential pardon for a 62-year-old woman convicted of nonviolent drug offenses:</p>

<p>Kardashian hopes to make a legal argument to President Trump for why he should pardon Alice Johnson, a 62-year-old great-grandmother serving a life sentence without parole for a first-time drug offense. More than 21 years after Johnson went to prison, Kardashian came across Johnson's story on Twitter earlier this year and reached out to Ivanka, who connected her to Kushner, according to the source. In an interview earlier this month, Kardashian said that, if given the opportunity, she would "explain to [Trump] that, just like everybody else, we can make choices in our lives that we're not proud of and that we don't think through all the way."</p>

<p>You can read more about Johnson's case in her bio page on CAN-DO Clemency, a group that advocates for clemency for non-violent drug offenders. As her page notes, Johnson's clemency request was denied by the Obama administration.</p>

<p>Yesterday Kardashian also tweeted out the story of Matthew Charles. Charles was released from federal prison after serving 21 years behind bars for a crack cocaine offense, but two years after he started putting his life back together a federal appeals court ruled he had been set free in error. He has since been returned to prison.</p>

<p>As Reason reported yesterday, Charles' story sparked outrage and widespread calls for Trump to commute his sentence.</p>

<p>While the Trump administration is staunchly opposed to sentencing reforms, it has supported more modest prison and reentry reforms. Earlier this month, the White House held a prison reform summit where Trump called on Congress to pass a pending prison reform bill and get it to his desk. He also spoke in his State of the Union speech earlier this year about the need to give former inmates better training and opportunities for a second chance at life.</p>

<p>Trump has proved receptive to other celebrity entreaties, such as one from Sylvester Stallone that resulted in Trump's recent posthumous pardon of boxer Jack Johnson. Listen, it's a not great state of affairs when you need a massive celebrity to get the attention of the president and fix gross injustices, but if Kim K. can get it done, more power to her.</p>

<p>The White House did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<h2 id="thismanwasreleasedfromprisonandrebuilthislifetwoyearslaterhegotsentbackbecauseofanerror">This Man Was Released From Prison and Rebuilt His Life; Two Years Later He Got Sent Back Because of an 'Error'</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-29</p>

<p>url: https://reason.com/blog/2018/05/29/this-man-was-released-from-prison-and-re </p>

<p>Facebook</p>

<p>They're all aghast at the case of Matthew Charles, a Tennessee man who was recently sent back to federal prison after two years of freedom when an appeals court ruled he had been released in error. Now criminal justice reformers and thousands of others are calling on President Donald Trump to commute Charles' sentence.</p>

<p>Charles was released early from federal prison in 2016, having served 21 years of a 35-year sentence for selling crack to a police informant. Federal prosecutors then appealed, arguing that, because Charles had been originally been classified as a "career offender," he was ineligible for the retroactive sentencing reductions put into place during the Obama presidency.</p>

<p>Despite a request from a federal judge asking prosecutors to drop their appeal, citing Charles' "undisputed rehabilitation," the U.S. Attorney's Office pressed on. A federal appeals court ruled that, by the letter of the law, Charles should never have been released from prison.</p>

<p>A widely-read story published Friday by Nashville Public Radio reported in stomach-wrenching detail Charles' last days of freedom, as family and friends said goodbye and Charles boxed up the small life he had managed to build on the outside. Earlier this month, he turned himself in to the U.S. Marshals and was sent back to a cage for another decade.</p>

<p>Charles was not a model citizen when he first arrived at prison. By his own account, he was right where he deserved to be. He had a serious criminal record including attempted murder and kidnapping. His crack cocaine sentence included an enhancement for illegally purchasing guns.</p>

<p>But as the article details, Charles found religion in prison, became a law clerk and GED instructor, helped illiterate inmates decipher court documents, and served 21 years of hard time without a single disciplinary infraction. After his release, he held down a steady job, volunteered every Saturday at a food pantry, reconnected with his family, and found a serious girlfriend.</p>

<p>Mark Holden, the general counsel of Koch Industries and a prominent criminal justice reform advocate, says Charles' case demonstrates the problem with mandatory minimum sentences.</p>

<p>"These one-size-fits-all approaches don't work in society, generally, and don't work in the criminal justice system, either," Holden says. "This case in so many ways sheds a light on it. You talk about a guy who did everything he was supposed to do while in prison, he turned his life around. Then he gets out, and he's been leading a great life and just doing all the things you want to see someone do, but now he's heading back to prison. It doesn't make any sense. By the letter of the law, they got it right, but it's completely unjust."</p>

<p>Charles' return to prison is so outrageously cruel and stupid that it has spurred condemnation across the political spectrum, from MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid to the conservative website The Federalist. Even Kim Kardashian tweeted about it.</p>

<p>Criminal justice reformers have been pushing the story to the White House in hopes of catching the attention of Jared Kushner, the adviser and Trump son-in-law who has made prison reform one of his top priorities.</p>

<p>A Change.org petition started by Families Against Mandatory Minimums is calling on Trump to commute Charles' sentence; it now has more than 10,000 signatures.</p>

<p>As it happens, Trump is holding a rally in Nashville tonight, and local supporters of Charles' are trying to catch Trump's attention.</p>

<p>"As President Trump visits Nashville this evening, I hope he will review the case of Nashville resident Matthew Charles who, after serving over 20 years in prison, was released," Republican state Sen. Steve Dickerson said in a statement today. "After living in Nashville as a model citizen, Mr. Charles is now being sent back to prison through no fault of his own. In no way is this justice, and I urge President Trump to commute Mr. Charles' sentence so he may continue to move forward with rebuilding his life."</p>

<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Charles is hardly the only prisoner who has been rehabilitated and is a good candidate for commutation. In fact, federal prosecutors argued that Charles' case wasn't unjust or unique enough to warrant relief, because there were roughly 5,000 other federal inmates whose status as "career offenders" had led to them being denied early release.</p>

<p>"Indeed, the only thing that appears to distinguish Mr. Charles from others who were found to be Career Offenders years ago and who now show evidence of rehabilitation is that the vast majority of these individuals are still incarcerated while Mr. Charles was released from prison and, thus, had the opportunity to interact with society outside of prison," U.S. Attorney Donald Cochran wrote.</p>

<p>He may not have been making the point he intended to.</p>

<h2 id="morethan7millionamericansmayhavesuspendedlicensesforunpaidticketsandcourtfines">More Than 7 Million Americans May Have Suspended Licenses for Unpaid Tickets and Court Fines</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-21</p>

<p>url: https://reason.com/blog/2018/05/21/more-than-7-million-americans-have-suspe </p>

<p>An estimated 7 million people—and mayber far —nationwide have had their drivers' licenses suspended for unpaid traffic tickets and court debts, The Washington Post reports.</p>

<p>Legislators passed license suspension laws to deter scofflaws. But civil liberties and anti-poverty groups argue that such laws instead trap poor residents in a spiral of debt, leaving them unable to drive to work to pay off their fines without a risk of racking up even more debt—or even jail time—for driving on a suspended license.</p>

<p>Forty-one states suspend licenses for unpaid traffic and court debts. The Post notes that its 7 million figure may be a significant undercount, since several states could not or would not release the information. Several states also did not track the reason for license suspensions.</p>

<p>As Reason reported in 2016, nearly 900,000 Virginia residents—roughly 11 percent of the state—had suspended licenses at any given time. The majority of those suspensions were for unpaid court debts. According to the Post's analysis, Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia alone account for 10 percent of the suspended licenses it found nationwide.</p>

<p>Robert Taylor, a 28-year-old Virginia resident whose license had been suspended, told Reason that he was buried under a small mountain of debt from repeated fines. He was unemployed and unable to find a new job because of his lack of mobility.</p>

<p>"It's kind of like my feet are cut off," Taylor said. "I can't get anywhere. I want a job. I'll see a job, and when I find one I'm qualified for—I know I could run that store so well—but I can't get to it. Public transportation just isn't there. The bus will bring you in, but it won't take you back out. The only way to do it is to hopefully know someone who will give you a ride. So many of my friends have gotten traffic tickets that they've moved closer to town."</p>

<p>A report released last year from the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia found there were 4.2 million suspended drivers' licenses for unpaid court fines in five states alone. Only four states, the report said, require courts to determine a person's ability to pay before assessing a fine.</p>

<p>The practice came under scrutiny following the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown. Subsequent media reports revealed that the town padded its budget through the heavy-handed enforcement of petty fines and fees.</p>

<p>In a "dear colleague" letter released in 2016, Vanita Gupta, the former head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, wrote that "state and local courts are encouraged to avoid suspending driver's licenses as a debt collection tool, reserving suspension for cases in which it would increase public safety."</p>

<p>Federal judges have not looked kindly on the practice as of late. In January, a federal judge in Michigan enjoined the practice when it's applied to the very poor, ruling that suspending licenses without ascertaining the debtors' ability to pay likely violates due process.</p>

<p>And last year, a federal judge in Tennessee reinstated the drivers' licenses of two residents in what may have been the first ruling of its kind. As Reason reported:</p>

<p>Those two Tennessee residents are Fred Robinson and Ashley Sprague. According to the lawsuit, Robinson, 32, suffers from serious medical conditions, cannot work, and barely subsists on Social Security payments. Sprague is a mother of five who makes under $3 an hour as a Waffle House server.</p>

<p>Both Robinson and Sprague accrued misdemeanor traffic fines of several hundred dollars, and when they failed to pay, their drivers' licenses were suspended. Both were also told, when they tried to make partial payments, that no such installment plans were allowed. In addition to their other fines, they must now pay another $200 fee to have their licenses reinstated.</p>

<p>"One needs only to observe the details of ordinary life to understand that an individual who cannot drive is at an extraordinary disadvantage in both earning and maintaining material resources," the judge wrote in her order. "Suspending a driver's license is therefore not merely out of proportion to the underlying purpose of ensuring payment, but affirmatively destructive of that end....Taking an individual's driver's license away to try to make her more likely to pay a fine is not using a shotgun to do the job of a rifle: it is using a shotgun to treat a broken arm. There is no rational basis for that."</p>

<p>A similar class action lawsuit challenged Virginia's license suspension practices in 2017, but it was dismissed on technical grounds.</p>

<p>In response to growing criticism, Virginia announced changes in 2017 that were intended to keep poor residents from having their driver's licenses suspended simply because of their inability to pay court fines. But a year later, nearly a million Virginians—one out of every six licensed drivers in the state—still had suspended licenses for unpaid court debts, according to the report by the Legal Aid Justice Center.</p>

<p>"It appears that these reforms have done little, if anything, to stem the breathtaking current of Virginians losing their licenses," the report concluded.</p>

<h2 id="apublicdefenderisshakinguptheraceforsandiegoda">A Public Defender Is Shaking Up the Race for San Diego D.A.</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-16</p>

<p>Courtesy of Genevieve Jones-Wright For District Attorney</p>

<p>San Diego voters will go the polls June 5 to elect a new district attorney, and they will have quite a choice.</p>

<p>The current interim D.A., Summer Stephan, was appointed by the county board of supervisors; she's the hand-picked successor of former D.A. Bonnie Dumanis. Running against her is Genevieve Jones-Wright, a public defender who proudly touts her outsider status and is backed by liberal funder George Soros.</p>

<p>Stephan is running on a platform touting her experience combating sex trafficking. She has said, among other things, that there's virtually no such thing as voluntary sex work. She also characterized Jones-Wright's opposition to FOSTA, a deeply flawed piece of anti-trafficking legislation that recently became law, as a radical position far to the left of the Democratic Party. (Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris—a former California Attorney General who co-sponsored SESTA, the Senate version of the law—endorsed Jones-Wright on Monday.) Jones-Wright, meanwhile, is aligned with criminal justice reformers not just on FOSTA but on asset forfeiture, cash bail, and other issues.</p>

<p>This is one of several hotly contested prosecutor elections this year—part of an ongoing national trend of reform-minded defense attorneys shaking up what used to be quiet races. In fact, there have only been three contested D.A. elections in San Diego over the past quarter century.</p>

<p>Reason spoke with Jones-Wright about how a public defender ends up running for D.A., how a prosecutor's office should measure success, and the reality of sex work. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p>

<p>REASON: You're a public defender running for district attorney. There's this perception that you either have a prosecutor's mindset or a defense attorney's mindset, and ne'er the twain shall meet. What do you think of that?</p>

<p>JONES-WRIGHT: My story is a little different. A lot of people think that way, although we do see some prosecutors going over to private practice and there's some people in my office who became prosecutors because they had their eye on a judgeship. As for me, I wanted to be a prosecutor after the O.J. Simpson case. It was only because of my experiences and where I grew up, where the interactions with the court and law enforcement and prosecutors weren't a positive thing, and through learning more about the justice system itself, that I decided that wasn't going to be for me, to be a deputy D.A. and a tool in the mass incarceration machine. But I started off believing I would be a prosecutor and even interviewed with prosecutorial agencies while at law school.</p>

<p>REASON: What about the O.J. case made you want to be a prosecutor?</p>

<p>JONES-WRIGHT: I felt like the prosecution flubbed the case. Even as a high schooler I knew the prosecution didn't do a great job, and I felt they were the very reason the family members were denied justice. I watched the case every single day in school—it was all the rage—and watching it I thought, "Wow, the victims did not get justice." It was a direct result of the prosecutors. In my own high school senior mind I said, "I'll show them how to do it."</p>

<p>The problem was there wasn't this holistic or comprehensive view of people who were justice-involved. I want to change the culture from where it's all about over-incarcerating people and not helping people. That's the mindset I want to bring: People are humans, not numbers or statistics. In a lot of D.A. offices the measure of success is the conviction rate. How many people have you put in jail and for how long? I want to change that to: How many people are we helping? How many people did we help put their lives back together? How many kids did we prevent from ever coming into the justice system?</p>

<p>Being a public defender, I have a balanced perspective because I do understand that it's humans who are affected by decisions and policies that come out of D.A. offices, and when someone is justice-involved, how that can affect generations to come. And so we talk about preventing crime, but we also have to talk about preventing harm. That's what I would bring to the D.A. office.</p>

<p>REASON: I've heard you say in debates something along the lines of "the person being prosecuted today was a victim yesterday." Could you explain what you mean by that?</p>

<p>JONES-WRIGHT: A lot of my clients—and I work on the adult side—they come in with their own personal histories, just like we all do. Most of my clients come in with a juvenile dependency record and/or a juvenile delinquency record. And when we have children who were in our justice system, we know that they've been failed by the system somewhere. The education system, the foster care system, their parents—someone along the way failed them.</p>

<p>I don't see those things as being isolated. A lot of my clients were abused by their parents physically and/or emotionally. The same people that the D.A. office says they were trying to protect before are the same people they're prosecuting now because the trauma wasn't addressed.</p>

<p>REASON: In the criminal justice system, prosecutors have incredible power in charging and every step up through sentencing. What are your plans to implement this holistic view, as you called it, to criminal justice?</p>

<p>JONES-WRIGHT: The first thing is integrity and not overcharging cases. I see that in cases where I really reinforce to the client that they would be better off going to trial rather than taking a plea. That's really hard.</p>

<p>The other part is we have a lot of diversion programs—behavioral health courts, veterans courts, drug courts—but you have to plead guilty in order to get opportunity to participate to these programs. I believe in true diversion, where you don't have to plead guilty to get a case dismissed. Right now, you have to plead guilty, and the D.A. office's stance is if you mess up along the way—and relapse is a part of recovery—that shows you're not serious about completing the program. Your opportunity for dismissal is wrapped in the D.A.'s perspective of how serious you are. So I want to take that out of the district attorney's hands and give people a broader opportunity, so that fewer people will suffer convictions as a result of drug treatment or mental health issues.</p>

<p>REASON: Former San Diego D.A. Bonnie Dumanis was very aggressive in pursuing some civil asset forfeiture cases. What's your stance on the practice?</p>

<p>JONES-WRIGHT: I do not believe we should be in the business of seizing people's assets and property pre-conviction, for sure. We saw a lot of that here in San Diego with Bonnie Dumanis, where charges weren't even levied and a family's life savings were taken.</p>

<p>[Reason wrote extensively about the case of James Slatic and his family, who had their bank accounts seized by the San Diego D.A. after a police raid on his medical marijuana business. Prosecutors waited 16 months, and two weeks after a judge ordered them to return Slatic's money, to file criminal charges against him.]</p>

<p>I am completely against that practice. Now we're seeing where Jeff Sessions is incentivizing local governments to join him in taking people's assets by sharing the profits with the federal government and giving cuts to local government. I'm completely against that as well.</p>

<p>REASON: Your opponent has made the main plank of her campaign about sex trafficking and sex victims. In a debate she said you have a radical position that's not supported by the Democratic Party, and she's also said there basically no such thing as voluntary sex work. Do you think you have a radical position?</p>

<p>JONES-WRIGHT: I don't think it's a radical position. If you look at the opponents of SESTA and FOSTA, these are people who have made it their business to be human rights advocates on behalf of sex workers and human trafficking victims. You have a stellar organization like the ACLU, and you have voluntary sex workers themselves saying this is a bad idea, not only because it puts them in a position where they're less safe but because we're taking away the platform where they communicate with each other.</p>

<p>The fact that she doesn't believe that there's such a thing as a voluntary sex worker means she doesn't live in reality. You have to question her knowledge base. She's completely ignoring and dismissing an entire population, and that's what makes it dangerous. It's not radical at all. It's a common-sense approach to a problem that we have, and human trafficking is a real problem.</p>

<p>They're casting such a wide net over human trafficking that they're pulling in things that are voluntary, consensual decisions between two adults, which then takes away from the resources for combatting true human traffickers. We're also making it so voluntary sex workers can't cooperate with law enforcement. There's a lot of risk and so much danger in her position because it's not rooted in common sense or what we know to be true.</p>

<p>REASON: How about cash bail? There's been a nationwide push to eliminate cash bail and move to things like pre-trial risk assessments and other tools. What do you think of that?</p>

<p>JONES-WRIGHT: I've been a bail ambassador for the ACLU since before I ever declared my candidacy. Bail reform is something that is absolutely necessary and something I'm very passionate about. I have a lot of clients who are coerced into taking plea deals because they can't afford bail. Having that carrot of going home versus sitting in jail and waiting for your day, you're gonna wanna go home. I see where bail affects decisions and results in charges that otherwise may not have been successful at trial, because people will plea to them simply to go home. Poor people are being punished for being poor. We have to take the focus off of the ability to pay bail and put it where it should be, which is public safety. In our current cash bail system, if you're dangerous but have the money, you can go home. That doesn't keep communities safe.</p>

<p>REASON: Your opponent has also referred to you as an "anti-D.A. D.A. candidate." What sort of relationship do you think you'll have with line prosecutors and police officers while also holding them accountable?</p>

<p>JONES-WRIGHT: Her position is not rooted in fact at all, and she knows this. This is just fear-mongering. You can't be a successful public defender for 12 years and not work with the D.A.s, not have that relationship of respect. There's a lot of support in that office for me. I work with police officers every single day. I just came from chairing my gang documentation committee. I work with lieutenants and sergeants. She knows that's not true. She sits on the commission with me and she knows the work I've done. Her bringing in this language seeks to take away from a platform that's resonating with community members. People want a justice system that's one justice system. Not based on where you live, not based on your income level, not based on your race, not based on your gender. We don't have that in San Diego.</p>

<p>If the notion of ending the school-to-prison pipeline, testing every single rape kit, putting an end to this cash bail system that doesn't keep us safe is anti-DA, then I don't know what she is. The point is I'm pro-justice, pro-accountability. I'm anti-corruption. I want to bring true justice to San Diego, and that's just the end of it.</p>

<p>Tom Pennington/MCT/Newscom</p>

<p>House lawmakers will soon unveil a prison reform bill that criminal justice advocates say will significantly expand federal inmates' opportunities to earn an early release from prison.</p>

<p>Reps. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) are expected to reintroduce the Prison Reform and Redemption Act as early as today, renaming it the FIRST STEP Act.</p>

<p>According to text of the bill obtained by Reason, the revised legislation would, among other things</p>

<pre><code>•   allow inmates to accrue up to 54 days of good time credit a year. The changes would apply retroactively, resulting in the release of approximately 4,000 federal inmates.

•   ban the shackling of pregnant inmates, including while giving birth and postpartum. It would also require Bureau of Prison facilities to provide female hygiene products free of charge and increase available phone and in-person visitations for new mothers.

•   require the Bureau of Prisons to place inmates in facilities within 500 driving miles of their families.

•   increase the use of compassionate release for terminally ill inmates, and require new reporting on how many applications for compassionate release are accepted or denied.
</code></pre>

<p>Jessica Jackson Sloan, national director of #cut50, an initiative to reduce the U.S. prison population, says the bills passage would be "a meaningful step forward, there's so many areas of the criminal justice system that need reform."</p>

<p>"It provides a good basis for us to bring some crucial reforms, lets 4,000 people out immediately, create a pathway for thousands more to serve less time inside of prison institutions, creates more rehabilitative programs, and hopefully provides momentum to move forward with sentencing reform in the future," Sloan says. "There's a lot of goodwill on both sides of the aisle for sentencing reform. It's critical that we achieve it and I'm looking forward to that being the next step."</p>

<p>The Trump White House has signalled that reforming the federal prison system, including reentry programs and job training for inmates, is a priority. Senior White House adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner has been meeting with criminal justice groups, law enforcement organizations, and members of Congress on the issue since last year.</p>

<p>But reforms to federal sentencing laws is practically off the table due to fierce resistance from Attorney General Jeff Sessions, which is why the White House threw cold water on a bipartisan sentencing reform bill in the Senate.</p>

<p>Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Dick Durbin (D-Il.), who have been working for several years to pass sentencing reform, have refused to back down. Politico reported last month that the two senators worked behind the scenes to delay a markup of the Prison Reform and Redemption Act scheduled in the House Judiciary Committee.</p>

<p>Many criminal justice advocacy groups, such as the ACLU and NAACP, have pulled their support for the bill in favor of sentencing reform.</p>

<p>Stuck between the two camps, conservative and more centrist criminal justice organizations have continued to support the prison reform bill, arguing it would be a step toward reducing the incarcerated population.</p>

<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<h2 id="tennesseeprosecutorssunkabilltoreformthestatespunitivedrugfreeschoolzonelaw">Tennessee Prosecutors Sunk a Bill to Reform the State's Punitive Drug-Free School Zone Law</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-01</p>

<p>url: https://reason.com/blog/2018/05/01/tennessee-prosecutors-sunk-a-bill-to-ref </p>

<p>Jim Weber/ZUMA Press/Newscom</p>

<p>A bipartisan bill to reform Tennessee's drug-free school zone laws died in the state legislature last week after local district attorneys turned against it. The DAs had previously been neutral, but they moved into opposition after funding for new paralegal positions in their offices was removed from the legislation.</p>

<p>A Reason investigation in December found that Tennessee's Drug-Free School Zone Act—which creates 1,000-foot drug-free zones radiating from schools, parks, libraries, and day cares—had covered large swaths of cities with enhanced sentencing areas. Thirty-eight percent of Memphis, for example, consists of drug-free zones. Those laws were rarely, if ever, used to prosecute sales of drugs to minors or on school grounds.</p>

<p>Instead, first-time offenders receive huge sentences—in one case, 15 years for an $80 bag of mushrooms—even if school isn't in session or if they just happened to be driving through a zone. The threat of an enhanced sentence gave prosecutors immense leverage to squeeze plea deals out of defendants. It also enticed police and confidential informants to set up drug deals inside the zones for the purpose of securing a drug-free zone charge.</p>

<p>There were also wide racial disparities in who received the enhanced sentences. Sixty-nine percent of inmates serving time for a drug-free school zone offenses were black, though blacks make up only 17 percent of the total Tennessee population.</p>

<p>Because of such concerns, a bill to shrink Tennessee's drug-free school zones from 1,000 feet to 500 feet was sailing through state legislature this year with bipartisan support. Both progressive groups and conservative groups, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, supported the legislation.</p>

<p>But last week, the Tennessee House finance committee voted 9–13 to reject the bill after the Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference announced its opposition.</p>

<p>The Nashville Scene reports that the group's sudden switch came after the bill's Senate co-sponsor stripped provisions that would have used the projected savings from the smaller zones to fund 18 new paralegal positions in D.A. offices:</p>

<p>"There was no active opposition going through [earlier committees]," Rep. Tilman Goins told the finance committee. "The opposition began when the amendment went on that removed positions from the district attorneys. So it's hard for me to pinpoint what the true issue may be."</p>

<p>In testimony before the committee that day, Steve Crump, the elected DA for the 10th Judicial District and the legislative chair for the state DAs conference, said the conference felt the paralegal positions would help prosecutors find new ways to address the opioid epidemic. On balance, he said, the conference saw that as a worthwhile trade-off and opted to remain neutral on the bill rather than outright oppose it, even though he claimed the conference had always opposed shrinking drug-free school zones. But now, with the new positions stripped out of the bill, he cast the legislation as a gift to drug dealers.</p>

<p>"You don't get a $3.7 million savings that involves the Tennessee Department of Correction unless a lot of people are in jail a lot less time," he told the committee. "People who sold drugs within school zones, as you currently made illegal and an enhanced punishment. You don't get a savings from the Tennessee Department of Corrections unless you put, in this case, drug dealers on the street early."</p>

<p>You can see Crump's whole testimony here. At one point, he concedes that almost all drug sales to minors are minor-to-minor transactions, not adult-to-minor. It was fear of the latter—of the dreaded playground pusher—that led Congress and all 50 states to pass drug-free school zone laws in the first place.</p>

<p>"The district attorneys' last-minute opposition to what was a modest, long overdue reform is baffling," says Daniel Landsman, deputy director of policy at Families Against Mandatory Minimums, an organization that supported the bill. "We know this law is not being used against the people it was designed for."</p>

<p>As the Scene lays out, other legislators, both Republicans and Democrats weren't buying the abrupt change of heart from the prosecutors' association, either.</p>

<p>"The timing's really bad," Republican Rep. Ryan Williams told Crump. "It kind of points in a different direction, that you're mainly frustrated that you lost the 18 positions, that you were for it before you were against it, and that kind of bothers me, really. Especially when you sit up here and say that this committee, if they vote for this, is soft on crime."</p>

<p>But in the end, state legislators, especially Republicans, don't want to be on the bad side of their local D.A. So Tennessee will keep a system in place that puts first-time drug offenders in prison for years, sometimes decades.</p>

<h2 id="jamescomeyhascraptacularopinionsonmassincarcerationandprosecutors">James Comey Has Craptacular Opinions on Mass Incarceration and Prosecutors</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-18</p>

<p>url: https://reason.com/blog/2018/04/18/james-comey-has-craptacular-opinions-on </p>

<p>A soon-to-be-disappointed customer // Justin Ng/Retna/Avalon.red/Newscom</p>

<p>Former FBI chief James Comey has been storming the airwaves this week to promote A Higher Loyalty, his very-sincere-and-definitely-not-an-attempt-to-burnish-his-reputation-and-cash-in-on-getting-fired-by-the-president memoir.</p>

<p>While much of the buzz around the book involves its comments on Donald Trump, Comey is a career lawman, which means A Higher Loyalty also filled with spicy takes on criminal justice, paeans to the rule of law, and sweaty odes to the great and powerful institutions that save us from anarchy.</p>

<p>Over on Twitter, freelance writer Patrick Blanchfield has been reading through Comey's new book and flagging particularly dumb passages about criminal justice. He's been busy.</p>

<p>For example, here is Comey recalling a meeting he had with Barack Obama, where he explained to the president that the term "mass incarceration" is really quite mean to police and prosecutors:</p>

<p>Although I agreed that the jailing of so many black men was a tragedy, I also shared how a term he used, "mass incarceration"—to describe what, in his view, was a national epidemic of locking up too many people—struck the ears of those of us who had dedicated much of our lives to trying to reduce crime in minority neighborhoods....I thought the term was both inaccurate and insulting to a lot of good people in law enforcement who cared deeply about helping people trapped in dangerous neighborhoods. It was inaccurate in the sense that there was nothing "mass" about the incarceration: every defendant was charged individually, represented individually by counsel, convicted by a court individually, reviewed on appeal individually, and incarcerated. That added up to a lot of people in jail, but there was nothing "mass" about it, I said. And the insulting part, I explained, was the way it cast as illegitimate the efforts by cops, agents, and prosecutors—joined by the black community—to rescue hard-hit neighborhoods.</p>

<p>"Mass incarceration" may be a slippery term, but it strains credulity to argue there's nothing "mass" about a 500 percent rise in the U.S. prison population over 40 years. This historically unprecedented warehousing of human beings wasn't an accident or something the country just stumbled into. It was a result of deliberate policies by state and federal officials, a shift to what Berkeley law professor Jonathan Simon calls "total incapacitation."</p>

<p>To put this in some perspective, California had 20,000 prisoners in 1977. By 2003, it had 160,000. Between 1980 and 2000, the Golden State built 20 new prisons to house inmates created by its punitive laws.</p>

<p>Here's what that rise looked like nationally:</p>

<p>The Sentencing Project</p>

<p>And while Comey is correct that defendants are sentenced individually, not collectively, there's nothing individual about the mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines that lawmakers passed to fill all those new prisons.</p>

<p>Such guidelines take away a judge's ability to weigh defendants' character, circumstances, and future prospects, essentially turning judges into little more than rubber stamps during sentencing hearings. Read Reason's investigation of Florida's mandatory minimum sentencing laws to see judges making comments to just that effect. ("Under this set of circumstances, this court does nothing more than perform an administerial function. I sign the papers. I'm on autopilot.") Mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines also transferred discretion from the judiciary to the prosecutors, who proved to be remarkably aggressive in pursuing criminal charges even as crime rates fell throughout the late '90s and early 2000s.</p>

<p>Claiming the term "mass incarceration" is insulting to law enforcement is an attempt to replace the real target of criminal justice reformers—the policies, institutions, and political imperatives that incentivize and protect bad policing and overzealous prosecutions—with the ostensibly well-meaning frontline of law enforcement, whose feelings must be preserved.</p>

<p>Oh, but Comey isn't done. He also has bad opinions on the rule of law.</p>

<p>Readers might remember that Martha Stewart was sentenced to five months in federal prison in 2004 as a result of an insider trading investigation. The businesswoman and homemaker extraordinaire wasn't actually convicted of securities fraud. The feds could only make the charges of conspiracy, obstruction, and false statements stick.</p>

<p>Because almost everyone intentionally or unintentionally tells falsehoods to the FBI, it's a common tactic for federal prosecutors to ring up defendants on a smorgasbord of charges, confident that they'll at least get a conviction for false statements. Think that's unjust? For Comey, it's nothing less than preserving the fabric of society like an Old Testament God:</p>

<p>The Stewart experience reminded me that the justice system is an honor system. We really can't always tell when people are lying or hiding documents, so when we are able to prove it, we simply must do so as a message to everyone.</p>

<p>There was once a time when most people worried about going to hell if they violated an oath taken in the name of God. That divine deterrence has slipped away from our modern cultures. In its place, people must fear going to jail. they must fear their lives being turned upside down. They must fear their pictures splashed on newspapers and websites. People must fear having their name forever associated with a criminal act if we are to have a nation with a rule of law. Martha Stewart lied, blatantly, in the justice system. To protect the institution of justice, and reinforce a culture of truth-telling, she had to be prosecuted. I am very confident that should the circumstance arise, Martha Stewart would not lie to federal investigators again.</p>

<p>It takes an incredible amount of self-regard to imagine one is doing the work of the Almighty in a fallen world. Luckily, James Comey is up to the job.</p>

<h2 id="policecanrefusetosaywhetherrecordsexistnewyorkshighestcourtrules">Police Can Refuse to Say Whether Records Exist, New York's Highest Court Rules</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-29</p>

<p>url: https://reason.com/blog/2018/03/29/new-york-high-court-rules-nypd-can-refus </p>

<p>Talib Abdur-Rashid (left) // Bryan Smith/ZUMAPRESS/Newscom</p>

<p>New York's highest court ruled today that the NYPD can refuse to confirm or deny the existence of public records, a decision that transparency and press freedom groups called a blow to open government.</p>

<p>In a lawsuit brought by two Muslim men seeking NYPD surveillance records on themselves under New York's Freedom of Information Law (FOIL), the state Court of Appeals said the department can invoke the so-called "Glomar response" made famous by the CIA—that is, it can refuse to say whether or not the records exist. Chief Judge Janet DiFiore, in a majority opinion joined by three of her colleagues, accepted the NYPD's argument that disclosing whether or not such records exist would compromise its counterterrorism operations. FOIL, DiFiore writes, "was never designed to compel a law enforcement agency to disclose inherently confidential, investigatory information of this nature."</p>

<p>Media outlets, press freedom organizations, and civil liberties groups say the ruling is a another example of federal secrecy doctrine trickling down to state and local agencies. "This ruling opens the door to the NYPD and other police agencies vastly expanding the secrecy that already conceals too much of what they do," Chris Dunn, associate legal director at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement to Reason. "But the ruling also makes clear that this should be a narrow exception, and we intend to fight to make sure it remains a narrow exception."</p>

<p>The case started in 2012, when Samir Hashmi and Talib Abdur-Rashid—a Pakistani business student and an imam at a Harlem mosque, respectively—filed FOIL requests seeking any NYPD surveillance records on themselves. A 2011 Associated Press investigation had revealed that the NYPD's Demographics Unit, with help from the CIA, was using undercover officers and paid informants to extensively surveil Muslim communities, not just in New York City but also in New Jersey and other places far outside its jurisdiction. Hashmi and Abdur-Rashid strongly suspected they had been surveilled.</p>

<p>Hashmi had been involved in the Muslim Student Association at Rutgers University, one of several Muslim student groups the NYPD had monitored, while Abdur-Rashid was a politically active black Muslim. Among the documents obtained by the A.P. was an NYPD Demographics Unit list of "ancestries of interest," which included "American Black Muslim."</p>

<p>After stonewalling their requests for more than a year, the NYPD finally issued a response saying it would neither confirm or deny that such records existed. The Glomar doctrine—named after a 1975 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit seeking records about the Glomar Explorer, a salvage ship the CIA used in an attempt to recover a sunken Soviet submarine—is well-established at the federal level, but it is virtually nonexistent at the state level. As far as public records experts could tell, the NYPD's response was the first time any state or local agency in the country had tried to invoke Glomar powers. New York's open government statutes don't grant any such escape hatch for public agencies, and Hashmi and Abdur-Rashid's case was the first time New York courts had considered the question.</p>

<p>Although the majority of the appeals court sided with the police department, Judge Leslie Stein noted in a dissenting opinion that the court had not even reviewed the records at issue to determine if the NYPD was frivolously using terrorism as an excuse to deny Hashmi and Abdur-Rashid's requests. "Rather, the majority accepts, without any scrutiny, the NYPD's claim that the scope of the relevant 'investigation' is 'terrorism', and that revelation of any investigation—apparently of any person for any reason—could impede its counterterrorism efforts," Stein writes. "Viewed in this light, it follows that the NYPD could claim the right to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of any record that even tangentially relates to any past, present, or future investigation of 'crime,' thereby avoiding its FOIL obligations in innumerable cases."</p>

<p>For Hashmi and Abdur Rashid, their case was less about abstract transparency concerns than about their own dignity as American citizens. "I wanted to see exactly what [the NYPD] had, what they were alleging and investigating," Abdur-Rashid told me in 2016. "We live in America, man. And dissent against social injustice is not a crime or a justification for being investigated."</p>

<h2 id="mississippisheriffsdepartmentgetssuedaclufindsalongwhiteprideemail">Mississippi Sheriff's Department Gets Sued, ACLU Finds a Long 'White Pride' Email</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-14</p>

<p>url: https://reason.com/blog/2018/03/14/white-pride-email-circulated-among-missi </p>

<p>In the same Mississippi county that's currently being sued for running discriminatory, unconstitutional roadblocks in black neighborhoods, the now-sheriff forwarded a chain message about "white pride" containing a long list of racial slurs around the office.</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Mississippi revealed the 2009 email, subject line "'White' Pride," in a tranche of exhibits that it says show a culture of casual discrimination and lax discipline. Current Madison County Sheriff Randy Tucker, who was elected in 2012, forwarded it to several of his Madison County colleagues.</p>

<p>The message is a sloppy chain message containing many common tropes among aggrieved white people, such as "How come there's no White History Month?"</p>

<p>Here's some of the lowlights:</p>

<p>Exhibit from Brown v. Madison County</p>

<p>Court filing in Brown v. Madison County</p>

<p>Last year, the ACLU and the law firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett filed a class-action civil rights lawsuit against Madison County, alleging it has subjected its residents to more than a decade of brazenly illegal and discriminatory policing—warrantless home invasions, unconstitutional roadblocks that appear only in black neighborhoods, and aggressive "jump out" squads that target young black men doing nothing more than walking down the street.</p>

<p>At the roadblocks, deputies run licenses for outstanding warrants and court fines as well as look for probable cause to perform searches. They also in some cases stop pedestrians. The ACLU argues that setting up roadblocks for general crime control purposes violates the Fourth Amendment on its face, even without the added discriminatory element.</p>

<p>As Reason detailed in an investigation last year, black residents of Madison County, just north of the state capital of Jackson, have felt under siege from the local sheriff's department for generations, but they have been almost totally ignored by the county government.</p>

<p>"We've all had problems dealing with Madison County," Quinnetta Thomas, the wife of one of the suit's plaintiffs, told Reason. "My situation is one of the prime examples of how Madison County works. They stormed in and made us feel unsafe in our own home."</p>

<p>Thomas captured video of a Madison County sheriff's deputy with his hand around the neck of her husband, whose hands were handcuffed behind his back. According to Manning and Thomas, deputies barged into their home at 7 in the morning and demanded they sign a false witness statement about a nearby robbery.</p>

<p>In a press conference today, the ACLU of Mississippi and Simpson Thacher presented new statistical evidence showing black residents make up the bulk of arrests and citations issued by the Madison County Sheriff's Department.</p>

<p>Despite making up 38 percent of the population of the county, black residents accounted for 77 percent of all arrests, 76 percent of all arrests at roadblocks, and 72 percent of all citations.</p>

<p>The ACLU also says data turned over by the sheriff's department reveals that, on average, the per capita rate of police roadblocks in predominantly black census tracts in Madison County is double the rate in predominantly white census tracts.</p>

<p>"That data has been statistically studied and controlled for other factors, and we think it's overwhelming," Jonathan Youngwood, a lawyer at Simpson Thacher, said at the press conference.</p>

<p>In testimony from depositions in the case, several former sheriff's department employees said that they heard deputies using racial slurs and that the deputies in question were never disciplined.</p>

<p>One of the other documents turned over to the ACLU and Simpson Thacher is the template case sheet for the department's narcotics unit. All of the fields on the form are blank, except three that are automatically filled in: "black," "male," and "arrested."</p>

<p>"There is a toxic culture that allows for a suspect-first, citizen-second mentality among many deputies," Blackmon said at the press conference.</p>

<p>Sheriff Tucker told The Clarion-Ledger last May that his department intends to "vigorously fight" the lawsuit. "Our deputies are professional law enforcement officials who enforce Mississippi laws," he told the paper.

<h2 id="floridamaybeabouttolaunchthemostambitiouscriminaljusticetransparencyprojectintheus">Florida May Be About to Launch the Most Ambitious Criminal Justice Transparency Project in the U.S.</h2>

<p>Gary Coronado/ZUMA Press/Newscom</p>

<p>Last Friday, the Florida legislature passed a first-of-its kind bill to collect an unprecedented amount of data on its criminal justice system.</p>

<p>If Florida Gov. Rick Scott signs the bill into law, the state will begin collecting detailed criminal justice records from all 67 counties in the state starting in 2019, which will then be published online in one central location.</p>

<p>Amy Bach, the executive director of Measures for Justice, a group that collects and analyzes criminal justice data from counties around the country, says this sort of centralized data collection has never been tried at the state level.</p>

<p>"This may seem like a great, obvious idea, but no one else has done this," Bach says "It really puts Florida as the national leader."</p>

<p>One of the most vexing problems for researchers, policy-makers, and journalists is that the data surrounding the criminal justice system is a mess. There are 3,144 counties in the U.S., each with their own criminal justice system. There are no uniform standards for what records they collect or common definitions of terms across those counties.</p>

<p>In an interview with Reason before the bill passed, Florida Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes said the aim of the legislation was to create "the gold standard for data in the country."</p>

<p>"We don't even have a common definition for recidivism in the state," Brandes told Reason earlier this month, lamenting the current system. "We have a law that says you have to serve 85 percent of your sentence, but if you ask the prosecutors, the Department of Corrections and the governor's office what 85 percent means, you get three different answers."</p>

<p>California has a criminal justice data portal, and in Illinois, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx releases annual reports and raw data on prosecutions, a fairly groundbreaking move for a prosecutor's office. But those efforts are exceptions to the general rule of confusion and disorder when it comes to criminal justice records.</p>

<p>Previously, news outlets like The Herald-Tribune had to trawl through numerous databases and dusty boxes of court records to piece together an investigation into racial disparities in the state's criminal justice system. Florida's data collection efforts would be a godsend to journalists and groups like Measures for Justice.</p>

<p>"This means you're going to get pre-trial release decisions on who is being assigned bail," Bach says, "data on indigence, so you can see if poor people are having different procedural outcomes; data on ethnicity, so the first time you can see how Latinos, who are the largest ethnic group in Florida, are being treated; and data on what type of offenders are being convicted for new offenses or being released, which helps us look at recidivism."</p>

<p>The bill will also require counties to collect plea bargain agreements between prosecutors and defendants. Despite more than 95 percent of all criminal prosecutions ending in plea deals at both the state and federal level, those agreements are so secretive that they are almost impossible to study in any comprehensive way.</p>

<p>The data collection bill was part of a larger group of criminal justice bills that included things like reforming Florida's mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines and raising the felony theft threshold. Those bills all died in the legislature, but data bill passed by a wide margin—part of a bipartisan acknowledgement that the state needs to get a better handle on its criminal justice system.</p>

<p>After decades of enforcing harsh sentencing policies, Florida has roughly 96,000 inmates, the third-highest prison population in the U.S. As a result of those long mandatory minimum sentences, about a third of Florida inmates are elderly and only getting older, creating ballooning healthcare costs. Overall, Florida is spending $2.5 billion a year on its prison system.</p>

<h2 id="mississippisheriffsdepartmentgetssuedaclufindsalongwhiteprideemail-1">Mississippi Sheriff's Department Gets Sued, ACLU Finds a Long 'White Pride' Email</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-14</p>

<p>url: http://reason.com/blog/2018/03/14/white-pride-email-circulated-among-missi </p>

<p>In the same Mississippi county that's currently being sued for running discriminatory, unconstitutional roadblocks in black neighborhoods, the now-sheriff forwarded a chain message about "white pride" containing a long list of racial slurs around the office.</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Mississippi revealed the 2009 email, subject line "'White' Pride," in a tranche of exhibits that it says show a culture of casual discrimination and lax discipline. Current Madison County Sheriff Randy Tucker, who was elected in 2012, forwarded it to several of his Madison County colleagues.</p>

<p>The message is a sloppy chain message containing many common tropes among aggrieved white people, such as "How come there's no White History Month?"</p>

<p>Here's some of the lowlights:</p>

<p>Exhibit from Brown v. Madison County</p>

<p>Court filing in Brown v. Madison County</p>

<p>Last year, the ACLU and the law firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett filed a class-action civil rights lawsuit against Madison County, alleging it has subjected its residents to more than a decade of brazenly illegal and discriminatory policing—warrantless home invasions, unconstitutional roadblocks that appear only in black neighborhoods, and aggressive "jump out" squads that target young black men doing nothing more than walking down the street.</p>

<p>At the roadblocks, deputies run licenses for outstanding warrants and court fines as well as look for probable cause to perform searches. They also in some cases stop pedestrians. The ACLU argues that setting up roadblocks for general crime control purposes violates the Fourth Amendment on its face, even without the added discriminatory element.</p>

<p>As Reason detailed in an investigation last year, black residents of Madison County, just north of the state capital of Jackson, have felt under siege from the local sheriff's department for generations, but they have been almost totally ignored by the county government.</p>

<p>"We've all had problems dealing with Madison County," Quinnetta Thomas, the wife of one of the suit's plaintiffs, told Reason. "My situation is one of the prime examples of how Madison County works. They stormed in and made us feel unsafe in our own home."</p>

<p>Thomas captured video of a Madison County sheriff's deputy with his hand around the neck of her husband, whose hands were handcuffed behind his back. According to Manning and Thomas, deputies barged into their home at 7 in the morning and demanded they sign a false witness statement about a nearby robbery.</p>

<p>In a press conference today, the ACLU of Mississippi and Simpson Thacher presented new statistical evidence showing black residents make up the bulk of arrests and citations issued by the Madison County Sheriff's Department.</p>

<p>Despite making up 38 percent of the population of the county, black residents accounted for 77 percent of all arrests, 76 percent of all arrests at roadblocks, and 72 percent of all citations.</p>

<p>The ACLU also says data turned over by the sheriff's department reveals that, on average, the per capita rate of police roadblocks in predominantly black census tracts in Madison County is double the rate in predominantly white census tracts.</p>

<p>"That data has been statistically studied and controlled for other factors, and we think it's overwhelming," Jonathan Youngwood, a lawyer at Simpson Thacher, said at the press conference.</p>

<p>In testimony from depositions in the case, several former sheriff's department employees said that they heard deputies using racial slurs and that the deputies in question were never disciplined.</p>

<p>One of the other documents turned over to the ACLU and Simpson Thacher is the template case sheet for the department's narcotics unit. All of the fields on the form are blank, except three that are automatically filled in: "black," "male," and "arrested."</p>

<p>Another one of the plaintiffs in the case, Lawrence Blackmon, says that when he asked the deputies at his door to show him a warrant, he was handcuffed and held at gunpoint in his apartment. They then allegedly searched his apartment from top to bottom, never producing a warrant.</p>

<p>"There is a toxic culture that allows for a suspect-first, citizen-second mentality among many deputies," Blackmon said at the press conference.</p>

<p>Sheriff Tucker told The Clarion-Ledger last May that his department intends to "vigorously fight" the lawsuit. "Our deputies are professional law enforcement officials who enforce Mississippi laws," he told the paper. "If a law is broken, appropriate action is taken regardless of the race of the one breaking said law. As always, we have fairly and diligently executed the duties for which we are required."</p>

<h2 id="aclusaysnebraskamayhaveillegallyimportedexecutiondrugs">ACLU Says Nebraska May Have Illegally Imported Execution Drugs</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts // CHINE NOUVELLE/SIPA/Newscom</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) today accused the Nebraska state prison system of violating federal drug laws to obtain lethal injection drugs to use in upcoming executions.</p>

<p>The Nebraska branch of the ACLU says the Nebraska State Penitentiary may have illegally imported and stored fentanyl that it intends to use to execute two inmates. In a letter to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), released today, the group asks the agency to investigate the alleged misdeeds—and to immediately suspend the DEA registrations allowing Nebraska to carry out the executions.</p>

<p>The letter says the penitentiary may have repeatedly misled federal authorities by importing and storing fentanyl under DEA registrations issued to an inmate clinic located at the same prison as the state's death row. The registrations allow medical practitioners at the clinic to administer controlled substances to inmates.</p>

<p>"Prisoners who are to be executed by lethal injection are not being diagnosed or treated, nor are they being provided any other form of medical care," ACLU of Nebraska Legal Director Amy Miller wrote in the letter.</p>

<p>The civil rights group also argues that Nebraska may have violated federal law by importing fentanyl from overseas without a proper DEA license. Fentanyl is a Schedule 2 narcotic under the Controlled Substances Act, and the penitentiary's license only allows it to import Schedule 3 and 4 drugs, the ACLU says.</p>

<p>Nebraska is attempting to resume capital punishment in the state after a 21-year hiatus, but it has struggled to obtain execution drugs, a problem facing almost every state that still practices the death penalty.</p>

<p>Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts told reporters at a press conference this morning that the ACLU "is fabricating charges in a desperate attempt to foil the will of the people of Nebraska." A Nebraska Department of Corrections spokesperson claimed to the Omaha World-Herald that the department legally obtained the drugs and that the ACLU's letter "contains inflammatory language clearly intended to discredit the department."</p>

<p>With the state facing scrutiny from media and advocacy organizations, the state government began an aggressive campaign to keep details about its death penalty protocols secret. In January the legislature passed new laws tightening what information could be released.</p>

<p>The World-Herald and several other media organizations are currently suing the state for refusing to disclose the source of its execution drugs, information that it used to provide to news outlets.</p>

<p>If the allegations made by the ACLU are true, it would not be the first time that Nebraska has skirted the law while trying to get execution drugs.</p>

<p>A 2015 BuzzFeed investigation revealed that Nebraska, along with at least three other states, paid Harris Pharma, a mysterious company in India run by a man with no pharmaceutical background, to ship sodium thiopental to them, despite a Food and Drug Administration ban on importing the drug.</p>

<p>Nebraska ordered $54,000 worth of the stuff from Harris—enough to perform 300 executions—but the feds intercepted the shipment, leaving Nebraska taxpayers on the hook for the bill.</p>

<p>The DEA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<h2 id="trumpnominatesmanwhocalledforabolishingussentencingcommissiontoussentencingcommission">Trump Nominates Man Who Called for Abolishing U.S. Sentencing Commission to U.S. Sentencing Commission</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-01</p>

<p>url: https://reason.com/blog/2018/03/01/trump-nominates-man-who-called-for-aboli </p>

<p>President Donald Trump has nominated former prosecutor and current Georgetown Law adjunct professor William Otis to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a body that Otis once said should be abolished.</p>

<p>Otis is a notorious opponent of attempts to roll back mandatory minimum sentences and mass incarceration. He's a familiar face to anyone who's followed debate on the issue, mostly because he's often the only person news outlets and conference organizers can still find who's willing to speak out bluntly in support of mandatory minimums.</p>

<p>"Two facts about crime and sentencing dwarf everything else we've learned for the last 50 years," Otis said at a 2014 Federalist Society gathering. "When we have more prison, we have less crime. And when we have less prison, we have more crime."</p>

<p>Otis' appointment to the U.S. Sentencing Commission—a bipartisan, independent agency within the judiciary responsible for articulating federal sentencing guidelines—drew reactions of horror and condemnation from criminal justice advocates.</p>

<p>"Bill Otis is a terrible choice," says Jason Pye, the vice president of legislative affairs at FreedomWorks, a conservative organization that has supported criminal justice reform. "Really, anyone who approaches criminal justice policy with an antiquated worldview is a bad choice for such an important post."</p>

<p>Jonathan Blanks, a research associate at the Cato Institute's Project on Criminal Justice, says Trump's nomination of Otis "signals another step back into the discredited 'tough on crime' policies of the 1980s."</p>

<p>"Otis's support of lengthy mandatory minimum sentences is outdated and counterproductive to effective criminal justice policy," Blanks continues. "If confirmed, my hope is that Mr. Otis makes himself familiar with the reams of data that undermine his previously expressed positions on the efficacy of mandatory minimum sentencing."</p>

<p>The choice is also interesting because Otis once said the commission should be scrapped altogether.</p>

<p>"Pending repeal and replacement of the [Sentencing Reform Act of 1984], Congress should abolish the Sentencing Commission," Otis testified at a 2011 House Judiciary Committee hearing. "By far the most important purpose for which it was created no longer exists—to write binding rules for district courts to use in sentencing. It does have some secondary functions—for example, to study possible statutory improvements, as well as gather and publish statistics about sentencing practices—but when its core function has been demoted to making increasingly ignored non-rules, it's time to turn the page."</p>

<p>Otis also played a role in efforts to scuttle the Smarter Sentencing Act, a 2014 sentencing reform bill and a precursor to the current bipartisan legislation moving through the Senate.</p>

<p>As a lengthy 2015 Slate profile explained, Otis thinks giving judges leeway to depart from mandatory minimum sentences is just a way to coddle violent criminals. And when that happens, his logic goes, crime rises.</p>

<p>Otis has warned time and time again over his career that criminal justice reforms would lead to chaos in the streets, but as Julie Stewart, the founder of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, wrote in Reason in 2015, he has been wrong over and over. For example, when Congress reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine, Otis predicted the bill, which he dubbed the "Crack Dealers Relief Act," would result in "misery" once thousands of crack dealers would be "put back on the street prematurely."</p>

<p>Stewart writes:</p>

<p>Fortunately for those of us concerned about public safety, Otis was wrong again—amazingly wrong. Since passage of the [Fair Sentencing Act (FSA)], the crime rate, the prison population, and crack usage are all down! It bears repeating. Otis said the changes would cause "misery" and "inevitably lead to more crime." Instead, while thousands of offenders have received fairer sentences, the crime rate has fallen, crack use is down, and taxpayers have saved millions from being wasted on unnecessary prison costs.</p>

<p>The U.S. Sentencing Commission found that crack offenders who got shorter sentences because of the FSA reoffended at slightly lower rates than crack offenders who served their full-length sentences. Again: less prison time, more public safety.</p>

<p>"Otis is impervious to facts and evidence," Warren concluded.</p>

<p>If confirmed by the Senate, Otis will bring that dedication to facts and evidence to a commission he wishes didn't exist at all.</p>

<h2 id="whitehousetoutsprisonreformsbutthrowscoldwateronsentencingbill">White House Touts Prison Reforms But Throws Cold Water on Sentencing Bill</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-01</p>

<p>url: https://reason.com/blog/2018/03/01/white-house-sends-prison-reform-goals-to </p>

<p>The White House has sent a list to Congress of its guiding principles for reforming the federal prison system and expanding reentry programs for inmates, the Associated Press reported Tuesday, but it declined to support a bipartisan bill that would overhauling federal sentencing guidelines.</p>

<p>In his State of the Union speech in January, Donald Trump said the White House would press for some reforms to the federal Bureau of Prisons and reentry programs that help inmates transition back into society.</p>

<p>"As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens," Trump said. "That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance."</p>

<p>The Washington Times reported that the principles include, among others, expanding access to prison work programs, encouraging public-private partnerships that assist inmates both pre- and post-release, and prioritizing funding for federal programs with a proven track record of reducing recidivism in state prisons.</p>

<p>Criminal justice groups across the political spectrum have championed prison and reentry reform, including evangelical Christian organizations and business groups. Although Trump's presidential campaign was thick with tough-on-crime rhetoric, advocates found an influential ally in Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and a senior White House adviser.</p>

<p>Kushner has been meeting with state officials, members of congress, and advocacy groups over the past year to discuss possible reforms to the federal prison system and ways to improve reentry programs and job prospects for former inmates. Last month, the White House also hosted a roundtable discussion on prison reform.</p>

<p>Absent from these discussion, however, have been any potential changes to federal sentencing guidelines, a bugaboo for law-and-order Republicans, most notably Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p>

<p>Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has been working to pass a bipartisan sentencing reform bill, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, for the past several years. The bill would reduce some federal mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines while eliminating none and adding several new ones. Nevertheless, it is considered by criminal justice reform advocates to be the best shot at passing major legislation on the issue in more than a decade.</p>

<p>The legislation passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote last month, despite Sessions sending a letter to the committee urging it to vote the bill down. The bill is now waiting to be scheduled for a floor vote in the Senate, but the White House appears to have little to no interest in throwing its weight behind it.</p>

<p>"The sentencing reform part still does not have a pathway forward to getting done," a White House official told reporters on a conference call, according to Reuters. "By doing this in smaller bits and pushing prison reform now, this has a better chance of getting done."</p>

<p>Speaking to Iowa reporters Wednesday, Grassley fired back: "This would be a bipartisan policy win for the Administration, and it seems like a no-brainer to me that we should get this done and the president would be backing it."</p>

<p>Instead, the administration is focusing on the so-called "back end" of the criminal justice system, arguing that improving education and job opportunities for soon-to-be released inmates will give them a better shot at being productive members of society and reduce the risk of them ending up back in prison.</p>

<p>Conservatives have been emboldened by prison reform experiments in red states such as Texas and Georgia, where Republican officials now boast of lower prison populations, lower crime, and big savings to taxpayers.</p>

<p>The White House guidelines "give broad-stroke best practices to signal to Congress what this administration is willing to do," says Derek Cohen, director of Right on Crime, a conservative criminal justice group that participated in several of the White House meetings.</p>

<p>There are currently two major bipartisan bills in Congress that would address the federal Bureau of Prisons and reentry programs.</p>

<p>In the Senate, John Cornyn (R-Tx.) has introduced the CORRECTIONS Act with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). The bill would expand the ability of federal inmates to earn credits toward time in pre-release custody, as well as require the Bureau of Prisons to provide reentry and anti-recidivism programs to all inmates, among other provisions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the House, Rep. Doug Collins (R-Ga.) has introduced the Prison Reform and Redemption Act, which would also expand risk and needs assessments for inmates in federal prisons.</p>

<p>"For effective reform, you basically need everybody on board between the executive and Congress, and I think you're actually seeing that," Cohen says. "The bills vary in some significant ways, but where they overlap, you see the principles that the White House listed. If anything, I'm very optimistic about the future of this legislation and this effort more generally."</p>

<p>Democrats and progressive advocacy groups are less optimistic. Speaking at a forum on criminal justice hosted by The Atlantic on Wednesday, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a Judiciary Committee member who voted in favor of the Sentencing Reform in Corrections Act, said "the landscape looks horrible to me, and we don't see an appetite for making these kind of changes."</p>

<p>But for conservative criminal justice reformers, having the high-profile support of the Trump White House on an issue like helping inmates get a second shot is reason enough to feel good.</p>

<p>Mark Holden, the general counsel of Koch Industries and another participant in the White House discussions, said in a statement the administration guidelines "will ensure that reforms to our system increase public safety, improve our communities, and strengthen families by creating second chances for individuals who want to become productive members of society."</p>

<h2 id="jeffsessionsandchuckgrassleysparoversentencingreform">Jeff Sessions and Chuck Grassley Spar Over Sentencing Reform</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-15</p>

<p>url: https://reason.com/blog/2018/02/15/jeff-sessions-and-chuck-grassley-spar-ov </p>

<p>Today the Senate Judiciary Committee advanced a bipartisan sentencing reform bill over the protests of Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p>

<p>The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, which would reduce some federal mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines, sparked a testy back-and-forth between Sessions and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).</p>

<p>In a letter to the committee yesterday, Sessions warned that passing the proposed legislation would be a "grave error."</p>

<p>"In recent years, convicted drug traffickers and other violent criminals have received significant sentencing breaks from the federal courts and the United States Sentencing Commission." Sessions wrote. "Passing this legislation to further reduce sentences for drug traffickers in the midst of the worst drug crisis in our nation's history would make it more difficult to achieve our goals and have potentially dire consequences."</p>

<p>Sessions was a staunch opponent of efforts to roll back mandatory minimums during his time as an Alabama Republican senator. So was Grassley, a traditional law-and-order conservative, but in a turnabout, he's now leading the efforts of a core group of Republicans and Democrats who have been trying to overhaul federal sentencing laws for several years.</p>

<p>"When I read his letter, it was almost as if Senator Sessions was back on the Judiciary Committee," Grassley shot back in a prepared statement at today's committe hearing. "But that's the problem. He is now the Attorney General and is charged with executing the laws that Congress passes, not interfering with the legislative process."</p>

<p>"Certainly we value input from the Department of Justice, but if General Sessions wanted to be involved in marking up this legislation, maybe he should have quit his job and run for the Republican Senate seat in Alabama," Grassley continued.</p>

<p>Unswayed by Sessions, the committee voted 16–5 to advance the bill to the full Senate.</p>

<p>"We don't have to report to the Justice Department," Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.) said. "We're 100 individual senators, and we can make up our own mind."</p>

<p>The bill would reduce the mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines for repeat drug offenders without serious violent felonies, and it would broaden the "safety valve" exception to federal mandatory minimum sentences. It would also add new mandatory minimum sentences for interstate domestic abuse and for providing support for terrorists, while strengthening penalties for certain other crimes.</p>

<p>An identical version of the legislation, a result of months of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans, passed out of the committee in late 2015. But it failed to ever reach the Senate floor for a vote, despite the support of a broad group of both conservative and progressive advocacy groups.</p>

<p>Many criminal justice reformers considered it the best chance in more than a decade to overhaul federal sentencing laws, but the bipartisan momentum behind it faded during a contentious election year. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), facing opposition to the bill from a small but vocal group of conservative Republicans, said he was waiting for the House to pass its own slate of criminal justice bills. That package never made to the House floor either.</p>

<p>The bill will face the same challenges now, plus a president who seems allergic to any proposals that someone might call "soft on crime." On the other hand, Trump's son-in-law—White House adviser Jared Kushner—has been meeting with Grassley and other senators over the past year to discuss criminal justice reform.</p>

<p>Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) has also emerged as key advocate for sentencing reform in the GOP caucus. "I support this not in spite of the fact I am a conservative, but precisely because I am a conservative," he said at the committee hearing.</p>

<p>Lee cited the case of Weldon Angelos, who became an unfortunate poster child for excessive sentencing after receiving a 55-year mandatory prison sentence for selling marijuana to an undercover police officer on three separate occasions. Angelos was 24 when he was sentenced and would not have been released until he was 72. He was granted an early release last year after more than a decade of advocacy on his behalf, including by Lee.</p>

<p>Grassley, Lee, Kushner, and the coalition of groups supporting the bill will have to contend not just with Sessions and like-minded Republicans, but with outside law enforcement groups whose opinions are near and dear to the president's heart.</p>

<p>The Fraternal Order of Police, which touts itself as the largest police union in the country, sent a letter to Trump today urging the White House to oppose the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act.</p>

<p>"At a time when our nation is being ravaged by an epidemic of overdose from the use of heroin and opioids, it seems at variance with common sense and sound policy to drastically reduce sentences for drug traffickers and then apply these reduced sentences retroactively," the letter argued. "This same troubling approach was taken by the previous Administration and thousands of offenders benefitted from early release without any consideration to the impact on public safety. We cannot explain why proponents of this bill seek to repeat this same error."</p>

<h2 id="westvirginiacopfiredfornotshootingsuicidalmansettleslawsuitagainstcity">West Virginia Cop Fired For Not Shooting Suicidal Man Settles Lawsuit Against City</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>GoFundMe</p>

<p>A former West Virginia police officer who was fired after not shooting a suicidal man wielding an unloaded gun has reached a settlement in a wrongful termination lawsuit that has drawn national headlines.</p>

<p>The city of Weirton, W.V., agreed on Friday to pay Stephen Mader, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served two tours of duty, $175,000 to dismiss his lawsuit against the city and the Weirton Police Department.</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and the law office of Timothy O'Brien filed a federal lawsuit on Mader's behalf last year, after the Weirton Police Department fired him for failing to shoot Ronald Williams, a 21-year-old black man Mader believed was trying to commit "suicide by cop."</p>

<p>"At the end of the day, I'm happy to put this chapter of my life to bed," Mader said in a statement. "The events leading to my termination were unjustified and I'm pleased a joint resolution has been met. My hope is that no other person on either end of a police call has to go through this again."</p>

<p>Reason reported last May, after Mader's lawsuit was filed:</p>

<p>Williams' girlfriend had called 911 to report he was threatening to kill himself, and that he had an unloaded gun.</p>

<p>"When I arrived at the scene, Mr. Williams was pleading for me to shoot him. He didn't appear angry or aggressive," Mader said in a statement. "He seemed depressed. As a Marine vet that served in Afghanistan and as an active member of the National Guard, all my training told me he was not a threat to others or me. Because of that I attempted to deescalate the situation. I was just doing my job."</p>

<p>Shortly after, another officer arrived on the scene and fatally shot Williams after Williams raised his gun. The gun was unloaded. State investigators later determined the shooting was justified.</p>

<p>Roughly a month later, Mader received a termination letter from the police department that stated he had "failed to eliminate a threat."</p>

<p>After the incident started to attract negative media attention, Weirton police officials held a press conference saying Mader had "multiple" prior conduct incidents. According to the lawsuit, the officer who shot Williams texted Mader after the press conference, and called him a "coward" who "didn't have the balls to save [his] own life."</p>

<p>Travis Blosser, Weirton's city manager, told The Washington Post the city is "pleased to see that the matter is over with."</p>

<p>Mader has not returned to law enforcement and now works as a truck driver.</p>

<p>"The termination of Stephen Mader was yet another incident exposing the toxic culture that infects far too many police departments in America," ACLU-WV executive director Joseph Cohen said in a statement. "We need to give law enforcement officers tools to effectively serve their communities. That means we need to invest in de-escalation training, implicit bias training and crisis intervention training. Hopefully the resolution of this lawsuit will send a message to the City of Weirton and police departments across the country that our communities deserve thoughtful, compassionate, transparent law enforcement."</p>

<p>Three years ago, the District of Columbia joined a growing number of jurisdictions that were reforming their civil asset forfeiture laws amid civil liberties concerns. The District enacted strong new protections for property owners, as well as transparency requirements that police show exactly how much they were seizing from residents every year.</p>

<p>But three years later, D.C. residents, journalists, and advocacy groups have no idea how the reforms are working. The District's law enforcement has illegally dragged its feet, and not a single required annual transparency report has been released. The department says it's still compiling its first report, as it says it has been doing for the past two years.</p>

<p>In December of 2014, the D.C. Council unanimously passed an asset forfeiture reform bill that, among other things, mandated the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and the D.C. Attorney General's office post annual reports of asset forfeiture activities to their websites, as well as submit those reports to the Council.</p>

<p>Lack of transparency is one of the biggest challenges to monitoring civil asset forfeiture, a practice that allows police to seize property suspected of being connected to criminal activity without convicting, or even charging, the owner.</p>

<p>A report last year by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning public-interest law firm that has challenged asset forfeiture laws in several states, found that a majority of states had little to no transparency or reporting requirements surrounding the practice.</p>

<p>The District's new transparency requirements went into effect on Jan. 1, 2016, but the annual reports for the past two years are nowhere to be found. They don't appear on either MPD or the A.G.'s websites. Likewise, the D.C. Council has not received any.</p>

<p>The Institute for Justice filed public records requests with the D.C. Council and the A.G.'s office for the required reports. In both instances, the Council and the A.G.'s office said they had no responsive documents.</p>

<p>"These transparency requirements are extremely important, because without the data these reports provide, lawmakers and the public are really not able to hold law enforcement accountable for any of their forfeiture activities," Jennifer McDonald, a research analyst at the Institute for Justice, says. "This type of data allows us to make decisions about forfeiture policies. It would show us how often forfeitures actually advance criminal investigations. Without this information we're all left in the dark, and when you consider that all of these forfeited properties become public property, the fact that the public has no information on property that belongs to it is particularly concerning."</p>

<p>In response to questions from the D.C. Council last February, the MPD projected it would release its first report in the summer of 2017. The A.G.'s office testified that it couldn't complete its report without MPD's numbers.</p>

<p>In response to a press inquiry, an MPD spokesperson said the department is still compiling its first report.</p>

<p>"After further evaluation it was noted that additional data was needed before publishing asset forfeiture activity on our website," the spokesperson said. "We are currently in the process of analyzing and organizing the data, in hopes of releasing it in the near future."</p>

<p>That's what MPD told the A.G.'s office last year, too.</p>

<p>"OAG's Civil Enforcement Section has been in contact with MPD regarding these obligations, and MPD's General Counsel indicates that the police department is currently preparing the list of all property seized in 2016," the A.G.'s office told the Council last February.</p>

<p>In the meantime, MPD isn't following the law, dragging the A.G.'s office along with it, and no one can evaluate what sort of impact the new requirements have had on asset forfeiture activities in D.C., or if civil asset forfeiture laws are being abused.</p>

<p>The D.C. Council will again ask the MPD about the status of its asset forfeiture reports in the coming weeks. However, like many transparency laws, there's little to no consequences for flouting the requirements, and the Council has limited power to prod MPD into action.</p>

<p>"The committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety has requested from MPD and the Office of the Attorney General their annual reports on asset forfeiture, but it hasn't been provided," Erik Salmi, a spokesperson for Ward 6 Councilmember Charles Allen, says. "In the next four weeks, the Committee will be conducting annual oversight hearings of both offices where we'll have a conversation about this topic among others."</p>

<h2 id="trumpsaysinsotuthatadministrationwillpursueprisonreforms">Trump Says In SOTU That Administration Will Pursue Prison Reforms</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-30</p>

<p>WIN MCNAMEE/UPI/Newscom</p>

<p>President Trump said his administration will pursue reforms to the federal prison system and its reentry programs as part of his 2018 State of the Union speech tonight.</p>

<p>"As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens," Trump said. "That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance."</p>

<p>The comments are somewhat of a change in tone for Trump, who made tough-on-crime rhetoric a hallmark of his stump speeches as a presidential candidate in 2016. He decried Obama's clemency initiatives and referenced "American carnage" from out-of-control crime in his inauguration speech.</p>

<p>But Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner has been meeting privately with conservative criminal justice reform advocates on a regular basis over the past years, as well as lawmakers on the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee. Kushner has made criminal justice reform, which has been stalled in Congress for the past several years despite what appeared to be growing momentum, one of several key priorities.</p>

<p>In January, the White House held a roundtable discussion on reforms to prisons and reentry programs for former inmates—much more palatable to conservatives, especially Attorney General Jeff Sessions, than changes to sentencing laws.</p>

<p>"We support our law enforcement partners, and we're working to reduce crime and put dangerous offenders behind bars," Trump said at the roundtable. "At the same time, we want to ensure that those who enter the justice system are able to contribute to their communities after they leave prison, which is one of many very difficult subjects we're discussing, having to do with our great country."</p>

<p>Mark Holden, the general counsel for Koch Industries and a prominent conservative advocate for criminal justice reform, said in a statement that Trump's comments State of The Union comments were "very encouraging and we look forward to continuing to work with the White House, the administration, members of Congress and states to make this vision a reality nationwide."</p>

<p>"We applaud the president for acknowledging the need to change our policies and expectations around prisons, which are failing to equip individuals to successfully return to society and succeed," Holden said. "Prisons should focus on rehabilitation, reformation, and redemption. Reducing crime starts with lowering recidivism and the best way to do that is to make sure that incarcerated individuals—over 95 percent of whom will one day be released—leave prison better than when they arrived."</p>

<p>Holden is also the chair of the advisory council for Safe Streets &amp; Second Chances, a new $4 million initiative launched by Koch Industries and the Texas Public Policy Foundation last week. The initiative will work with 1,000 participants in four states— Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and Pennsylvania—to improve job opportunities and reentry back into society for former prisoners.</p>

<p>"We are incredibly pleased that President Trump took time this evening to recognize the importance of reforming our corrections policies," said Brooke Rollins, President and CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation. "History shows that it's not enough to simply lock people up and then release them with no plan for reentering their communities. We must build on the approach used in states to rehabilitate incarcerated individuals so that they're less likely to wind up back behind bars."</p>

<p>Pat Nolan, the director of the American Conservative Union Foundation's Center for Criminal Justice Reform, called Trump's comments "a milestone in the growing conservative movement to apply conservative principles to our justice system."</p>

<p>"Our reforms reflect our values of accountability for both offenders as well as government agencies, support for crime victims, treating each person with dignity and offering a second chance," Nolan said. "We have worked with President Trump and his staff on crafting these proposals that reflect these values."</p>

<h2 id="alecurgesstatetoreformdrugfreeschoolzonelaws">ALEC Urges State to Reform Drug-Free School Zone Laws</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-26</p>

<p>Jim Weber/ZUMA Press/Newscom</p>

<p>The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative, pro-business organization that drafts model bills for state legislatures, passed a resolution Friday urging states to reform their drug-free school zone laws.</p>

<p>The conservative group is the latest in a growing bipartisan chorus opposing punitive drug-free school zone laws, which exist in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>"Most Drug-Free Zone laws were established decades ago," the resolution says, "but have not been reformed despite evidence that Drug-Free Zones are arbitrary and often unnecessarily broad, are ineffective at deterring drug- related crime, and create significant unintended consequences, including unwarranted disparate impacts on minority defendants."</p>

<p>That's exactly what a December Reason investigation into Tennessee's Drug-Free School Zone Act found.</p>

<p>Tennessee's drug-free school zones extend 1,000 feet from the real property of every school, library, park, and daycare in the state. Using GIS data obtained from the state, Reason found there were 8,544 separate drug-free zones in Tennessee, amounting to 5 percent of the overall area of the state and 26 percent of urban areas.</p>

<p>Those enhanced sentencing zones were rarely, if ever, used to prosecute drug crimes involving children, according to interviews with prosecutors and defense attorneys. But they did result in first-time and low-level drug offenders receiving longer prison sentences than if they had been found guilty of second-degree murder or rape. Sentencing data also showed wide racial disparities in who received drug-free school zone sentences, with blacks making up 69 percent of all current inmates serving time for violations of the act, despite only making up 17 percent of the state population.</p>

<p>The zones, which tend to cluster in low-income and minority neighborhoods, also give prosecutors immense leverage to squeeze plea deals out of defendants.</p>

<p>Several states have passed reforms to their laws over the past decade, shrinking the size and number of zones. The Tennessee legislature is considering a similar reform this year to shrink its zones from 1,000 feet to 500 feet. A bipartisan group of civil liberties and criminal justice organizations are supporting the bill, such as Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM).</p>

<p>"Conservative lawmakers recognize that drug-free school zone laws have proven to be a costly failure," FAMM president Kevin Ring said in a statement on the ALEC resolution. "These laws stick low-level offenders with long sentences even when no children are involved and, as a result, they waste resources that could be better spent on more serious offenders."</p>

<p>One of those offenders is Calvin Bryant, a 32-year-old Tennesse inmate serving a 17-year sentence for selling pills to a police informant. Bryant was charged in 2009 with an enhanced school-zone sentence because the housing project he lived in happened to be within 1,000 feet of a school. He was a first-time offender.</p>

<p>As Reason reported, Tennessee attorney Daniel Horwitz filed an Eighth Amendment petition on behalf of Bryant in November challenging his sentence as grossly disproportionate to his crime</p>

<p>This week, a Tennessee state judge rejected Bryant's petition, while also writing that it "also feels it necessary to note that in spite of this finding, the Court agrees with the basic argument of his petition—that his sentence can be viewed as harsh."</p>

<p>"While not ignoring the important policy rationale that led the Tennessee legislature to pass the Act," the judge continued, "the fact remains that in certain situations, such as with the Petitioner, a strict interpretation and enforcement of the Act can lead to sentences that courts and and some members of the community would be hard-pressed to describe as fair."</p>

<h2 id="ayearafterreformsvirginiastillsuspendsnearly1milliondriverslicensesforcourtdebts">A Year After Reforms, Virginia Still Suspends Nearly 1 Million Driver’s Licenses For Court Debts</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-24</p>

<p>url: http://reason.com/blog/2018/01/24/a-year-after-reforms-virginia-still-susp </p>

<p>Last February, the Virginia court system announced big changes to its rules to keep poor residents from having their driver's licenses suspended simply because of their inability to pay court fines and fines. But a year later, nearly 1 million Virginians—one out of every six licensed drivers in the state—still have suspended licenses for unpaid court debts, according to a new report released Wednesday.</p>

<p>"It appears that these reforms have done little, if anything, to stem the breathtaking current of Virginians losing their licenses," the report by the Legal Aid Justice Center, a Virginia-based legal aid group, concludes.</p>

<p>The Legal Aid Justice Center found that, as of December 2017, nearly one million Virginians had their driver's licenses suspended at least in part due to court debt, and nearly two-thirds of those—638,003—were suspended solely for unpaid court debts.</p>

<p>Civil liberties groups argue that using license suspensions to punish people for unpaid court debts is both unfair and illogical: It deprives them of the means to get to work to pay off their debt and forces many to make the choice between losing their jobs or driving on a suspended license, which carries another stiff fine.</p>

<p>The Legal Aid Justice Center filed a federal class-action lawsuit last year arguing Virginia's policy was unconstitutional. That suit was dismissed on procedural grounds, but the U.S. district court judge in the case wrote that the state's practice of suspending licenses without determining ability to pay "may very well violate Plaintiffs' constitutional rights to due process and equal protection."</p>

<p>Robert Taylor, a 28-year-old Virginia resident whose license had been suspended, told Reason in an interview last year that he was buried under a small mountain of debt from repeated fines, unemployed, and unable to find a new job because of his lack of mobility.</p>

<p>"It's kind of like my feet are cut off," Taylor said. "I can't get anywhere. I want a job. I'll see a job, and when I find one I'm qualified for—I know I could run that store so well—but I can't get to it. Public transportation just isn't there. The bus will bring you in, but it won't take you back out. The only way to do it is to hopefully know someone who will give you a ride. So many of my friends have gotten traffic tickets that they've moved closer to town."</p>

<p>In response to growing criticism, the Virginia Supreme Court announced that it would require lower courts to offer deferred or installment payment plans to defendants who couldn't afford imposed fines and fees.</p>

<p>Wednesday's report says, though, that its review of 116 general district courts found that "not one gives any indication of how it evaluates ability to pay, and correspondingly, the inability to pay."</p>

<p>"Most alarmingly, significant numbers of courts fail to consider debtors' financial situations or provide low-income debtors with alternatives to rigid payment plan terms," the report continues. "The results can be devastating for individuals and their families forced to pay beyond their abilities."</p>

<p>Virginia is not the only state in which fines from small infractions have left large numbers of people unable to drive legally. At least seven other states suspend licenses for unpaid court debts, a 2010 Brennan Center report found. California has suspended more than 4 million licenses for unpaid fines, according to a 2015 report by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>

<p>In December, a federal judge ruled that Michigan's driver's license suspension policy likely violated due process and enjoined the state from enforcing it. And last October, a federal judge reinstated the licenses of two Tennessee residents who are part of a class action lawsuit challenging the state's policies.</p>

<p>Since the Justice Department released a 2015 report on Ferguson, Missouri's rapacious use of fines and fees as a revenue source, the issue has been in the national spotlight. In a 2015 "dear colleague" letter, Vanita Gupta, the former head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, wrote that "state and local courts are encouraged to avoid suspending driver's licenses as a debt collection tool, reserving suspension for cases in which it would increase public safety."</p>

<p>"Research has consistently found that having a valid driver's license can be crucial to individuals' ability to maintain a job, pursue educational opportunities, and care for families," Gupta wrote. "At the same time, suspending defendants' licenses decreases the likelihood that defendants will resolve pending cases and outstanding court debts, both by jeopardizing their employment and by making it more difficult to travel to court, and results in more unlicensed driving."</p>

<p>The Justice Department under the Trump administration has since rescinded that guidance.</p>

<h2 id="dallascashbailsystemleavespoorlanguishinginjaillawsuitsays">Dallas Cash Bail System Leaves Poor Languishing In Jail, Lawsuit Says</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-22</p>

<p>Jim Mahoney/MCT/Newscom</p>

<p>Shannon Daves has been held in solitary confinement at the Dallas County, Texas, jail for nearly a week because she can't afford a $500 bail.</p>

<p>Daves, 47, an unemployed, homeless transgender woman accused of theft, is one of hundreds of criminal defendants in Dallas County languishing behind bars every day simply because of their inability to make bail, according to three civil rights groups.</p>

<p>Those groups—the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Civil Rights Corps, and Texas Fair Defense Project—filed a federal class-action lawsuit late Sunday night on behalf of Daves and five other named plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of Dallas County's bail policies. In all six of the plaintiffs' cases, their arraignments lasted less than a minute, and the judges never asked about their income or ability to pay before setting bail.</p>

<p>Dallas County, which includes the city of Dallas, is the latest to be hit in a wave of lawsuits around the country challenging the constitutionality cash bail policies. Similar challenges have been filed in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee. Last April, a federal judge issued a stunning ruling that found the bail practices in Harris County, Texas, were unconstitutional and ordered almost all misdemeanor defendants to be released within 24 hours.</p>

<p>Civil liberties groups say cash bail practices like Dallas County's keep defendants, who are presumed innocent, behind bars because of their inability to pay—essentially a debtor's prison. Sunday's lawsuit claims about 70 percent of the jail population are there because they can't afford bail. The cost to county taxpayers, the civil rights groups estimate, amounts to $225,321 per day.</p>

<p>Brandon Buskey, an ACLU senior staff attorney, argues that system violates the core constitutional principles of equal protection and due process.</p>

<p>"The current situation is that the county operates a wealth-based system of detention," he says. "Every day people are held in jail simply because they can't afford very small amounts of money. On the other hand, if you're wealthier you go free, often within a few hours."</p>

<p>The civil rights groups argue that even short stays in jail can have devastating consequences for defendants, especially poor ones. "Pretrial detention of presumptively innocent human beings causes people to lose their jobs and shelter, interrupts vital medication cycles, and separates parents and children," the lawsuit states. "It coerces guilty pleas and results in longer sentences."</p>

<p>Around one-third of inmates at the Dallas County Jail have some form of mental illness, according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>Dallas County officials began working to reform their bail policies last year, after the Dallas Morning News reported on the case of a grandmother who spent two months in jail after shoplifting two school uniforms worth $105. Her bond was set at $150,000, of which $15,000 was nonrefundable.</p>

<p>Opposing such reform efforts is the professional bail bond industry. Industry represenativies have filed lawsuits in New Jersey and New Mexico arguing that denial of cash bail is actually a violation of defendants' constitutional rights.</p>

<p>"What that does, in a nutshell, is it takes something that is constitutionally protected as a liberty-preserving option and turns it into an option of last resort," former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement, now working for the American Bail Coalition, argued before a New Jersey judge last year.</p>

<p>Civil liberties groups, however, say that the bail bond industry's opposition is little more than an attempt to preserve its bottom line.</p>

<p>"Most people who go through the system in Dallas county or elsewhere in the country can be released without any worry and without any condition on their liberty," Buskey says. "For those who present some risk, money is not the answer. The bail bond industry's efforts to save itself by asserting that, somehow, cash bail is needed to keep people safe is just that—a self-interested and desperate attempt to keep their livelihood going."</p>

<h2 id="alabamarakedind22millionincivilassetforfeiturein2015">Alabama Raked in $2.2 Million in Civil Asset Forfeiture in 2015</h2>

<p>The day in 2007 that Alabama police raided his stepfather's house on suspicion of growing marijuana, Robert Bradford remembers the sheriff looking out the window and remarking, "This'll make a great shooting range for training the police department, this property."</p>

<p>Royce Williams, Bradford's stepfather, had been growing and using marijuana to manage pain from several surgeries, according to his family. He wasn't a drug dealer, they said. But that didn't matter to local law enforcement, which initiated court proceedings to seize the 40 acres of property that had been in his family for generations.</p>

<p>Under a controversial tool called civil asset forfeiture, prosecutors continued to pursue the property even after Williams' 2009 suicide—a last-ditch attempt to keep it in his family's name. Williams' wife, battling terminal cancer, continued to fight in federal court and ultimately won, although she went deep into debt.</p>

<p>Williams' case was one of several profiled in a report on civil asset forfeiture released today by two civil rights groups, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law &amp; Justice.</p>

<p>Alabama law enforcement raked in roughly $2.2 million through civil asset forfeiture in 2015, according to the report, which examined forfeiture cases in 14 counties. The report reveals a widespread lack of transparency, uncovers large racial disparities, and shows that marijuana offenses were a major driver of forfeiture actions.</p>

<p>Under civil asset forfeiture laws, police can seize property suspected of being connected to criminal activity, even if the owner is never charged with a crime. In a quarter of the 827 asset forfeiture cases examined in the report, no criminal charges were filed against property owners.</p>

<p>Law enforcement groups say asset forfeiture is a crucial tool to disrupt drug trafficking and other organized crime. Civil libertarians reply that there are far too few protections for innocent property owners, who must go to court to challenge seizures, and far too many perverse profit incentives for police and prosecutors.</p>

<p>The total value awarded in the Alabama cases where no criminal charges were filed amounted to more than $670,000. In half of the full set of cases, the amount of cash was $1,372 or less—too little for most people to bother hiring a lawyer to recover.</p>

<p>"With more than $5 million a year coming to Alabama law enforcement agencies through state and federal civil asset forfeiture laws, the profit motive can too easily overshadow the fair administration of justice," the report says.</p>

<p>Those concerns have led more than half of the states across the U.S. to enact some form of civil asset forfeiture reform. Today, in a joint press conference with the civil rights groups, two Republican state legislators announced they would be introducing a bill to require criminal convictions for forfeitures, as well as strengthening protections for innocent property owners and adding new reporting requirements.</p>

<p>"No criminal should be able to profit off of their crime," Alabama GOP state Sen. Arthur Orr said in a press release. "Our laws must also protect innocent Alabama property owners. Currently, Alabama law does not provide those basic protections."</p>

<p>The report found that 42 percent of all the civil asset forfeiture cases studied were related to marijuana offenses. In 18 percent of the cases where criminal charges were filed, the charge was simple possession of marijuana and/or paraphernalia.</p>

<p>The report also showed racial disparities in who is being hit with civil forfeiture in Alabama. African Americans made up 64 percent of cases where criminal charges were filed, even though they comprise only about 27 percent of Alabama's population.</p>

<p>Chase Dearman, defense attorney a Mobile, Alabama, says in the report that the government has seized petty cash from his clients' wallets and furniture off their walls.</p>

<p>"The law is not inherently racist, but I do believe the practical applications become that way," Dearman says in the report. "I have never had a Caucasian client who has had a narcotics officer unscrew the TVs from their walls and take them out the front door and confiscate them. However, it is a common occurrence with African-American clients."</p>

<p>A Reason investigation of public records and court filings in Mississippi revealed similar cases, such as one where local police seized a woman's furniture, including paintings and lamps, on suspicion that her boyfriend was a drug dealer. After fighting in court for several years, the woman eventually had all her furniture returned except the couch, which the prosecutor kept as part of a settlement deal.</p>

<p>To collect the data, the report's researchers had to trawl Alabama county courts. That turned out to to be the easy part.</p>

<p>Researchers sent records requests to 138 agencies trying to track where asset forfeiture funds went after they were awarded and how they were spent. Only 38 agencies responded, and most of those either did not keep the records or refused to release them.</p>

<p>Alabama doesn't have any transparency or reporting requirements surrounding asset forfeiture. Last year, the state earned an "F" grade from the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning public-interest law firm that has challenged asset forfeiture laws in several states, for its lack of transparency.</p>

<p>"Due to Alabama's lack of forfeiture reporting, it is impossible to know how many innocent people have been caught up in the state's forfeiture machine," the Institute for Justice's Jennifer McDonald wrote in an op-ed for AL.com last year.</p>

<p>The two civil rights groups recommend abolishing civil asset forfeiture altogether, a change that would require law enforcement to secure a criminal conviction before taking someone's property through forfeiture. They also recommend strengthening protections for innocent property owners, improving forfeiture reporting requirements, and funneling forfeiture revenues to Alabama's General Fund instead of directly into police and prosecutor budgets.</p>

<p>"It's time for Alabama lawmakers to place the burden where it belongs—on the government," Sam Brooke, deputy legal director for the SPLC, said in a statement. "Civil asset forfeiture is broken beyond repair. We urge legislators to ensure that only people convicted of a crime can lose their property through criminal forfeiture and to bring transparency and accountability to the forfeiture process."</p>

<p>Robert Bradford now lives on his stepfather and mother's property. "In a country where due process runs everything, this seems to have slipped through the cracks," he said at the press conference.</p>

<h2 id="billintroducedtostopcivilforfeiturefundingofdeamarijuanaeradicationprogram">Bill Introduced to Stop Civil Forfeiture Funding of DEA Marijuana Eradication Program</h2>

<p>date: 2018-01-18</p>

<p>url: http://reason.com/blog/2018/01/18/bill-introduced-to-stop-civil-forfeiture </p>

<p>Randall Benton/TNS/Newscom</p>

<p>Citing waste of taxpayer dollars, shifting public opinion, and constitutional concerns, Reps. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) and Justin Amash (R-Mich.) have introduced a bill in Congress that would block funds from the federal government's controversial asset forfeiture fund from being used for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) marijuana eradication program.</p>

<p>The Stop Civil Asset Forfeiture Funding for Marijuana Suppression Act, first introduced in 2015, would use Congress' power of the purse to block money from the Justice Department's Asset Forfeiture Fund from being used to support the DEA's Domestic Cannabis Suppression/Eradication Program.</p>

<p>According to the DEA, the program was responsible in 2016 for the eradication of more than 5 million marijuana plants, more than 5,000 arrests, and the seizure of more than of $51 million from marijuana cultivators.</p>

<p>Under civil asset forfeiture laws, police can seize property and money suspected of being connected to criminal activity, even if the owner is not charged with a crime. Law enforcement groups argue it is a vital tool to disrupt drug trafficking and other organized crime. However, civil liberties advocates say there are far too few protections for innocent property owners and far too many profit incentives police and prosecutors.</p>

<p>For example, in 2009 federal prosecutors unsuccessfully fought to seize a farm from an Alabama woman after her husband was caught growing marijuana on the property. Her husband, who said he used the marijuana to manage chronic pain, committed suicide during his trial in a last-ditch attempt to keep the farm in family hands, as it had been for generations. His wife was never charged with a crime.</p>

<p>"Civil asset forfeiture is an unconstitutional practice whereby the government takes people's property without due process," Amash, one of the more libertarian members of Congress, said in a joint statement with Lieu. "The DEA's use of proceeds acquired through civil asset forfeiture to expand marijuana enforcement—a state-level issue—makes the already unacceptable practice even worse."</p>

<p>Lieu called the DEA eradication program "a waste of time and money and runs contrary to the will of the people."</p>

<p>"The Federal Government has a responsibility to spend taxpayer money wisely," he said. "Instead, A.G. Jeff Sessions would rather waste federal dollars by attacking marijuana, which has been legalized either for medical or recreational use in the majority of states in the U.S."</p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a longtime supporter of the drug war, recently rescinded Obama-era guidance to U.S Attorneys on marijuana enforcement, sparking fears of a federal crackdown on the drug, which is now legal at the state level for recreational use in eight states and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>A new poll conducted by Mason-Dixon Polling and Strategy and released by Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM), an anti-legalization group, found that only 16 percent of Americans support keeping the current federal policy on marijuana, while 49 percent favor full legalization for recreational use.</p>

<p>The bill also has the support of marijuana legalization groups.</p>

<p>"Never in modern history has there existed greater public support for ending the nation's nearly century-long experiment with marijuana prohibition," Justin Strekal, the political director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said in a statement. "With eight states and the District of Columbia now having legalized its personal use and 30 states having legalized medical marijuana, it is time that the DEA cease interfering with state-legal programs and stop wasting taxpayer dollars that would be better directed at going after the pill-mills contributing to the nations opioid crisis."</p>

<p>Scroll through the carefully manicured Twitter account of Sen. Kamala Harris, a rising star in the Democratic Party and one of the newest members of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, and you'll find many references to "justice."</p>

<p>Harris is one of the strongest voices in the Senate for criminal justice reform and rolling back the drug war. However, during Harris' time as a prosecutor and eventually California attorney general, her offices repeatedly tried to tip the scales of justice in favor of prosecutors.</p>

<p>Such tactics aren't unusual among state prosecutors, unfortunately, but they are revealing.</p>

<p>When a judge removed the entire Orange County District Attorney's Office from a death penalty trial in 2015—after it was revealed in a bombshell memo that the sheriff's department had been running an unconstitutional jailhouse informant program—Harris' office appealed the removal.</p>

<p>"The Attorney General believes the findings of the court regarding the discovery violations in this case are serious and demand further investigation," the California A.G.'s office said in a statement. "But, as the court found, 'there is no direct evidence that the District Attorney actively participated in the concealment of this information from the defense and the court.'"</p>

<p>In 2015, the California Attorney General did announce it was conducting an investigation into the affair, but that report has yet to be released. In the meantime, the jailhouse snitch scandal has tainted more than a dozen criminal cases, including several murder trials.</p>

<p>Harris' record as San Francisco D.A. has similar instances. In 2010, a California superior court judge excoriated Harris' office for failing to notify defense lawyers of known misconduct by a drug lab technician that later led the San Francisco police to shut down an entire section of the lab.</p>

<p>The judge wrote that an internal office memo showed that prosecutors "at the highest levels of the district attorney's office knew that Madden was not a dependable witness at trial and that there were serious concerns regarding the crime lab."</p>

<p>The judge wrote that Harris' office had some "duty to implement some type of procedure to secure and produce information relevant to Madden's criminal history." However, the judge's requests that prosecutors explain why nothing happened were met with "a level of indifference."</p>

<p>As California Attorney General, Harris' office continued to display indifference toward concerns of misconduct. In March 2015, the California A.G. appealed the dismissal of a child molestation case after a Kern County prosecutor falsified an interview transcript to add an incriminating confession.</p>

<p>Harris' office, citing state court precedent, tried to argue that the prosecutor's action "was certainly conscience shocking in the sense that it involved false testimony by a prosecutor in a formal criminal proceeding. But it did not involve 'brutal and … offensive' conduct employed to obtain a conviction." In other words, the defendant's false confession wasn't beaten out of him, and therefore didn't violate his constitutional rights. The judge disagreed and threw out the conviction.</p>

<p>In another 2015 case, Baca v. Adams, Harris' office opposed a post-conviction appeal by a defendant who was sentenced after the prosecutor in his case lied to the jury about whether an informant received compensation for his testimony. A state court found the prosecutor's testimony was "sheer fantasy," but declined to overturn the conviction.</p>

<p>The former chief judge of the 9th Circuit, Alex Kozinski, an outspoken critic of prosecutorial misconduct (himself now retired amid sexual harassment allegations), proceeded to rhetorically flay the deputy attorney general who had the unfortunate job of defending the A.G.'s position that the prosecutor had not lied. Kozinski asked why unethical prosecutors weren't being charged with perjury or disciplined at all for their misconduct.</p>

<p>"[Harris], or someone in her office, could prosecute these cases if she thought this was a serious matter that was not being handled by the local authorities," Kozinski said. "Has that happened? Has an investigation been done? Have any steps been taken to show that California does not condone prosecutors getting on the stand and lying to the jury in a criminal case?"</p>

<p>"In this case… I guess, my answer is, I suppose, other than the criticism from the court of appeal, the answer to that is no," the deputy attorney general responded.</p>

<p>Kozinski threatened that "it would look terrible in an opinion when we write it up and name names." After the video of the hearing—the courtroom equivalent of a snuff film—went viral in law circles, the California A.G.'s office filed a motion dropping its opposition, "in the interest of justice." Harris had announced she was running for the U.S. Senate about two weeks earlier, and she was, after all, very concerned about justice.</p>

<p>Allen Eyestone/ZUMA Press/Newscom</p>

<p>The U.S. government uses secret evidence to build criminal cases, according to a report released today by Human Rights Watch.</p>

<p>The report offers one of the most comprehensive looks yet at "parallel construction," a tactic where federal law enforcement hides classified or sensitive methods from courts by building a parallel chain of evidence after the fact.</p>

<p>The report shows that numerous federal law enforcement agencies send requests to local police to find reasons to perform traffic stops and searches on criminal suspects. Unless something goes wrong, defendants will never know the origins of the government's case against them.</p>

<p>Although it's difficult to find cases where parallel construction definitively occurred, the investigation "nevertheless indicates that this use of secret evidence may be occurring regularly in cases throughout the country—cases in which the person accused of an offense remains innocent until proven guilty and faces a potentially life-altering prison term."</p>

<p>The group notes that parallel construction raises several civil rights concerns, chiefly the right to a fair trial.</p>

<p>"When you have parallel construction, you have defendants and even judges who don't know how evidence was gathered and can't challenge the constitutionality of that," report author Sarah St. Vincent says. "What you have is very one-sided, where the government, on its own, is deciding what practices it thinks are legal."</p>

<p>St. Vincent says parallel construction could hide illegal searches that violate defendants' Fourth Amendment Rights, or that result in exculpatory evidence not being turned over, violating the Fifth Amendment. It could also be used to hide discriminatory actions by law enforcement.</p>

<p>The method was first revealed in a 2013 Reuters investigation, which detailed how the Special Operations Division, a secretive unit within the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), had been funneling surveillance tips to field agents and other agencies to build cases. Meanwhile, it trained agents to "recreate" evidence chains to keep classified methods hidden from defendants, judges, and even federal prosecutors.</p>

<p>According to the Human Rights Watch report, the Special Operations Division's activities were nicknamed "the dark side" and exiting agents were given Darth Vader keychains as tokens.</p>

<p>DEA training slides that I obtained via a 2014 Freedom of Information Act request shed further light on how widespread the tactic is. The FOIA request also resulted in perhaps my favorite redaction that I have ever received:</p>

<p>A DEA training slide on parallel construction</p>

<p>Although mass surveillance is usually identified with the war on terror and the National Security Agency, a subsequent USA Today investigation found the DEA and Justice Department had been collecting logs of billions of phone calls originating from the U.S. in a program that predated 9/11 by more than a decade.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch found "numerous" federal and state judicial decisions where the government admitted after the fact to carrying out what are known as "whisper," "wall," "walled off," or "wall off" stops.</p>

<p>In such stops, federal law enforcement sends tips to local police to be on the lookout for a certain vehicle at a certain time. Local police then follow the suspect's car until it performs some traffic violation, allowing the officer to legally perform a stop and establish probable cause for a search.</p>

<p>The Human Rights Watch report cites one case, Arizona v. Wakil, where a "whisper stop" requested by the DEA was used to conceal the agency's warrantless use of a GPS tracker on the defendant's rental car. An Arizona judge overturned the defendant's conviction in state court only after evidence of the whisper stop emerged in federal court.</p>

<p>Although much of the investigative reporting on parallel construction has focused on the DEA, Human Rights Watch's investigation found ATF, DHS, and the FBI had all requested such stops by local police.</p>

<p>The report recommends that Congress pass laws requiring the government to disclose to defendants the origins of the investigations of their cases, which would amount to a ban on parallel construction altogether.</p>

<p>In a January 2 article for Reason, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also called for banning parallel construction.</p>

<p>"[T]he government should be disallowed from taking that information and developing a parallel construction of a case, where the illegally obtained information is not used in court but is used by law enforcement to develop other information to mount a prosecution," Paul wrote. "Our Founders gave us the Fourth Amendment to prevent a tyrannical government from invading our privacy, and we are fools to relinquish that hard-won right because of fear."</p>

<p>Such a bill would undoubtedly face opposition from federal law enforcement, especially at the Justice Department, where Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made escalating the drug war a top priority.</p>

<p>"Does it bother me a little? Yeah," a former federal prosecutor, speaking anonymously, tells Human Rights Watch in the report. "But if it's gonna stop 100 keys [kilograms of drugs] from getting on the street, it's okay by me. I didn't make the rules. I just play by them." It's not a very fair game, though, if only one side knows the rules.</p>

<p>Because of its very nature, it's almost impossible to know often parallel construction is used.</p>

<p>"The problem with researching a coverup," St. Vincent says, "is you're not supposed to know what happened."</p>

<h2 id="themythoftheplaygroundpusher">The Myth of the Playground Pusher</h2>

<p>by: Lauren Krisai</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-18</p>

<p>On July 9, 2008, officers of the Columbia, Tennessee, police department arrested Michael Goodrum and charged him with possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute in a drug-free school zone.</p>

<p>Sounds bad, right? Surely the kind of monster who sells crack in a school yard should be put away for a long time. Lawmakers certainly think so: All 50 states and the District of Columbia have laws on the books that provide for harsh sentences for people who buy or sell drugs near schools. In Tennessee, it's considered such a serious crime under the state's Drug-Free School Zone Act of 1995 that Goodrum's charge was automatically upgraded to a Class A felony—the same category as murder.</p>

<p>But Michael Goodrum was not peddling dope to kids on a playground. He wasn't on school property, and school wasn't in session. In fact, he wasn't within sight of a school.</p>

<p>According to court testimony by the police who arrested him, the 40-year-old was sitting in a private residence at 10:30 p.m. when officers swept into the living room with a narcotics search warrant. Goodrum was ordered to the floor, and when an officer picked him up, the cop found a small bag of crack cocaine underneath him.</p>

<p>Goodrum says he was only visiting the house. He had never been convicted of a felony before.</p>

<p>Normally, he would have been facing a stiff eight years in prison for possession with intent to sell of 1.7 grams of crack cocaine. (That's about the same weight as two blueberries.) But the room he was in happened to fall within 572 feet of a park and 872 feet of a school—roughly two blocks away from either, but still well within the 1,000-foot drug-free radius created under Tennessee law.</p>

<p>After a four-year odyssey involving a hung jury and a retrial, Goodrum was convicted and sentenced to 15 years without the possibility of an early release. Had he been convicted of second-degree murder, he might have ended up serving less time in prison. That crime carries a minimum 15-year sentence but includes a possibility for release within 13.</p>

<p>Goodrum's case isn't unusual. Drug-free school zone laws are rarely if ever used to prosecute sales of drugs to minors. Such cases are largely a figment of our popular imagination—a lingering hangover from the drug war hysteria of the 1980s. Yet state legislatures have made the designated zones both larger and more numerous, to the point where they can blanket whole towns. In the process, they have turned minor drug offenses into lengthy prison sentences almost anywhere they occur.</p>

<p>In some cases, police have set up controlled drug buys inside school zones to secure harsher sentences. That gives prosecutors immense leverage to squeeze plea deals out of defendants with the threat of long mandatory minimum sentences.</p>

<p>In recent years, this approach has begun to trouble some state lawmakers, and even some prosecutors are growing uncomfortable with the enormous power—and in some cases, the obligation—they have been handed to lock away minor drug offenders.</p>

<p>Nashville District Attorney Glenn Funk ran for office in 2014 on a platform that included not prosecuting school zone violations except in cases that actually involve children. He says almost every single drug case referred to his office falls within a drug-free zone.</p>

<p>He's right. Data obtained from the Tennessee government show there are 8,544 separate drug-free school zones covering roughly 5.5 percent of the state's total land area. Within cities, however, the figures are much higher. More than 27 percent in Nashville and more than 38 percent in Memphis are covered by such zones. They apply day and night, whether or not children are present, and it's often impossible to know you're in one.</p>

<p>For a drug offender charged with possession of under half a gram of cocaine with intent to distribute, a few hundred feet can mean the difference between probation vs. eight years of hard time behind bars.</p>

<p>"In places like Nashville, almost the entire city is a drug-free zone," Funk says. "Every church has day care, and they are a part of drug-free zones. Also, public parks and seven or eight other places are included in this classification. And almost everybody who has driven a car has driven through a school zone. What we had essentially done, unwittingly, was increased drug penalties to equal murder penalties without having any real basis for protecting kids while they're in school."</p>

<p>The Rise of the Drug-Free Zone</p>

<p>Goodrum is one of 436 inmates currently serving time in Tennessee state prisons for possessing or selling drugs in a drug-free zone. The oldest of those inmates, Harry Watts, was 74 years old at the time of his sentencing. It was his first felony conviction. The youngest, Sammy Russell, was 16 when he received eight years in an adult prison for having half a gram of cocaine, or less than a packet of sugar, on him. It was his first felony conviction as well.</p>

<p>For a drug offender charged with possession of under half a gram of cocaine with intent to distribute, a few hundred feet can mean the difference between probation or release within three years, on one hand, vs. eight years of hard time behind bars without any hope of parole, on the other.</p>

<p>Tennessee's drug-free school zone laws are among the harshest in the country, but the state is far from an outlier. Statutes that increase sentences for drug crimes that occur near schools or other places where children congregate—parks, rec centers, libraries, day cares—exist in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>Congress created the first drug-free zone law in 1970 as part of the federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse, Prevention and Control Act. At the time, supporters argued that the laws deterred drug sales to children and reduced other criminal activity associated with drugs in areas around schools.</p>

<p>"Those who have a drug habit find it necessary to steal, to commit crimes, in order to feed their habit," President Richard Nixon said in a signing statement. "We found also, and all Americans are aware of this, that drugs are alarmingly on the increase in use among our young people. They are destroying the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people all over America, not just of college age or young people in their 20s, but the great tragedy: The uses start even in junior high school, or even in the late grades."</p>

<p>The law was amended in 1986, near the height of the '80s-era drug panic, to double the maximum sentence for drug distribution or manufacturing within 1,000 feet of a school, college, or playground, and to add areas within 100 feet of swimming pools, video arcades, or youth centers.</p>

<p>States followed suit. Throughout the 1980s and '90s, drug-free school zones became ubiquitous throughout the country. In the 1990s, some states expanded their zones to include public housing, shopping malls, parking lots, and amusement parks, as well as expanding the types of offenses that would be covered. Indiana expanded its drug-free zones to include public housing complexes and "youth program centers." Utah brought in movie theaters, parking lots, arcades, and malls. Washington state included bus stops.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania was the last state to enact a basic drug-free school zone law, in 1997. But a few states have expanded theirs as recently as 2015, despite widespread support for other criminal justice reforms that reduce, rather than ratchet up, penalties for nonviolent crimes. In 2011, Arkansas changed its law to allow simple drug possession offenses that occur in drug-free zones to be eligible for the state's mandatory 10-year sentencing enhancement. In 2012, Hawaii amended its law to include public housing complexes. In 2015, Texas enacted legislation that allows for opioids to be included in the list of substances eligible for a drug-free zone sentencing enhancement.</p>

<p>Tennessee. 8,544 separate drug-free school zones cover roughly 5.5 percent of the state's total area, but 26.5 percent of areas within city limits. Illustration by Lorenz Krisai.</p>

<p>Alabama has the widest drug-free zones in the country, extending three miles from schools, colleges, and housing complexes. Drug offenses inside those areas carry a five-year enhanced sentence. In practice, this means that 38,267 square miles of Alabama—73 percent of the state—are within a -drug-free zone. Cities with a higher concentration of schools and public housing projects are worse. Ninety-four percent of Montgomery falls within a drug-free zone.</p>

<p>Prosecutors and law-and-order legislators have fiercely opposed changes to these laws. When the Connecticut legislature considered shrinking the size of its drug-free zones in 2012 from 1,500 feet—a distance of more than three football fields—to 200 feet, one outraged lawmaker testified that he was "appalled as to why anyone would support a bill that puts our children at greater risk by easing restriction on drug dealers."</p>

<p>"Many children walk this distance every day to and from school, and it is our job to ensure there are laws in place which adequately protect them," Republican state Rep. Prasad Srinivasan declared. "As drugs get closer to our schools, other forms of crime and violence will certainly follow."</p>

<p>Phantom Pushers</p>

<p>The fearsome image that spurred these laws and keeps them on the books—a shifty drug dealer handing a child a bag of drugs through a chain-link fence—is little more than a phantom.</p>

<p>Funk, the Nashville district attorney, says that over the last three years he's dealt with only three drug cases that involved the actual endangerment of a child. One happened when a suspect fleeing the police ran through a middle school's grounds, sending the school into a lockdown.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, former Massachusetts Assistant Attorney General William Brownsberger conducted a review of drug cases in three Massachusetts cities. He found that 80 percent of them occurred in drug-free school zones, but almost none of them involved sales to minors.</p>

<p>"In all of those cases that we looked at, in that entire set of about 450 files from two different district attorney's offices over the course of a year, there was exactly one case of drug dealing to a minor," says Brownsberger, now a Massachusetts state senator. "That happened in an apartment late at night, and it just happened to be near a school."</p>

<p>In all the years since, he's still never come across a case of the dreaded playground pusher in action.</p>

<p>"I've been a practitioner in the area for 10 years and a legislator for another 10, and I've never seen that case," he says. "The only cases that I'm aware of involving dealing drugs on or in a school are always kids selling to other kids. Usually in those cases, you don't want them getting a two-year mandatory minimum. It's just totally inappropriate. The whole school zone concept is bankrupt and should be repealed entirely."</p>

<p>States created drug-free school zones thinking that the threat of draconian prison sentences would keep dealers away from schools. But the very size of these zones undercuts that premise. If a whole city is a drug-free zone, then the designation has no targeted deterrent effect. In practice, it exists to put more people in prison for longer periods of time, not to keep children safe.</p>

<p>"Drug-free school zone laws show how good intentions can go horribly wrong," says Kevin Ring, president of the advocacy group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. "Adult offenders who aren't selling drugs to or even near kids are getting hammered with long sentences. Most don't even know they are in a school zone. These laws aren't tough on crime. They're just dumb."</p>

<p>'We Don't Need the Police Department Setting Up Buys on School Property'</p>

<p>By covering wide swaths of densely populated areas in drug-free zones, states end up hitting low-level and first-time drug offenders with sentences usually reserved for violent crimes.</p>

<p>Tennessee's drug-free school zone laws bump up drug felonies by a level and eliminate the possibility of an early release. For example, a first-time drug offender found guilty of a Class C felony for possession with intent to distribute of less than half a gram of cocaine—which carries a maximum six-year sentence—instead receives a Class B felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of eight years.</p>

<p>These penalties are zealously applied. Knoxville criminal defense attorney Forrest Wallace says that one of his clients received an enhanced drug sentence for merely walking through a school zone that bisected the parking lot of his apartment complex on his way to meet the informant who had set him up. The client received a normal sentence for the sale of the cocaine, but an enhanced charge of possession with intent to distribute for passing through the school zone.</p>

<p>"If they can prove it's in a zone, you know they're going to charge it," Wallace says. "That's just the way it is."</p>

<p>Undercover cops and confidential informants sometimes go to extra lengths to get these enhanced sentences. David Raybin, a Nashville criminal defense attorney, says that police informants often purposely set up deals in school zones, a practice that has led to accusations of entrapment from defendants and rebukes from judges dismayed by the practice. "The police will frequently have people sell drugs in a school zone so they can enhance them," Raybin says.</p>

<p>"The only cases that I'm aware of involving dealing drugs on or in a school are always kids selling to other kids. Usually in those cases, you don't want them getting a two-year mandatory minimum. It's just totally in appropriate."</p>

<p>Tennessee resident Jordan Peters was 20 years old when he sold a bag of hallucinogenic mushrooms to a police informant at a gas station in 2010. Peters testified at trial that the informant had been "blowing up" his phone and asking for drugs. He said he told the informant that he needed to gas up his car before meeting her, and the informant suggested they just meet at the station.</p>

<p>Peters had no prior criminal history, but because the $80 drug transaction happened 587 feet from an elementary school, he received a mandatory 15 years in state prison. He will not be released until 2027.</p>

<p>Peters' case is not unusual. In a 2015 ruling upholding his sentence, Appellate Judge Camille McMullen noted her "increasing concern regarding enhancement of convictions under the Act."</p>

<p>"I simply do not believe that the Tennessee legislature intended the scope of the Act to include drugs brought into the protected school zone by law enforcement's own design," she wrote. "This concept of luring, which commonly takes the form of an undercover sting operation, is inconsistent" with the law's goal of reducing illegal drug activity around schools. (In the end, however, McMullen "reluctantly" concurred with her two fellow judges that, based on precedent, Peters' case did not amount to entrapment.)</p>

<p>In another case, a judge warned that drug stings on school grounds could create an unsafe environment for students. In 2001, police officers from Davidson County's Metro Drug Task Force testified at the trial of defendant Baudelio Nieto that they had driven Nieto to an elementary school parking lot to discuss a cocaine deal for the expressed purpose of securing an enhanced sentence against him. The tactics bothered Judge John Aaron Holt. "All the problems we are having with our schools, we don't need the Police Department setting up [drug] buys on school property," he said, according to The Tennessean. "This is not a good thing to be doing."</p>

<p>Nieto's lawyer, Mario Ramos, says he has worked on three or four cases where police set up drug transactions in drug-free zones. "Literally every time there was a drug buy, they were trying to figure out how to get near a school," Ramos says. "It led to enhanced punishment, and of course the enhanced punishment gave them a greater negotiating arm."</p>

<p>But such planning is largely unnecessary because of the ubiquity of school zones and the lack of viable defenses for drug offenders who stumble into them. Tennessee's drug-free zone laws do not include what's known as a mens rea—Latin for "guilty mind"—requirement. That means defendants are just as culpable if they had no idea they were in a drug-free zone, which in the state extend roughly three city blocks as the crow flies from designated areas.</p>

<p>The law applies even if one is driving down a closed-access highway that happens to pass through a school zone. Take the case of Danny Santarone: In 2011, a FedEx employee flagged a suspicious package (which turned out to be full of prescription opioids) addressed to Santarone. Police watched him arrive and pick up the package, but they waited to initiate a traffic stop until he was down the road, inside a school zone.</p>

<p>Top: Maury County, Tennessee. 4 percent of the county, but 21 percent of the area within city limits, is a drug-free zone. Bottom: Memphis, Tennessee. 38 percent of the area within city limits is a drug-free zone. Illustration by Lorenz Krisai.</p>

<p>Santarone later received enhanced sentences for possession of oxycodone, cocaine, and heroin with intent to distribute. A Tennessee appeals court denied his appeal in 2015, ruling that "the state is not required to prove that the defendant knew that he was committing an offense within 1,000 feet of a school, nor even that school was in session at the time of the offense."</p>

<p>Like many U.S. drug laws, drug-free school zone statutes have a disparate impact in low-income and minority neighborhoods. This can be partially explained by the fact that cities, which have a higher percentage of minority populations than rural areas do, often have overlapping drug-free zones, since schools, parks, and other youth services tend to be located near low-income housing. Eleven states explicitly include public housing complexes in their drug-free zones.</p>

<p>Sentencing data from Tennessee show minorities are indeed disproportionately represented in school zone sentences relative to their share of the population. Tennessee is 17.1 percent black, but blacks make up 69 percent of all drug-free school zone offenders currently serving time in the state.</p>

<p>The disparities continue at the county level. For example, Knox County, Tennessee, is 6.8 percent black, but blacks make up 27.6 percent of all school zone sentences.</p>

<p>"Once you start looking at these things, you'll notice that in Knox County there are certain areas of town where there's a higher population density and a higher density of restricted zones," Wallace says. "Coincidentally, a lot of those places happen to be in a poorer section of town. Knoxville is a historically segregated city, so the majority of the African-American population lives in East Knoxville. There's a huge concentration of restricted zones in East Knoxville. I always joke that you can't swing a cat without it landing in a drug-free school zone."</p>

<p>He's right, too: 39 percent of the city is covered by a drug-free zone, but in poorer East Knoxville that figure is 58 percent.</p>

<p>State Senate Minority Leader Lee Harris (D–Memphis), who has been working to reform school zone laws, describes a huge gulf between how the laws affect rural areas and major cities like Memphis.</p>

<p>"You end up creating all these different zones, and it swallows the entire city," Harris says. "You compare that to what a rural county looks like. The other 91 rural counties in the state, the vast majority of their space is not in a drug-free school zone. I have to ask those who are concerned about justice and fairness, why should drug dealers who live in cities get 15 years while drug dealers who do the same crime get 29 months because they live in a rural area? At the end of the day, drug-free zones just penalize people for living in cities. I mean, you can't get 10 years for some homicides."</p>

<p>But this is not solely an urban issue. More than 13 percent of all Tennessee inmates serving drug-free zone enhancement sentences are from rural Maury County, population 28,000. Although only 4 percent of Maury County's total area is covered by drug-free zones, 21 percent of the area within city limits in the county is covered by a drug-free zone. Of the 58 inmates from the county who are serving these sentences, 45 are black, even though African Americans make up only 0.43 percent of all Maury County residents.</p>

<p>A disproportionate number of drug-free zone inmates come from rural Sullivan County as well. Although the county accounts for roughly 2.5 percent of the state's population, over 22 percent of all drug-free zone inmates were convicted here. More than half of these inmates are black, compared with only 2.6 percent of the county's population. Like Maury County, the total area covered by drug-free zones in the county is low (8.6 percent). However, 28 percent of cities within Sullivan County are covered by these zones.</p>

<p>Minorities also receive longer drug sentences than whites for school zone violations statewide. Sentencing data show that white defendants receive eight-year sentences on average, while blacks and Hispanics receive 11.6 years and 15 years on average, respectively. Out of the top 20 longest drug sentences for school zone violations, only two of the defendants were white.</p>

<p>This pattern isn't limited to Tennessee. A 2007 study by the New Jersey Commission to Review Criminal Sentencing found that "nearly every offender (96 percent) convicted and incarcerated for a drug-free zone offense in New Jersey is either Black or Hispanic." According to the report, overlapping drug-free zones had "a devastatingly disproportionate impact on New Jersey's minority community." At one point, roughly 50 percent of both Newark and Jersey City were covered by drug-free zones.</p>

<p>A study in Connecticut showed similar results. "Two of our big cities, Bridgeport and Hartford, are completely covered by these zones," says David McGuire, executive director of the state's American Civil Liberties Union chapter. "In New Haven, the only place that's not included is the Yale golf course."</p>

<p>A 2010 report commissioned by the Illinois General Assembly also concluded that the state's drug-free zone law had a disproportionate impact on minority communities. It found that nearly 90 percent of arrests for drug-free zone violations in Illinois involved nonwhite arrestees. In Florida, a 2011 report published by the state Senate's Committee on Criminal Justice found that black offenders made up 55 percent of admissions to prison for all drug offenses in fiscal year 2009, but they made up 88 percent of those admitted to prison for a drug-free zone conviction that same year.</p>

<p>The Prosecutor's Toolkit</p>

<p>When Memphis resident Rodgerick Griffin Jr. was arrested for possession with intent to distribute a sugar packet's worth of crack cocaine in 2009, he was originally charged with a Class B felony. But because the offense occurred three blocks from a school, it was elevated to a Class A felony. Instead of a maximum eight-year sentence with parole eligibility in under three, Griffin faced a minimum of 15 years in prison with no possibility of an early release. He would have faced less time in prison under Tennessee sentencing guidelines if he had been convicted of rape or aggravated robbery.</p>

<p>The outsized sentencing mandates in drug-free school zone laws give prosecutors incredible leverage. Rational defendants are more likely to take a plea deal, even if they believe they are innocent, when the punishment from losing at trial is much more severe than the deal being offered by the prosecutor.</p>

<p>"With the enhancement, what was happening was somebody might have a couple grams of cocaine, and they'd go to court, hoping to get probation for simple possession," Funk explains. "Their lawyer would then tell them it's a school zone case, and they're looking at 15 to 25 years in prison. The state offers them eight years to serve at 30 percent, or a 10-year probationary period or something. If the client persists, the lawyer has to say, 'Do you feel lucky? Because if you go to trial and lose, you won't be home for the next couple of decades.'"</p>

<p>Available sentencing data include only defendants who went to trial, not cases where prosecutors dropped school zone charges in exchange for a guilty plea. So there are almost certainly many more Tennessee inmates serving drug sentences longer than those they would have normally received because of deals struck with prosecutors under threat of school zone sentence enhancements.</p>

<p>"There's an astronomical amount of people who were threatened with school zone charges," Raybin says. "I can tell you, anecdotally, it goes on all the time."</p>

<p>Rodgerick Griffin ultimately pleaded guilty, caving to the threat of decades behind bars, and received eight years in prison with no possibility of an early release.</p>

<p>"His son will be 19, and Terrance has basically missed every milestone—going to kindergarten, fifth-grade graduation, high school graduation, college move-in day. He's missed so much."</p>

<p>Such deals are the rule, not the exception, in the criminal justice system. More than 97 percent of all federal cases end in plea deals, leaving only a tiny percentage to be disposed of at trial. In some states, an actual trial by a jury of one's peers, as guaranteed by the Constitution, is an endangered species.</p>

<p>McGuire notes that Connecticut's geographic area courts, which handle all misdemeanor and most felony cases in the state, had a total of 74,503 cases in 2016.</p>

<p>"How many of those cases do you think were disposed of at trial?" he asks, pausing for effect.</p>

<p>"103."</p>

<p>'It's Tearing Families Apart'</p>

<p>For a measure meant to protect children, drug-free zones have been awfully destructive for families.</p>

<p>Nashville resident Joi Davis' husband, Terrance, has been incarcerated since 2003 on drug-free school zone charges. Undercover police bought more than 20 grams of cocaine from him one night inside his apartment.</p>

<p>If he'd lived in a unit on the other side of the gated complex, he would have faced 12 years in prison for the drug charges, with the possibility of parole within four, and would likely be a free man today. But his actual residence fell just within a school zone, so he ended up taking a plea deal for 22 years. He had prior drug offenses, but no violent criminal history. It was, in fact, a somewhat generous deal from the prosecutors' perspective, considering the several other charges and maximum sentences they could have pursued against him.</p>

<p>"Boom, there he goes, a decade and a half of his life already gone, all because of a couple hundred feet," Davis, an employee at a charter school, says in a phone interview. "I know for a fact there's people who have committed crimes like second-degree murder and rape, and they have went home, whereas Terrance is sitting there twiddling his thumbs and patiently waiting."</p>

<p>"His son will be 19, and Terrance has basically missed every milestone—going to kindergarten, fifth-grade graduation, high school graduation, college move-in day," the 39-year-old adds. "He's missed so much."</p>

<p>Thanks to a judge's ruling, her husband will be eligible for parole in under a year, after he finishes the mandatory 15-year portion of his sentence. Davis says they have a five-year plan for after he gets out: a truck driving license, maybe their own business, a little log cabin somewhere nice.</p>

<p>Until his release, Davis works and counts the days. Some days she sends out 30 to 40 emails to state lawmakers about the injustice of Tennessee's school zone laws. She talks about turning her one-woman advocacy blitz into a nonprofit organization.</p>

<p>"It's not just affecting my family," she says. "There's plenty of other families out there. Some lawmakers really want change, but the ones voting against it need to see it's wasteful for taxpayers, it's tearing families apart, and it's so unnecessary."</p>

<p>Reform at Last?</p>

<p>Many states, both liberal and conservative, are now reconsidering their drug-free school zone laws, but lawmakers are reluctant to roll back legislation that's supposed to protect children.</p>

<p>In 2008, the Indiana legislature was considering a bill to expand its drug-free zones to include churches and bus stops. A group of freshmen from DePauw University, taking a class on public policy from former political science professor Kelsey Kauffman, testified at a committee hearing and brought along a map they had created showing what the result would look like.</p>

<p>The drug-free zones would have swallowed nearly everything in Indianapolis except the airport. As it stood, state laws already created what the students called overlapping "superzones."</p>

<p>The classmates were the only ones to testify against the proposal. After they revealed the map, the hearing was "absolute pandemonium for the next hour and a half," Kauffman says. The bill passed through the committee by one vote, but it died in the state Senate.</p>

<p>Groups of freshmen from Kauffman's classes continued to bring their maps to the legislature over the next several years, and in 2014, then–Gov. Mike Pence signed a law, over the objections of the state prosecutor association, shrinking Indiana's drug-free zones from 1,000 to 500 feet, reducing the sentences for school zone violations, and removing public housing complexes and youth centers from the designation.</p>

<p>Utah lawmakers passed a bill in 2015 that dramatically altered its drug-free zones, reducing their size from 1,000 feet to 100 feet and limiting their application to between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. around schools, and only during business hours around other locations. Prior to 2015, the zones covered 10 percent of the entire state and made any drug offense except for possession a first degree felony if it occurred near a school, public park, amusement park, arcade, recreation center, church, shopping mall, sports facility, movie theater, playhouse, or parking lot.</p>

<p>Massachusetts lawmakers passed a bill in 2012 that reduced the size of drug-free zones from 1,000 to 300 feet and made them applicable only between 5 a.m. and midnight. Brownsberger said the effect on sentencing and the state prison population was dramatic, dropping the number of school zone–enhanced sentences by two-thirds or more.</p>

<p>"If you looked at the houses of correction populations going back six or eight years ago, you would have seen a lot of people doing school zone sentences," Brownsberger says. "Now, most people who are doing mandatory minimum sentences are there for drunk driving or gun charges. There just aren't a lot of school zone charges being booked."</p>

<p>Many advocacy groups would like to see drug-free school zones eliminated entirely or at least severely limited, but they've had to settle for compromises to assuage more conservative lawmakers. While several states have reduced the number of locations that turn the surrounding area into such a zone and have limited the types of offenses the statutes cover, none have shrunk the perimeter to less than 100 feet.</p>

<p>Harris, the Tennessee lawmaker, says Indiana is a model for his own reform efforts. A bill to reduce the Volunteer State's drug-free zones from 1,000 feet to 500 feet passed the state Senate last year but died in the state House. Legislators are trying again this year, with support from a coalition of conservative and liberal advocacy groups.</p>

<p>"It's an uphill battle in Tennessee," Harris says. "The good news is there are conservative states out there that are taking a look at these laws and making changes, because they're not a good use of resources."</p>

<p>Jim Weber/ZUMA Press/Newscom</p>

<p>In 2008, Calvin Bryant was a 20-year-old student at Tennessee State University. He had been a talented fullback in high school and dreamed of going pro.</p>

<p>Now he's serving 17 years in Tennessee state prison—15 of them mandatory—for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense. His sentence is substantially longer that it normally would have been under the state's drug laws, just because of where he lived.</p>

<p>Police arrested Bryant in 2008 for selling 320 pills, mostly ecstasy, out of his Nashville apartment to a confidential informant who'd been bugging him. Tennessee treats this as a serious offense under any circumstances: Normally he would have faced at least two and a half years in prison. But because Bryant lived in a housing project within 1,000 feet of an elementary school—roughly three city blocks—his sentence was automatically enhanced under Tennessee's drug-free school zone laws to the same category as rape or second-degree murder.</p>

<p>Indeed, as someone with no prior adult criminal record, Bryant would have been eligible for release earlier if he'd committed one of those violent felonies.</p>

<p>Bryant's case is now the subject of a legal challenge filed by the Tennessee attorney Daniel Horwitz. Horwitz will go before a state judge tomorrow to argue that the arbitrary and excessive nature of Bryant's sentence violates his rights under the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishments.</p>

<p>It's also a case study in how police and prosecutors use drug-free school zones, which exist in all 50 states and are supposed to protect schoolchildren from drug pushers, to threaten drug offenders with huge sentences whether or not they were dealing to a minor and whether or not school was even in session at the time.</p>

<p>"There is no circumstance in which it makes sense to punish a first-time, nonviolent drug offender more harshly than a rapist or a murderer," Horwitz tells Reason. "Mr. Bryant has more than paid his debt to society, and as everyone who is familiar with his case has recognized, he deserves to be released."</p>

<p>That's not just the opinion of a bleeding-heart criminal defense lawyer. The prosecutor who put Bryant in prison, Robert McGuire, submitted an affidavit to the court along with Horwitz's petition.</p>

<p>"I fail to see how an additional six years of incarceration will improve Mr. Bryant's amenability to correction or would be required to maintain public safety," McGuire writes. "I additionally fail to see how his release at a time earlier than 2023—and after over nine years of incarceration—will deprecate the seriousness of the offenses for which he was convicted or significantly imperil public safety."</p>

<p>The 12 members of Nashville's city council have also signed a letter in support of Bryant's petition for sentencing relief.</p>

<p>Civil liberties and criminal justice advocates have long argued that the large radius of these zones create overlapping "superzones" that blanket urban areas, especially poor and minority neighborhoods. Because Tennessee's drug-free zones include day cares, libraries, and parks, it's almost impossible to escape them in some neighborhoods. And getting caught with drugs in a zone mean the difference between being eligible for probation and serving years of hard time.</p>

<p>If Bryant "had lived in a wealthy, residentially-zoned suburb like Belle Meade, then he likely would have been eligible for release after serving just two years and five months in prison for the exact same conduct," Bryant's petition states. "Because Mr. Bryant lived in the Edgehill Housing Projects, however, Mr. Bryant must serve a mandatory minimum sentence of at least 15 years before he even becomes eligible for parole."</p>

<p>Here's what the Edgehill neighborhood of Nashville that Bryant lived in looks like. The tan areas are those covered by drug-free zones:</p>

<p>Tennessee Bureau of Investigation</p>

<p>That's why Nashville's current district attorney, Glenn Funk, doesn't pursue drug-free school zone sentences against defendants who haven't violated the core purpose of the law: putting children in danger.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, members of the Tennessee state legislature plan to advance a bill in the upcoming session to shrink the state's drug-free school zones from 1,000 feet to 500 feet. A similar effort failed in the state House last year.</p>

<p>But that's cold comfort for current inmates and their families.</p>

<p>"Calvin has been incarcerated since May 16, 2008 and it has affected our family in a major way," Bryant's sister LaShana writes in a letter attached to his petition. "Our father passed away 11 months after he was incarcerated, and our mother had developed several health issues. Calvin is not perfect, but he is a great man that has definitely grown and matured over the years. I pray that he is allowed a second chance to be released so that our family will be able to put this behind us and move forward."</p>

<p>You can read about all this and more in an investigation into drug-free school zone laws by myself and my colleague Lauren Krisai in the latest print edition of Reason. We obtained public records showing wide racial disparities in drug-free school zone sentences in Tennessee. We also got our hands on geographic information system (GIS) data showing that wide swaths of urban areas in the state are covered by these overlapping zones. In fact, 27 percent of Nashville, where Bryant was arrested, is covered in drug-free school zones.</p>

<h2 id="georgialawmakerintroducesbilltorequireconvictionforassetforfeiture">Georgia Lawmaker Introduces Bill To Require Conviction for Asset Forfeiture</h2>

<p>by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-12</p>

<p>url: http://reason.com/blog/2017/12/12/georgia-lawmaker-introduces-bill-to-requ </p>

<p>Robin Rayne Nelson/ZUMA Press/Newscom</p>

<p>After years of work and compromise, Georgia passed modest asset forfeiture reforms in 2015 that strengthened protections for property owners and required law enforcement to release standardized annual reports on their asset forfeiture activity.</p>

<p>Republican state representative Scot Turner believe those reforms didn't go far enough. Turner introduced a bill, H.B. 505, in February that would require law enforcement in Georgia to obtain a criminal conviction for the state to keep seized assets.</p>

<p>If Turner's bill becomes law the state would join 14 others requiring a criminal conviction in some or all asset forfeiture cases. Nebraska, New Mexico, and North Carolina have abolished civil asset forfeiture altogether.</p>

<p>Under civil asset forfeiture laws in other states, police can seize property they believe is connected to criminal activity, even if the owners are not charged with a crime.</p>

<p>Law enforcement groups say asset forfeiture is a vital tool to disrupt drug trafficking and other organized crime by targeting their illicit gains. Police seize millions of dollars and tons of narcotics during highway traffic stops every year.</p>

<p>However, civil liberties groups from across the political spectrum say innocent property owners are victims of lax safeguards, poor transparency, and the perverse profit incentives of asset forfeiture without ever being charged, much less convicted, of a crime.</p>

<p>"If my bill becomes law, [police] will still have that tool in the toolbox," Turner, who represents a suburb to the north of Atlanta, tells Reason. "It's just that they can't immediately start using the money. They have to go through criminal proceedings first. That restores the concept of innocent until proven guilty. I mean, that's a fundamental American promise, that you have rights that are intrinsic to you by your very nature as a human being. We recognize that as a country. That's an American promise. We break that promise when we engage in this type of activity."</p>

<p>Jason Pye, vice president of legislative affairs at the limited-government advocacy group FreedomWorks, says Turner's bill "restores due process and protects innocent individuals whose property may be seized by requiring a criminal conviction."</p>

<p>"Georgia took a step in the right direction a couple of years ago with the passage of HB 233," Pye says. "Still, that law is lacking in protections. Property can still be permanently seized by law enforcement based on a low evidentiary standard, without ever arresting, charging or convicting the owner of a crime. As someone who works on this issue, this is standard law enforcement should have to meet. As a Georgian, it's time for my state to get on the right side of the issue."</p>

<p>Even with bipartisan support, Turner says getting his law passed will still be a heavy lift. Law enforcement groups like the Georgia Sheriffs Association, whose membership can make or break local politicians, have opposed restrictions on asset forfeiture. Turner vividly remembers watching sheriffs from around Georgia file into the statehouse visitors gallery to watch the legislature debate the 2015 bill.</p>

<p>The Georgia Sheriffs Association was not immediately available for comment.</p>

<p>Legislators may not be thrilled to take up the issue again. But it was law enforcement opposition to reform that Turner says got him fired up about the issue in the first place.</p>

<p>A 2013 Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation highlighted the case of Alda Gentile, a New York grandmother who was driving to Florida with her son and one-year-old grandson. She had roughly $11,000 in cash in the car, money she said she had saved for a down payment on a condo. After she was pulled over for speeding, Georgia police seized every cent of Gentile's money, even though no drugs were found.</p>

<p>Turner also cited the case of former Atlanta Hawks basketball player Mike Scott. In 2015, Banks County Sheriff's deputy Brent Register pulled over Scott for allegedly speeding. A search of Scott's car turned up marijuana, ecstasy and more than $1,000 in cash, which Register seized under asset forfeiture laws.</p>

<p>Using public records, Scott's attorneys showed Register's reasons for pulling over Scott were impossible to square with the facts. Records showed Register had made 1,400 traffic stops in 2015 and 2016, but only issued eight traffic tickets. All but three of the 47 people Register arrested were black in a county that is 90 percent white.</p>

<p>A judge ruled Register had racially profiled Scott and declared the evidence against him inadmissible in court. Prosecutors dropped the charges against Scott, and the Combs County Sheriff's Department fired Register shortly after.</p>

<p>"He was targeting, frankly," Turner says, "because he thought these were people who might have some cash on them that they could seize, and it was such a small amount that they wouldn't have the means to protect themselves."</p>

<p>But the only reason Register got caught was because he accidentally pulled over someone who could afford a good lawyer.</p>

<p>How many other tainted traffic stops and seizures went unchallenged, Turner wonders: "They uncovered what should have been a giant scandal."</p>
