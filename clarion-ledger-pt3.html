<h2 id="jessicachamberscasedefenseaccusesdistrictattorneyofmisconductwitnesstampering">Jessica Chambers case: Defense accuses district attorney of misconduct, witness tampering</h2>

<p>Minutes after the jury hopelessly deadlocked in the week-long trial of Quinton Verdell Tellis in the 2014 burning death of Jessica Chambers, DA John Champion said he will be retried. Therese Apel/ The Clarion-Ledger</p>

<p>The defense attorney in the Jessica Chambers murder trial is accusing the district attorney prosecuting the case of misconduct related to witness tampering.</p>

<p>Darla Palmer, the attorney for Quinton Tellis, claims District Attorney John Champion attempted to sway a witness to testify that Chambers would often refer to Tellis as "Eric," according to a motion and affidavit filed Monday.</p>

<p>Tellis was charged with capital murder in the 2014 burning death of 19-year-old Chambers, who was found engulfed in flames on a road in Courtland on Dec. 4, 2016. When asked who had set her on fire, Chambers appeared to say "Eric," according to testimony from multiple first responders at Tellis' October trial.</p>

<p>In the motion, Palmer alleges that Champion tried to pressure Jalen Asir Matthews Caudle to testify that Chambers used to refer to Tellis as "Eric," the Oxygen network first reported.</p>

<p>Palmer also represents Caudle, who is charged with capital murder in an unrelated case.</p>

<p>Palmer could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</p>

<p>Champion declined to comment when reached Tuesday afternoon, citing the pending trial.</p>

<p>The October trial ended with a hung jury. Because of worries that Tellis — a black man eight years older than the white, teenaged Chambers — would not receive a fair trial amid all the publicity surrounding the case, the jury was selected more than 200 miles south in Pike County.</p>

<p>A woman is in custody after a traffic stop yielded methamphetamine, the Rankin County Sheriff's Department said.</p>

<p>Around 3 p.m. on Monday, the Rankin County Interstate Interdiction Task Force stopped the driver of a Ford pickup on Interstate 20 in Rankin County for a traffic violation. During the traffic stop the deputy suspected the vehicle was transporting drugs and/or contraband, according to a news release. The driver consented to a search of the vehicle, and over nine pounds of methamphetamine was found.</p>

<p>The driver, Tayset Lucero, was charged with trafficking methamphetamine.</p>

<p>District Attorney Michael Guest was to bring Lucero before Rankin County Court Judge Kent McDaniel for an initial appearance. As of Monday, no bond had been set.</p>

<p>A report revealed disciplinary action cases that are supposed to be put on record, were not properly recorded in some cases.</p>

<p>Mississippi gave this charter $2 million last year. Officials believe that it's exempt from the transparency required of traditional public schools.</p>

<p>(Photo: File photo/The Clarion-Ledger)</p>

<p>Officials with a Jackson charter school are refusing to disclose employee emails in the wake of a lawsuit alleging that a worker dragged a special-needs student by his shirt collar.</p>

<p>The state Legislature appropriated more than $2 million to the charter for the 2018 fiscal year. But charter officials argue that it's exempt from the transparency required of traditional public schools.</p>

<p>The lawsuit brought by Lawanda Barnes, the mother of a child enrolled in Reimagine Prep, accuses school officials of failing to keep her son safe</p>

<p>The complaint filed in Hinds County last November, accuses an employee of mistreating the child diagnosed with a learning disability.</p>

<p>At the time of the allegations, which date back to August 30, 2016, the employee worked as a teacher at Reimagine Prep. The school is a part of the Nashville-based Republic Schools network which operates three charter schools in Jackson and is seeking to open a fourth.</p>

<p>The complaint says the incident occurred in the Reimagine Prep gym where Barnes’ son was lying down on the floor.</p>

<p>More: Are schools underreporting abuse by teachers? MDE says no, but these cases raise questions</p>

<p>The lawsuit states that the child was experiencing a migraine when an employee “grabbed him by his shirt collar and proceeded to drag him across the floor all the way from the gym to the cafeteria, where she slung him up against a wall.”</p>

<p>In a response, lawyers for the school said a teacher disciplined the student “in good faith” by “removing him from the school gym and placing him into the cafeteria.”</p>

<p>The response did not indicate whether the removal involved the employee physically restraining the student.</p>

<p>Barnes declined to speak on record for this story. Kelly Williams with Sellers and Associates law firm, which is representing Barnes, said the firm does not comment on pending litigation.</p>

<p>In May, the Clarion Ledger requested all emails sent to and from the email account of Reimagine Prep Principal Christina McDonald for the month of September 2016. The newspaper also asked for emails from the network’s servers pertaining to an employee who is no longer with Reimagine Prep for the same time period.</p>

<p>Although charter schools operate independently of their home school district, they are public schools and are subject to the state’s Public Records Act.</p>

<p>Under the act, any document prepared, maintained or used by any governmental body must be made available to the public unless it falls under a certain exemption.</p>

<p>Opponents of charter schools have long argued that certain rule waivers for charter schools provide an unfair advantage. And Republic's claims of exceptions to the state's Public Records Act highlights the underlying tension between charter schools and traditional public schools advocates.</p>

<p>In a decision involving the Rankin County School District, the state Ethics Commission issued guidance that any electronic records produced by a teacher “concerning any business, transaction, work, duty or function of the school district are, without doubt, public records.”</p>

<p>Republic argues that only documents produced by its governing board, are subject to disclosure.</p>

<p>"If e-mails were sent to or from our public body—our governing board of directors—that related to your records request, RePublic would produce them," Abigail Rockey, director of network operations for Republic, said in an email denying the request. "Because RePublic’s board does not possess such materials, we have nothing to provide."</p>

<p>The Clarion Ledger filed an ethics complaint Monday challenging Republic’s reasons for withholding the emails.</p>

<p>Any ruling issued by the state Ethics Commission on the matter could set a precedent for public transparency of charter schools.</p>

<p>A Jones County man was admitted to the hospital with minor injuries after fleeing police who ended up shooting at him.</p>

<p>Laurel Police Department issued a release Wednesday — though the incident happened Friday morning at 2:22 a.m. — that stated that Jerry Jerome Patterson, 58, was allegedly driving a white truck when police attempted to pull him over.</p>

<p>Authorities said Patterson fled from patrol units, traveling from Ellisville Boulevard, Industrial and Indian Springs roads and into the West Jones area. Patterson ran off into a ditch around Lonesome Pines Road.</p>

<p>Officers were getting out of their cars to take Patterson into custody when the release states that he angled his vehicle towards one of them. As Patterson allegedly drove toward one of the officers, the other one fired three shots at the tires of his vehicle, disabling a rear tire.</p>

<p>Patterson then turned his car away from the officer and ran again, but only made it a short distance before police were able to apprehend him.</p>

<p>Patterson was taken into custody without further incident, police said. He was transported to a local hospital for minor injuries sustained in the accident, was released and has been booked into the Jones County Jail.</p>

<p>Patterson faces one county of felony fleeing and one count of attempted aggravated assault on an officer. Patterson had his initial appearance in Laurel Municipal Court this morning where his bond was set at $10,000 and $25,000 each.</p>

<p>The incident is undergoing an internal review at Laurel Police Department. Any persons with information about this or any other case are encouraged to call LPD at 601-399-4440 or Crime Stoppers at 601-428-STOP.</p>

<p>As the sun started to set, a Lincoln Towncar carrying two women pulled into a parking spot at the Star Motel on Medgar Evers Boulevard in Jackson.</p>

<p>As it rolled to a stop, Jackson Police Department narcotics Detective Tarik Williams radioed to fellow officers, "Two white females."</p>

<p>"10-4. I think that's gonna be them," radioed back Hinds County Sheriff's Department narcotics Detective Nick Brown. "The passenger should be getting out to get the room."</p>

<p>The 19-year-old woman who called herself "Jezebel" had allegedly been talking to Brown after they connected on AdultLook.com, an escorting website that has gained traction since federal officials shut down the the popular classified ad website Backpage.</p>

<p>Brown had negotiated to meet her.</p>

<p>Throughout the day, the conversation went on. Among other questions, "Jezebel" asked Brown if he were affiliated with law enforcement. She might not have known that if you ask a police officer if he's a police officer, he isn't bound by law to say yes.</p>

<p>"That's not true, but people think it is because they watch a lot of TV," Brown said.</p>

<p>She sent photos of herself, and he sent her a picture of his face. Brown asked if "Jezebel" could bring a friend, and she sent photos of a blonde. The cost would be $260 for one, $500 for the both of them, she said. She assured him the two would be there to meet him.</p>

<p>They were.</p>

<p>As Hinds County narcotics deputies and officers from the Jackson Police Department Gun Crimes Unit cornered "Jezebel" in the motel room, other detectives confronted her friend at the car.</p>

<p>Police had pulled the only trick that night.</p>

<p>The hook</p>

<p>When people use escort websites and apps to solicit clients, there is a certain vague, tricky language they use to try to disarm police or prosecutors. Unfortunately, police know the language.</p>

<p>"I always start out with 'hey,'" Brown said.</p>

<p>"Jezebel" replied by asking his race, age and location. She asked him how much time he wanted to spend with her, and when he told her, "At least an hour," she told him it would be "260 roses."</p>

<p>"Roses" is the code for money, Brown said. In following texts, "Jezebel" repeated that the "donations" were for "time and company, not prostitution."</p>

<p>"The ad is very explicit for what she's offering for money," Brown said.</p>

<p>Jezebel's ad describes her, among random emojis, as, "Sexy fun thick snow bunny, no cops no bs, Min 140 and up, no low ballers, NO BLACK MEN UNDER 45." The ad has what is allegedly her phone number, her email address, and what she charges per hour for in-call and out-call services.</p>

<p>Brown was set to meet Jezebel and her friend at one motel, but a traffic stop at the opening of the hotel driveway spooked them and sent them to another motel.</p>

<p>"Jezebel" chose the Star Motel on Medgar Evers Drive, where at least some customers don't get a room key, Brown said. Instead, they are let in by a motel employee, and when their hour is up, someone knocks on the door and tells them it's time to get out.</p>

<p>"In the phone call she assured me she wasn’t the police and that her friend would be with her and that they could be there in seven minutes. She told me that she was in room 102 and we watched them come in," Brown said.</p>

<p>That's when officers made their move.</p>

<p>Their stories</p>

<p>"Jezebel" is allegedly the working name of Alexis Johnston, a brunette who some may say looks much like the girl next door. She sat almost defiantly on the bed in room 102, seemingly unfazed by the fact she was probably looking at a stay in the jail. Her petite friend Angie Smith stood by the car with her hands over her face and tried to convince police she wasn't involved in the deal Johnston had allegedly made with them.</p>

<p>As the women talked separately to police, pictures of their lives emerged. Smith, older than Johnston by just a few years, was a little more tight-lipped, but "Jezebel" opened up.</p>

<p>Johnston, 19, told Brown she'd only been doing sex work for about seven months. She said she had lived in a homeless shelter in Louisiana where she learned she could make good money turning tricks.</p>

<p>The people who ran the homeless shelter knew she had been hooking, she said. They assigned her to a human trafficking case manager, but she said she'd never been trafficked.</p>

<p>"You could tell by talking to her she hadn’t experienced the extreme side of it, getting into trafficking and stuff like that," Brown said.</p>

<p>She was so flippant in answering Brown's questions that he wasn't sure if she actually knew who she was talking to. When he had Mirandized her, he asked her what she was doing there.</p>

<p>"I was here to see a client," she said. "To do what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To spend time with them. Quality time with them." She drew out the word "quality" as if to allude to what it seemed she really meant.</p>

<p>"Meaning?" Brown asked.</p>

<p>"Meaning hanging out with them," Johnston replied.</p>

<p>"You didn’t make any other arrangements, no nothing?" Brown said, to which she responded, "Mmm, not that I know of."</p>

<p>Brown asked her where her client was, to which she answered, almost exasperatedly, "I’m looking at him."</p>

<p>"Thank you. So you know what you agreed to," Brown said. "I just wanted to make sure you understand who you’re talking to."</p>

<p>JPD Detectives Anthony Fox (right) and Tarik Williams talk to Angie Smith after she was arrested on charges of promoting prostitution.</p>

<p>'To not do this anymore'</p>

<p>While Johnston was cool and unshaken, Smith was visibly nervous. Williams asked her where she came from, to which she responded that she was from Louisiana, but she had grown up in Texas.</p>

<p>"I just moved here, me and my husband. I live here and I have a house," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, you had a hotel room, so," Williams said.</p>

<p>JPD Detective Anthony Fox asked her if she had ever been arrested before, she said she had, for "working."</p>

<p>"So you're telling me you're out here working," Fox said. She told him, "I’m here because of her… This is her call, this has nothing to do with me."</p>

<p>The smell of marijuana was coming strong from the car the women had driven, and Fox pointed it out. He told her officers were going to search the car, and she quickly told him, "It's not my car. It's my husband's car."</p>

<p>"Well, we're still going to search it," he said.</p>

<p>Officers found Smith's probation card from Texas. She had two months left on probation after a prostitution conviction. Putting her face in her hands, she whimpered, seemingly tearlessly, as officers talked to her.</p>

<p>She explained that she didn't want to go back, but she didn't have the paperwork to be allowed to cross state lines. She had been driving back to Texas to meet with her probation officer.</p>

<p>Smith said she had been homeless in Houston, where she had met her husband, who is from Jackson, and she had come back to Mississippi with him.</p>

<p>"Where’s he?" Brown asked her.</p>

<p>"Probably at home wondering where I’m at," Smith replied.</p>

<p>"Does he know what you’re out here doing?" Brown asked. After a pause, Smith told him, "Probably not."</p>

<p>"So you moved here…" Brown began. "...to not do this anymore," she finished for him.</p>

<p>'It only takes one chance'</p>

<p>Inside the motel room, Fox and JPD Sgt. Barry Hale continued talking with Johnston while JPD Officer Cossandra Feltson looked through her purse for ID, among other things.</p>

<p>"Let me ask you this. Do you care for or value your life?" Fox asked Johnston.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, I actually have a lot that I want to do..." she said.</p>

<p>"You’ve got a lot going for yourself. Does this include…?" he motioned around the motel room with his hand and she shook her head.</p>

<p>"You’re not exactly on a high-end escort site doing this. The path you’re going down, doing this will not end well for you," Hale said. "You haven’t met the one who beats the s--- out of you and puts a knife to you and threatens to kill you."</p>

<p>Johnston said she'd never been raped before, but she had been "close to it." She gets tested for diseases every three months, she said. Fox told her testing doesn't keep you from getting diseases, and that any day could be the day a condom broke or someone with an STD assaulted her.</p>

<p>"It's a risk," she said, to which Fox asked, "That you're willing to take?"</p>

<p>"Obviously, because I'm doing it, right?" Johnston replied.</p>

<p>Brown said police were concerned that her flippant attitude towards the dangers of prostitution indicated not that she was necessarily street-hard, but that she just hadn't seen how bad it can be.</p>

<p>"You could tell she was most definitely heading that direction because of her attitude towards it, she just didn’t care," Brown said. "We asked if she’d been assaulted, she didn’t care. She actually didn’t care about much, so we called out the human traffic coordinator, and I told them they need to talk some sense into her because she’s headed down a road where she’s possibly going to get hurt or killed."</p>

<p>Fox told her that very thing.</p>

<p>"Doing this is stupid. I understand it only takes one chance, I understand I could get my head blown off. I understand all that," Johnston said. "I’m not going to do this forever. I just filed my taxes. I'm a normal person."</p>

<p>"You're not doing normal things. It doesn't matter," Fox told her. "Why take that risk? Why? You could go get a 9-5. Instead of this. We see this all day long, every day, where it doesn’t turn out for you. ...Nothing good can come out of what you’re doing, I promise you. We see it all the time. Somebody’s been beaten until we can’t recognize who they are."</p>

<p>Brown also told her that her lack of knowledge of the area she was in was dangerous. He asked her if she knew where she was, and she replied, "Getting arrested." He pressed her for where she was geographically, and she responded, "Jackson, Mississippi. The murder rate is like 37 for the week."</p>

<p>"This ain’t Mayberry. You’re in one of the worst spots in Jackson," Brown told her.</p>

<p>Promoting prostitution</p>

<p>Both women were arrested that night, and charged with promotion of prostitution.</p>

<p>Brown explained to Johnston that the charge is a felony. Among other things, she had allegedly offered Smith up as a third in an anticipated threesome. Smith caught the charge because she allegedly helped facilitate the crime by driving Johnston to the motel.</p>

<p>An investigative team from American Public Media has uncovered evidence that law enforcement had at least two other suspects in the 1996 quadruple homicide in Winona that put Curtis Flowers on death row — information that was not shared with his defense attorneys.</p>

<p>And that omission, a law professor and former prosecutor told the team, could mean a seventh new trial for Flowers, condemined to death for the murders of four people at Tardy Furniture Store.</p>

<p>The suspects include the gunman in an Alabama crime spree that summer that bore several similarities to the Winona killings and a violent career criminal who at the time of the murders was living with a girlfriend across from the furniture store.</p>

<p>APM Reports, the investigative and documentary reporting team based in St. Paul, Minnesota, spent a year digging into the Flowers case for its “In the Dark” podcast.</p>

<p>Doug Evans, the district attorney who prosecuted Flowers in all six trials, has declined to be interviewed by APM Reports and has not returned calls from the Clarion Ledger.</p>

<p>Racial discrimination in jury selection</p>

<p>Evans has spoken to the Greenwood Commonwealth, most recently about APM Reports analysis of his record of striking potential black jurors vs. white juries — 4 1/2 times more often. He told the Commonwealth, “I think these (APM Reports) folks are just coming up with anything they can to discredit the case. … I’ve had many trials where no black jurors were struck.”</p>

<p>But the Mississippi Supreme Court overturned Flowers’ conviction in his third trial, ruling Evans had intentionally struck African Americans from the jury. The justices wrote that it was “as strong a prima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge."</p>

<p>If Evans and his prosecution witnesses knowingly or unknowingly withheld evidence from the defense of other suspects in the Winona killings, they could be in violation of the Brady rule, named after a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says a criminal defendant must be given evidence that could point toward his innocence. In that 1963 ruling, the court said: "The suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment."</p>

<p>Since police, sheriff's deputies, jailers and highway patrol investigators work for the state, if they turn up anything that casts doubt on the defendant's guilt, the prosecutor must hand it over to the defense.</p>

<p>Did the DA, law enforcement lie to the judge?</p>

<p>In the Flowers case, Evans and investigators asserted that Flowers was the main suspect from the beginning, including up to his sixth and, so far, final trial.</p>

<p>Judge Joseph Loper asked Evans if the state had any “exculpatory evidence.”</p>

<p>"We have never had any evidence that showed anything other than this defendant's guilt," Evans said.</p>

<p>Evidence of false testimony by prosecution witnesses could potentially get Flowers' conviction overturned, Bennett Gershman, a former prosecutor who now teaches law at Pace University, told the APM reporting team.</p>

<p>And the investigative file not shared with the defense showed investigators had considered Marcus Presley, the gunman in the murders and a string of similar crimes that same summer in neighboring Alabama.</p>

<p>In October 2015, some 20 years after the murders, Katie Ali, one of Flowers’ attorneys in his appeal, recognized him in the photo lineup law enforcement used to implicate Flowers: In those Alabama crimes, store employees were shot execution-style with a .380 handgun — the same type weapon used in the Tardy Furniture Store killings — that might have jammed, and a suspect was wearing Fila shoes — the same type shoe found from a bloody shoe print at the scene. In 1996, Mississippi investigators told the local paper they were looking into a possible connection.</p>

<p>But the investigative file turned over to Flowers’ defense attorneys didn’t mention the possible link. Prosecutors said repeatedly at trial that the only suspect seriously investigated was Flowers.</p>

<p>Law enforcement witnesses had testified under oath in Flowers’ sixth trial that Presley was never a suspect.</p>

<p>Presley wasn’t the only suspect defense attorneys didn’t know investigators had seriously considered.</p>

<p>Shoes led to third suspect in crime</p>

<p>APM lead investigative reporter Madeleine Baran found one page among the documents Evans did give the defense attorneys, a form someone named Willie James Hemphill, then 24, of Memphis had signed at the Winona Police Department five days after the murders waiving his rights to an attorney.</p>

<p>The only other such form in the file was signed by Flowers.</p>

<p>Hemphill’s name came up briefly in Flowers’ 2010 trial. John Johnson, the DA’s investigator, told the jury, “I think they talked to him for five minutes. I don’t think they learned anything.”</p>

<p>State investigator Jack Matthews, one of those who had read Hemphill his rights, said he’d only talked to Hemphill for a “short time” before realizing he didn’t know anything.</p>

<p>There were no notes from that interview.</p>

<p>Baran found Hemphill’s booking card showing he had been arrested and jailed a few days after the killing. And in searching for Hemphill, she came upon a cousin with the same name who recalled three carloads of deputies showing up at his mobile home in 1996 looking for the other Hemphill.</p>

<p>When Baran and her producer eventually tracked down the right Hemphill, he told them, “Yeah, they actually had me as a suspect in that.”</p>

<p>He told them that a day or two after the murders he was driving back to Winona from Memphis when his stepfather called him and told him carloads of law enforcement officers had descending on his parents’ house looking for him.</p>

<p>“My mom, my stepdad were afraid that, hey, if they're manhunting me like that, they may shoot me down in the street,” Hemphill told them.</p>

<p>When he showed up the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department two days later, he said, they immediately cuffed him and that the investigators made it clear he was a suspect. They didn’t question him about other suspects or bring up Flowers’ name. He said he told investigators he was shopping with a woman in Memphis. State investigator Matthews told the jury he didn’t check Hemphill’s alibi, ruling him out by conversation alone.</p>

<p>Hemphill said investigators told him he was a suspect because witnesses had placed him on Front Street near Tardy Furniture Store on the morning of the murders and because of the kind of shoe he wore: Fila Grant Hills, the shoe investigators determined had made the bloody shoe prints inside the store. Hemphill said he was wearing his Filas when in walked into the Sheriff’s Department. Hemphill said investigator took his shoes for a few minutes as well as his fingerprints.</p>

<p>Where are Flowers' shoes?</p>

<p>Jurors at Flowers’ trials had only heard of one suspect who could have worn Fila Grant Hills — Flowers — although investigators never found the shoes they said he wore.</p>

<p>Hemphill said investigators tape recorded the interrogation and took notes, none of which was in the file given to Flowers’ defense attorneys. Nor was there any record of the evidence gathered from Hemphill.</p>

<p>Hemphill also wasn’t held briefly. Information APM Reports obtained from the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department through a public records request shows Hemphill was held for 11 days in jail.</p>

<p>Baran said she reached out to the two state investigators who questioned Hemphill, Matthews and Wayne Miller. Matthews never responded. Miller would not comment.</p>

<h2 id="howtosendalettertoachildseparatedfromtheirfamilyattheborder">How to send a letter to a child separated from their family at the border</h2>

<p>by: Sarah Fowler</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p>url: https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2018/06/28/how-help-kids-border-separated-familes/739395002/ </p>

<p>A judge in California on Tuesday ordered U.S. border authorities to reunite separated families within 30 days, setting a hard deadline in a process that has so far yielded uncertainty about when children might again see their parents. Time</p>

<p>Since May, more than 2,000 children have been taken from their parents and family members at the U.S./Mexico border. Protests and rallies have sprung up around the country as people have decried the issue. While a limited few have traveled to the border, many Americans are searching for ways to help. One local law firm is hoping to give people an opportunity to make a direct impact in the life of a child.</p>

<p>Jeremy Litton, associate attorney at Elmore Peterson in Jackson, is organizing a card drive to send to children who have been separated from their families.</p>

<p>Litton said he got the idea last week when he and his wife, Nicole, were talking to their seven-year-old son, Tommy.</p>

<p>The couple was explaining the situation on the border and that children are being kept in makeshift detention centers while their parents await their fate. Tommy sat "shocked" for a moment and then asked his dad if the children could all go to the White House and meet the president in an attempt to change his mind.</p>

<p>"That would be a powerful image, for sure," Litton said, but he told his son they would come up with a way to help these children directly.</p>

<p>The "Act, Write" campaign was born.</p>

<p>The family decided that Tommy would write letters to children at the border. But, fearing many of them wouldn't understand the cards written in English, Litton talked to the partners at his law firm about translating the cards into Spanish. Focusing primarily on immigration, a number of people at the firm speak Spanish.</p>

<p>Together, they decided to ask other kids they know to write letters to children and send them to Elmore Peterson. The firm would then translate the letter and mail both the original letter and the translation to an organization in charge of managing the facilities where the children are being held.</p>

<p>Litton said he's spoken to the people at Southwest Key, the organization that manages the facilities, and has a letter of support for the campaign. He's been assured, he said, that the letters will get to the children.</p>

<p>What our officials are saying on border crisis, locking up children, separating families</p>

<p>Litton said they understand well-meaning adults may want to send letters as well but he's hoping for letters from children because there is a "purity" to children.</p>

<p>"Kids, when they see other kids of different races or ethnicities, that doesn't really enter into the equation for them," he said. "They just see someone and start playing. We as adults are the ones who draw the line. I kind of want to keep it kid between kid."</p>

<p>He's hoping seeing a letter in another child's handwriting will help offer some form of comfort to the children who are without their parents, in a foreign country and far away from home.</p>

<p>"It's important that kids be able to see a handwritten letter...so the kids can have something to show that other kids care about them, that they're important, that they're people too and everybody in the U.S. is not necessarily OK with what's happening."</p>

<p>Litton has asked people to have the letters at Elmore Peterson by July 10 so they can begin transcribing and send them off within a week but anticipates mailing multiple shipments.</p>

<p>"My hope is that we get overwhelmed with responses," he said.</p>

<p>Those interested in sending letters can mail them to:</p>

<h2 id="mississippigroupswilljoinanationalprotestoftrumpsborderpolicy">Mississippi groups will join a national protest of Trump's border policy</h2>

<p>by: Sarah Fowler</p>

<p>Dozens of teachers traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border hoping to deliver supplies and toys to immigrant children in custody. Homeland Security turned them down because they would have to screened and likely discarded. (June 26) AP</p>

<p>Several Mississippi groups have joined the national movement declaring "Families Belong Together." A rally will be held Saturday at 11 a.m. in front of the Governor's mansion.</p>

<p>The rally is in response to the current situation at the border with children being separated from their parents as they attempt to come into America without documentation, including those seeking asylum.</p>

<p>Under a new "zero tolerance" policy implemented in late April by the Trump administration, thousands of children were separated from family members and sent to makeshift detention centers where they were housed in tent cities or flown to foster care facilities or shelters in various parts of the country.</p>

<p>Since early May, 2,342 children have been separated from their parents after illegally crossing the Southern U.S. border, according to the latest numbers from the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>Public outcry was swift. President Donald Trump signed an executive order reversing the policy of separating children, replacing it with a policy to detain entire families including children, together. The executive order ignored the legal time limits on how long a child could be detained.</p>

<p>In a weekend release, the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services said 2,053 children were still in the custody of HHS and awaiting being returned to their parents, CNN reported.</p>

<p>Saturday's rally was planned before the executive order was signed but organizers said they're still protesting to draw attention to the issue. It was organized by local groups Organizing For Action, the Mississippi chapter of Pantsuit Nation, Indivisible Jackson Metro and the ACLU of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Talamieka Brice, with the Mississippi Chapter of Pantsuit Nation, said she and others decided to come together as a diverse showing of solidarity.</p>

<p>"We'll be a diverse group of people, that's what makes up Mississippi," she said. "When you pull back, Democrat, Eepublican, Christian, Muslim, all people with a heartbeat, we move to the same rhythm.</p>

<p>"Immigrants have been a huge part of the fabric of this nation. We've seen what happens when countries turn into regimes. We just want to do everything we can to keep families together and go on record saying this is wrong."</p>

<p>Alvin Barnes, with Organizing for Action, traveled to an ICE office in Dallas last weekend. He needed to see it for himself, he said.</p>

<p>Barnes, of Jackson, said he felt a "range of emotions" while at the office but largely felt anger at officials and sympathy for the families.</p>

<p>"I'm marching because I'm sympathetic and I stand in solidity with the families now being separated," he said. "I feel that it's a policy that shouldn't be in effect, should never have been in effect and shouldn't have ever been considered."</p>

<p>Barnes noted that despite the executive order, families are still separated, scattered across the country.</p>

<p>"I'm going to fight against it every step of the way because I don't feel like it should have been implemented," he said.</p>

<p>Originally from Duck Hill, Brice grew up with her grandmother recounting the lynchings of Roosevelt Townes and Robert "Bootjack" McDaniels. The two black men were accused of shooting and killing a white store owner in Duck Hill in 1937. The men were chained to trees, burned with blow torches, shot and set on fire.</p>

<p>"I remember my grandmother telling the story of Bootjack McDaniels being in the woods and hearing him scream and cry," she said. "As a kid, 4 or 5 years old, that always bothered me and I didn't understand why she wouldn't go and let him out."</p>

<p>As an adult, Brice said she now understands her grandmother's position. But she's choosing to participate in Saturday's rally so, years from now, her children know where she stood on the issue.</p>

<p>My children are going to look back in history and say, 'Mom, what were you doing in those dark and ugly times?'</p>

<p>"All the billions of things we all have going on, we want to take time to make sure our voice is heard and say 'This is wrong and history remembers it' and do our best to change the tide."</p>

<h2 id="nomorepenaltiesforvagrantsandtrampssundaypossiblepenaltyforleftlanedriving">No more penalties for 'vagrants' and 'tramps' Sunday; possible penalty for left lane driving</h2>

<p>Here are some of the most colorful quotes heard at the Mississippi Capitol this week. Dustin Barnes and Geoff Pender</p>

<p>No more "vagrants" and "tramps" penalties will be in Mississippi law comes Sunday, but motorists could face a penalty for driving in the left lane on a multi-lane roadway for an extended period.</p>

<p>Those are among the new laws passed by the Mississippi Legislature this year that take effect July 1.</p>

<p>The vagrants and tramps legislation removes penalties from archaic Mississippi laws, which refer to the homeless as "vagrants" and "tramps."</p>

<p>"They don't need to be put in prison for not having a home," then-House Judiciary B Chairman Andy Gipson said during the debate on the bill, although he added that no one was charged or prosecuted any longer under such terms.</p>

<p>Gipson, now state agricultural commissioner, said at the time that someone might have been prosecuted for sleeping in a park back in the 1940s.</p>

<p>Driving in the left lane</p>

<p>The new left lane law prohibits slower driving vehicles in the left lane of roadways with two or more lanes in the same direction.</p>

<p>"A vehicle shall not be driven continuously in the outermost left lane of a multi-lane roadway whenever it impedes the flow of other traffic," the law says.</p>

<p>The law allows the following exceptions:</p>

<pre><code>•   When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction.

•   When the right lane is closed to traffic while under construction or repair.

•   When the right lane is in disrepair or in an otherwise impassable or unsafe condition.

•   When A vehicle is preparing to exit the roadway on the left.
</code></pre>

<p>Violators of the left lane law will pay a $5 to $50 fine.</p>

<p>Other laws taking effect Sunday:</p>

<p>No more debtor prisons</p>

<p>A reentry law seeks to reduce repeat offenders and do away with debtor prisoners. The measure also creates a study committee to address sentencing disparities across the state for the same crime.</p>

<p>In April, Corinth settled a federal lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law accusing it of unlawfully jailing poor people for their inability to pay bail and fines.</p>

<p>K-9 dogs in ambulance</p>

<p>Injured K-9 dogs can be transported by emergency medical technicians. The bill will allow the dogs injured in the line of duty to be transported by ambulance to a pet hospital or veterinarian if no human needs to be transported.</p>

<p>Service animals for veterans</p>

<p>Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder were added to the list of those with disabilities who are allowed service animals into public buildings. Some say the legislation wasn’t needed because the Americans with Disabilities Act already covered service animals for veterans and others.</p>

<p>Kaelin Kersh Act</p>

<p>The law is named for the former Mississippi State University track and field star who was killed in May when a Highway Patrol SUV crashed into the vehicle in which she was passenger. The law requires any emergency vehicle traveling about 30 miles per hour above the posted speed limit to have blinking lights flashing.</p>

<p>Increase in dog fighting penalties</p>

<p>The maximum penalty for dog fighting increases from three years in custody to five years for a first offense and a maximum 10 years on subsequent offenses. The maximum fine is $10,000.</p>

<p>Pharmacists can help patients save on prescriptions</p>

<p>Pharmacists can tell patients the cheapest way to pay for their prescriptions — and whether their copay is more expensive than the cash price of a drug — under a law passed this session. The law, passed and signed without much notice, makes the insurance companies’ “gag clause” on pharmacies unenforceable.</p>

<p>Prescription syncing</p>

<p>The new law requires insurance companies to help pharmacies “sync” medications for people who have multiple medications, so they only have to make one trip to the pharmacy a month.</p>

<p>AP Reporter Mark Sherman looks at what comes next now that Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy has announced his retirement from the U.S. Supreme Court. President Donald Trump will make his second selection for the high court. (June 27) AP</p>

<p>JACKSON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected appeals from two Mississippi death row inmates.</p>

<p>However, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office, Margaret Ann Morgan, said Richard Gerald Jordan and Timothy Nelson Evans have additional appeals remaining. Neither has an execution date, and "neither is cleared for execution," by the Supreme Court decision, Morgan said.</p>

<p>Jordan, now 72, has been on death row longer than any Mississippi inmate. He was sentenced to death in 1976 for the kidnapping and killing of Edwina Marter earlier that year in Harrison County.</p>

<p>Mississippi Supreme Court records show Jordan traveled from Louisiana to Gulfport, Mississippi, where he called Gulf National Bank and asked to speak to a loan officer. After he was told Charles Marter could speak with him, Jordan ended the call, looked up Marter's home address in a telephone book, went to the house and got in by pretending to work for the electric company.</p>

<p>Records show Jordan kidnapped Edwina Marter, took her to a forest and shot her, then later called her husband and demanded $25,000, saying she was safe.</p>

<p>Jordan is among the inmates challenging Mississippi's lethal injection procedure, with a federal trial set for Aug. 27.</p>

<p>Evans, now 61, was convicted in 2013 for the 2010 killing of Wenda Holling in Hancock County. Court records show Evans had previously been romantically involved with Holling but was living in her home as a tenant when he strangled her. Investigators found Evans used Holling's credit card after her death.</p>

<p>Mississippi's last execution was in June 2012.</p>

<p>In a dissent Thursday, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that the cases of Jordan and Evans illustrate what he had previously written in other death penalty cases — that the death penalty, as applied in the U.S. today, involves "unconscionably long delays, arbitrary application and serious unreliability."</p>

<p>Breyer wrote that the Supreme Court should consider an argument made by Jordan, that execution after decades on death row violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

<p>Breyer also wrote that Jordan and Nelson were both sentenced to death from the 2nd Circuit Court District, and that Evans' attorneys said the district on the Gulf Coast accounts for "the largest number of death sentences" among Mississippi's 22 circuit court districts since 1976. Breyer said that shows the arbitrary application of the death penalty.</p>

<p>Jordan's attorney, Jim Craig, said it's notable that Breyer analyzed the Mississippi cases and found "evidence for the abolition of the death penalty."</p>

<p>Prison officials believe rewarding inmates on good behavior with a special family visitation in September resulted in a drop in the number of those cited for fighting and other infractions. In hopes of keeping that trend going Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County.</p>

<p>Nearly 200 inmates who've stayed out of trouble will be allotted three hours of special family visitation Saturday at the Rankin County facility.</p>

<p>"My staff members have told me what a positive impact they believe this program has," Commissioner Pelicia Hall said. "I applaud the CMCF staff for acting on my charge to come up with programs that cost little to no money to improve rehabilitation and re-entry for inmates."</p>

<p>Up to 100 females and 90 males will be allowed to interact with their children or grandchildren with games, face-painting, and other activities from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Each inmate will be permitted to visit with three children and one adult from the inmate's approved visitation list.</p>

<p>In order to be eligible for the visitation, inmates must go at least a year without a rule violation and have been incarcerated for at least a year.</p>

<p>"We realize that most of these offenders will be released," CMCF Superintendent Ron King said. "Having a strong family support system to include a relationship with their children is very important to their success. The event is also very fun and rewarding for the children."</p>

<p>The cries of undocumented immigrant children being separated from their families at the border have rung through the homes of Americans. Faces of anguish, fear and confusion flash across television screens daily. The cries of those children and their families have been heard and reverberated in the hearts and minds of Mississippians, too.</p>

<p>In response, several Mississippi groups joined in the nationwide "Families Belong Together" movement Saturday and held a rally in Jackson outside of the Governor's Mansion.</p>

<p>The rally was organized by Organizing For Action, the Mississippi chapter of Pantsuit Nation, Indivisible Jackson Metro and the ACLU of Mississippi. Several other local groups, including the Poor People's Campaign and One Voice were also on hand to participate.</p>

<p>People from all walks of life, races, creeds and cultures braved the blistering Mississippi summer heat to express their disdain with the current immigration policies in place. The ACLU estimated that 300 people were at Saturday's rally.</p>

<p>There appeared to be no counter-protestors in favor of the current zero-tolerance policy at the rally.</p>

<p>Story continues after gallery </p>

<p>ACLU of Mississippi Director of Communications Zakiya Summers said the rally's organizers are demanding that Gov. Phil Bryant recall the Mississippi Guard troops sent to the border, refuse to send additional support and forbid anything that criminalizes immigrants and separates families.</p>

<p>More: Miss. Gov. Phil Bryant vows to keep sending National Guard troops to secure U.S. border</p>

<p>"What's happening on the border is reminiscent to what happened to black people long ago. Mississippi should be no part of it, we should have no role in this," Summers said. "This is not who we are, this is not what we represent and we are demanding that this stops now and that families are reunited."</p>

<p>Representatives from each group in attendance were given an opportunity to speak during the rally. Melinda Medina, a community organizer for the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance, gave a fiery speech that garnered a rousing and emotional reaction from the crowd.</p>

<p>"Our leaders might see these lives as nothing more than pawns in their political game, but their contributions to this country make them just as American as your or I," she said. "A reform of our immigration policies is long overdue and we demand this here today."</p>

<p>When Frank Figgers, of One Voice, had an opportunity to speak at the rally he used it to encourage those present to vote. He cited state voting statistics, saying there are 250,000 or more in the state who are not registered to vote and over 200,000 who vote infrequently.</p>

<p>"We in Mississippi have a unique opportunity. A window is opening in November. People make policy and if we want the thing to change then we have to change the people that are making the policy," Figgers said.</p>

<p>Reginald Virgil, a Hattiesburg native and member of MIRA, said he and his organization felt it was important to attend the rally to give a voice to the voiceless and represent people of color who are being mistreated in the country.</p>

<p>"This is America, supposedly the greatest country, and we need to act like it. We need to show that we need to treat everybody with dignity and respect. It is time to change, it is time to make a change, it is time to be the change. Just because it's policy and it's law doesn't make it right," Virgil said.</p>

<p>When asked what could be done to improve the policy and the border crisis, Jackson native Glen Gregory suggested allowing undocumented immigrants to have their day in court.</p>

<p>"Give them a court date, let them have their day in court. Don't' rush this process," he said. "They're trying to put this all on bad people and things, but that's a minority of people who immigrate to this country that want to do better."</p>

<p>Sela Ward's husband is running for U.S. Senate in the state of Mississippi. But it's not the first time he has considered running for office. sarah warnock/clarion ledger</p>

<p>JACKSON — Howard Sherman was already wondering why Mississippi Democrats seemed so unreceptive to his message before his runoff loss Tuesday.</p>

<p>"I'm battling 'What's the point?' a lot," Sherman told The Associated Press six days before state House minority leader David Baria beat him soundly for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate. "There seems to be a very entrenched interest in not changing."</p>

<p>Maybe that was a recognition that the brand of change Sherman was pitching wasn't going to carry the day, as Baria's legislative allies and others in the Democratic establishment rallied to support the person they knew.</p>

<p>The clear implication was that Sherman couldn't be trusted, after having been a registered Republican in California and having given money to Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi in what Sherman defended as an effort to block the ambitions of state Sen. Chris McDaniel. The tea party-backed McDaniel initially prepared to challenge Wicker this year after nearly defeating Republican U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran in 2014.</p>

<p>More: David Baria beats Howard Sherman in U.S. Senate Democratic runoff</p>

<p>Baria has long had a Republican target in his home district in Hancock County. He may have been used to the rough-and-tumble of politics, but it was new for Sherman, a venture capitalist who adopted Meridian as his home after years in California. And the sting of those attacks, and getting beaten pretty handily, clearly showed on election night, as he painted Baria someone who couldn't make a difference.</p>

<p>"From the beginning, it was a square peg in a round hole," Sherman said. "I thought the state was ready for something different. I thought the state was tired of being 50th. But they voted for a shepherd of 50th."</p>

<p>Sherman seemed to think better of his initial sour reaction. He told the AP in a second phone call Tuesday night that "I still absolutely want to see Democrats win both seats in November," referring not only to Baria's race against Wicker, but also to former U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy's bid in a special election where he will face Republicans Cindy Hyde-Smith and McDaniel. Gov. Phil Bryant elevated Hyde-Smith from state agriculture commissioner to U.S. senator in April when he appointed her to fill the vacancy after Cochran retired.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Sherman sent a mass email saying he would support Democrats this year and in the future and urged supporters to "donate to the state party now."</p>

<p>It's unclear how Democrats will regard Sherman in the future, or if he will have any interest in running for office again. But it's easy to imagine a scenario where Sherman is steaming toward an intriguing general election as the Democratic nominee for a different office. Sherman said that before he decided to run for Senate, he considered running for the open seat of retiring U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper in the 3rd Congressional District.</p>

<p>The $850,000 that Sherman raised for his Senate campaign would have been formidable in the district, which spans 24 counties from the state's southwest corner through parts of Jackson and its suburbs to Meridian and Starkville. Compare that to current Democratic nominee Michael Ted Evans. It's hard to tell how much money the state House member and chicken farmer from Preston has raised, but it can't be much. Evans still hadn't filed campaign finance forms with the Federal Election Commission as of Friday.</p>

<p>Going against Republican nominee Michael Guest, the district attorney for Madison and Rankin counties, would have been a tough race, but it wouldn't have been harder than challenging Wicker.</p>

<p>Sherman signed his email by saying "our potential is great. Let's keep that hope alive."</p>

<p>What Sherman's potential is in Mississippi, and whether his hopes are alive, remains to be seen.</p>

<p>The Boys and Girls Club on Raymond Road is a whirlwind of frenetic activity on any given day, with children and teens of all ages there for summer activities.</p>

<p>But on Thursday, a gymnasium full of kids sat almost motionless to hear Special Agent Jeffrey Artis of the FBI talk about gun violence, especially as it applies to them. He asked them questions like, "How many people are afraid someone will bring a gun to school? How many of you think you need a gun to protect yourselves? How many of you live in homes with guns?"</p>

<p>In every case, more hands went up than didn't. At the end of the program, he and two employees of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi asked how many had lost loved ones to gun violence.</p>

<p>Once again, almost every hand went up.</p>

<p>This is the reason, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said, that the prevention piece of Project EJECT is so important. The goal of Project EJECT, modeled after the old Project Safe Neighborhoods in 2001, is to reduce violent crime in an effort to make Jackson neighborhoods safer. Part of that comes from outreach to and cooperation with the communities.</p>

<p>Hurst's office said in a release that the prevention piece started Thursday and will continue with various speaking engagements, interactions and engaging dialogue with our local youth.</p>

<p>“Prosecuting crime alone is not enough. We must do everything we can to prevent crime before it happens," Hurst said. "And one way to prevent crime is to reach out to our young people and let them know we care about them, that there is hope and there are much better alternatives to crime."</p>

<p>Project EJECT — “Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together” is a contiunuation of the school outreach program started by former U.S. Attorney Greg Davis entitled the L.E.A.D. Program. L.E.A.D., which stands for “Legal Enrichment and Decision Making," educates and informs students about the value of an education, as well as the long term consequences of gun violence and criminal activity.</p>

<p>"From what we’ve seen most of the students even at these early ages have encountered some of most of what we talked about, so it’s not new to them, but it’s something they need to hear from a different perspective," Davis told the Clarion Ledger in January 2017. "Hearing from the perspective of the prosecutor's office as someone who wants you to do well as opposed to someone who wants to enforce the law and have them suffer the consequence of their bad decisions, we think is important."</p>

<p>At the end of the program, students were invited to sign a pledge that they wouldn't bring guns to school, that they would resolve their disputes without using guns, and that they would influence their friends to do the same.</p>

<p>Students sign the anti-gun pledge at the Boys and Girls Club as a part of Project EJECT's community outreach strategy.</p>

<p>Hurst thanked Davis for developing L.E.A.D. and said it was only appropriate to restart the program at the Boys and Girls Club of Jackson because former U.S. Attorney Dunn Lampton had dedicated time and resources into the organization.</p>

<p>"The foundations set by these men and many others have laid the groundwork for being able to make our communities and citizens in Jackson and throughout the state safer and more secure,” said Hurst.</p>

<p>The U.S. Attorney’s Office expects to reach more than 400 students in the metro area this summer. The L.E.A.D. program will continue during the school year.</p>

<h2 id="mississippifederaljudgeblastsinsurancecompanyfordenyingdisabilityclaims">Mississippi federal judge blasts insurance company for denying disability claims</h2>

<p>Hadley Malcolm talks with USA TODAY contributor Jeff Reeves regarding disability insurance and what works best for you. Kaveh Rezaei, USA TODAY</p>

<p>A federal judge in Mississippi is the latest to blast a national disability insurance company’s denial of long-term disability claims.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves has reversed Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.’s denial of a disability claim by 62-year-old Juanita Nichols.</p>

<p>Nick Norris, one of Nichols' attorneys, said the case involves Reliance Insurance improperly denying long-term disability benefit to clients.</p>

<p>"But Judge Reeves goes much further by detailing the companies nationwide systemic problem of improperly denying benefits," Norris said.</p>

<p>Reeves threw out Reliance’s motion to dismiss Nichols’ case on Friday, reversed the insurance company decision denying her claim and said he will award attorney fees to her lawyers.</p>

<p>Reliance's attorney Kelly Simpkins said Monday his client doesn't comment on ongoing litigation.</p>

<p>Nichols worked at Peco Foods’ chicken processing factory in Sebastopol. Her duties required her to spend a minimum of 20 percent of her work day in processing areas where temperatures were kept at 8 degrees above freezing or 40 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>In 2016, Nichols was diagnosed with a host of circulatory system disorders including Raynaud’s disease, a condition that causes arteries to become “unduly reactive and enter spasm” when cold, according to court papers. Doctors concluded that exposure to the cold could give Nichols serious circulatory problems, including gangrene. Nichols was prescribed a treatment regimen that included “avoiding ... working in an environment where there is exposure to the cold.”</p>

<p>As a result, Nichols had to stop working at Peco.</p>

<p>Nichols applied for long-term disability benefits through the insurance plan Peco had with Reliance. Under that plan, Nichols qualified for benefits if, as a result of an injury or sickness, she couldn’t perform the material duties of her regular occupation, according to her lawsuit.</p>

<p>Reliance admits that Nichols’ medical conditions prevented her from working in cold temperatures and therefore prevent her from performing her current duties “in a factory where the temperatures are kept at 40 degrees.”</p>

<p>However, one of Reliance’s vocational experts determined that Nichols’ occupation as it was performed in the national economy was “sanitarian,” an occupation with duties that do not require expo-sure to cold temperatures. Based on that, Reliance denied Nichols’ application for disability benefits, according to court records.</p>

<p>Reeves said Reliance has a conflict of interest. He said under its plan with Nichols’ employer, Reliance both evaluates and pays benefits claims.</p>

<p>Reliance “potentially benefits from every denied claim,” Reeves said, “and therefore is operating under a conflict of interest, as Reliance itself admits. The (U.S.) Supreme Court has held that, when an insurer is 'operating under a conflict of interest,' that conflict 'must be weighed as a factor in deter-mining whether there is an abuse of discretion.' The question is how much weight the court should give Reliance’s conflict of interest.”</p>

<p>Reliance’s wrongful claims-related behavior is not a localized problem, Reeves said, noting courts in every federal circuit have repeatedly criticized the insurer’s claims management practices.</p>

<p>Reeves said the Supreme Court has cited a finding that Reliance’s decision to deny a claim for long-term disability benefits was not based on substantial evidence.</p>

<p>Defense lawyers are seeking a hearing for death row inmate Curtis Flowers. Attorneys accuse authorities of failing to share evidence that could have pointed to at least two other suspects in the 1996 quadruple homicide in Winona.</p>

<p>“Stunning new evidence has come to light which underscores the need to give (Flowers) a full and fair opportunity to litigate his post-conviction claims,” the motion says.</p>

<p>“On June 26, counsel for (Flowers) learned that in 1996, the State interviewed, arrested, and held an alternative suspect in the Tardy murders, Willie James Hemphill.”</p>

<p>On the morning of July 16, 1996, someone walked into the Tardy Furniture Store in Winona, killed four employees execution-style and stole nearly $400. Police found bloody footprints made by Fila Grant Hill shoes.</p>

<p>Flowers convicted in first 3 trials. Each time, his conviction was reversed.</p>

<p>On June 14, 2010, in Greenwood, during Curtis Flowers' sixth trial for the Tardy Furniture murders, Clemmie Flemming points out to prosecutor Doug Evans, center, where she spotted Flowers on the morning of the Winona slayings on July 16, 1996.</p>

<p>(Photo: File Photo/The Greenwood Commonwealth via AP)</p>

<p>APM Reports, the investigative and documentary reporting team based in St. Paul, Minnesota, spent a year digging into the Flowers case for its "In the Dark" podcast.</p>

<p>The team tracked down Hemphill, who admitted he wore Fila Grant Hill shoes and lived across from the store. Hemphill, who spent 11 days in jail, said police also taped the interview and took notes.</p>

<p>But defense lawyers never received a copy of that interview and never knew that Hemphill was a suspect.</p>

<p>“In the 22-year history of this case, none of this evidence was ever disclosed to the defense,” the motion says. “The sole reference to Hemphill anywhere in the State’s files that were turned over to the defense is a single-page Miranda waiver that contains no information other than Hemphill’s name.”</p>

<p>Prosecutors are required to share all evidence that tends to show a defendant’s innocence.</p>

<p>Eight months after the killings, police arrested Flowers in Texas. He had worked for the store and had no prior criminal record.</p>

<p>District Attorney Doug Evansportrayed Flowers as a disgruntled employee who had been fired and now had revenge on his mind. A state police investigator testified that authorities found $235 hidden in Flowers' headboard.</p>

<p>Authorities found no weapon. Instead, they pointed to Flowers' relative's gun, which was reportedly stolen that day. According to authorities, Flowers tested positive for a particle of gunpowder residue on the back of his right hand.</p>

<p>He was convicted and sentenced to death in three trials by all-white or nearly all-white juries.</p>

<p>In each case, the state Supreme Court overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial.</p>

<p>Both the high court and the trial judge questioned Evans' dismissals of black potential jurors. (In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors can't strike potential jurors strictly because of race.)</p>

<p>Two juries deadlocked on verdicts. A sixth jury convicted Flowers.</p>

<p>In the fourth trial, the jury deadlocked, splitting along racial lines. Seven white jurors voted to convict, and five black jurors voted to acquit.</p>

<p>In the fifth trial, the jury deadlocked again, this time 11-1 in favor of guilt. The nine white jurors voted in favor of guilt, along with two black jurors.</p>

<p>One black juror voted to acquit, concluding the prosecution failed to prove its case. He told fellow jurors that he was in the alley not long before the killings and didn't see anything.</p>

<p>The judge had the juror arrested for lying during jury questioning because he failed to say he had personal knowledge about the case.</p>

<p>A grand jury indicted the juror for perjury, but the charges were dropped after it was discovered that none of the jurors was ever asked whether he or she had personal knowledge of the crime.</p>

<p>In the sixth trial, there was one black juror; the rest were white. That jury convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death.</p>

<p>In 2014, the state Supreme Court upheld that conviction.</p>

<p>Two years later, the U.S. Supreme Court told state justices to review whether there was discrimination in how some black potential jurors were excluded. In November, state justices said they found no discrimination.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Mississippi's high court reaffirmed its decision, refusing to reconsider Flowers' death sentence.</p>

<p>Witness admits he lied to convict Flowers of murder</p>

<p>Odell Hallmon (right) testifies at Curtis Flowers' sixth murder trial. Hallmon said Flowers admitted to the Tardy Furniture Store slayings.</p>

<p>APM Reports has also raised questions about a key prosecution witness against Flowers, Odell Hallmon, who admitted he lied.</p>

<p>"As far as him telling me he killed some people, hell, naw, he ain't ever told me that. That was a lie," he told APM Reports on a contraband cellphone from his prison cell. "It was all make-believe. Everything was all make-believe on my part ... All of it was just a fantasy, that's all. A bunch of fantasies. A bunch of lies."</p>

<p>Evans told APM Reports this is why a judge instructs a jury that "a jailhouse informant is not very reliable, because they can change their statements very easily, for any reason."</p>

<p>After testifying against Flowers in the sixth trial, Hallmon killed three people and injured a fourth. He is now serving three life sentences for the slayings, plus 20 years for the assault and 10 years for possessing a gun as a felon.</p>

<p>According to his record, it wasn't his first time attacking a police officer, but unfortunately for William Shawn Mann, it was his last.</p>

<p>The man who was shot to death by Grenada County deputies last week had been convicted of attacking police and had stolen a patrol car in the course of a previous attack in 2015.</p>

<p>Mann, of Yazoo City, was paroled on Nov. 17 for his conviction on three counts of simple assault on a police officer, motor vehicle theft, and malicious mischief after an incident in Montgomery County in which he allegedly attacked a deputy and stole his patrol car.</p>

<p>A Grenada County deputy and Mann were both taken to the hospital after an officer-involved shooting June 25, Sheriff Alton Strider said.</p>

<p>Two deputies had answered a call at a home on Carrollton Road. As they finished the call, Mann allegedly came out of the house and jumped into one of the police vehicles and rammed it into the other one, and then accelerated backwards and into some trees, Strider said.</p>

<p>When he drove the car back across the road, Strider said, he attempted to hit one of the deputies.</p>

<p>Eventually they were able to get Mann out of the vehicle and he wrestled one of them to the ground and was on top of him. The two struggled for the deputy's gun, The second deputy tased the suspect multiple times, the sheriff said.</p>

<p>When the taser was having no affect on Mann, the deputy shot him, according to Strider.</p>

<p>One of the deputies went to the emergency room with a shoulder injury. Investigating officials said both officers were lucky to walk away from that altercation with their lives.</p>

<p>Previous encounter</p>

<p>In May 2015, a Montgomery County deputy was flagged down and told that there was a naked man "running up and down" Middleton Road. The deputy found the naked man, who ended up being Mann, a validated Simon City Royal who would be found to be under the influence of cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana.</p>

<p>Mann jumped on the hood of the patrol car, then on to the roof of the vehicle. From there, he jumped on the deputy's back.</p>

<p>Montgomery County Sheriff Bubba Nix said the two scuffled and the deputy was finally able to get him off his back.</p>

<p>"He drew his taser and shot him and he kept coming towards him and he put in another cartridge and shot him again," Nix said at the time.</p>

<p>Two state troopers arrived and he was tased again. Officers were able to handcuff him, but he got free and stole a patrol car, which he took</p>

<p>Mann was tased again once the troopers got there as the three officers tried to get the handcuffs on him, but that didn't stop him. At that point, somehow he was able to get free and steal the patrol car.</p>

<p>Mann drove through several road signs and wrecked the car in front of a dry cleaners. Some people at a nearby car wash saw the accident and thought it was a deputy who had the wreck. They began to approach the car to help him, Nix said.</p>

<p>When Mann jumped out of the vehicle, they scattered, authorities said.</p>

<p>Mann attempted to steal their truck from the car wash. He was finally stopped there by the deputy and the two troopers and arrested.</p>

<p>Mann had been in and out of the system previously with a felony cocaine charge, and was out on bond for a felon with a firearm charge when the Montgomery County interaction happened.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is looking into the Grenada County shooting, which is protocol for an officer-involved shooting.</p>

<p>U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker says he has discussed with President Trump’s administration a replacement for retired 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Grady Jolly, who left the bench almost nine months ago.</p>

<p>“I have discussed the vacancy with President Trump and other members of the administration,” Wicker said in a statement. “The president is listening, asking the right questions, and is giving this nomination thoughtful consideration. I hope he will announce a decision soon.”</p>

<p>Jolly announced in March 2017 he was taking senior status (retiring), effective Oct. 3, 2017 when he celebrated his 80trh birthday.</p>

<p>Seats on the federal appellate court that covers Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas are not legally bound to particular states, but it has been the longstanding practice to replace a judge with someone from the same state. With Jolly's retirements, Mississippi has two active judges on the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, Leslie H. Southwick, who was appointed by then-President George W. Bush, and James E. Graves, who was appointed by then-President Barack Obama.</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant said "With the input of our two senators, I know President Trump will nominate someone who will apply the law, and not engage in judicial activism or policy-making from the bench."</p>

<p>Names mentioned as possible replacements for Jolly include state Supreme Court Justice James D. Maxwell, a former state Court of Appeals judge and former assistant U.S. attorney; State Court of Appeals Justice Jack Wilson, appointed to the court by Bryant in 2015, and U.S. Southern District Chief Judge Dan Jordan, appointed federal judge by then-President George W. Bush in 2006.</p>

<p>Today, the 5th Circuit is authorized 17 active judges, but currently has 15 along with nine senior status judges.</p>

<p>Trump has appointed both U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshals for Mississippi.</p>

<p>Mike Hurst, a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted high-profile government corruption cases and made an unsuccessful but noteworthy run for attorney general in 2015, was appointed and confirmed as U.S. attorney for the Southern District. Trump nominated William Chadwick "Chad" Lamar of Oxford, who had been a longtime assistant U.S. attorney, as U.S. attorney for Mississippi's Northern District. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate.</p>

<p>Daniel McKittrick of Etta was appointed and confirmed as U.S. marshal for the Northern District. Last week, Trump nominated retired Pike County Sheriff Mark Shepherd as marshal for the Southern District. He will have to be confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p>The federal public defender’s position for Mississippi is vacant, but the 5th Circuit appoints the person to oversee that office.</p>

<p>USA TODAY Congressional correspondent Deirdre Shesgreen explains the high stakes of the upcoming election season. USA TODAY</p>

<p>The latest on a Republican U.S. House and Democratic U.S. Senate primary in Mississippi:</p>

<p>6:55 p.m.</p>

<p>Polls are closing in Mississippi, where Democratic voters are deciding a nominee to challenge an incumbent Republican senator, and Republicans are choosing a congressional nominee for an open seat.</p>

<p>In the Democratic runoff, state House minority leader David Baria of Bay St. Louis faces venture capitalist Howard Sherman of Meridian. The winner will face U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker in November.</p>

<p>Baria has emphasized his Democratic service and promised to champion party priorities. Sherman, the husband of actress Sela Ward, has faced criticism for voting Republican when he lived in California and giving money to Republicans including Wicker. He's emphasized his business experience and promised fresh approaches to Mississippi's problems.</p>

<p>In a district that runs diagonally across central Mississippi, District Attorney Michael Guest of Brandon is trying to clinch the Republican nomination over hospital fundraiser Whit Hughes of Madison.</p>

<p>6:15 p.m.</p>

<p>Voters in a Mississippi Republican congressional primary say their choice is between the experience of a longtime prosecutor and the new voice of a hospital fundraiser.</p>

<p>District Attorney Michael Guest of Brandon is seeking the GOP nomination in central Mississippi's 3rd Congressional District against hospital fundraiser and former state economic development official Whit Hughes of Madison. Guest easily finished first in the June 6 primary.</p>

<p>After voting for Hughes on Tuesday, voter Leigh Ann King of Madison said, "He's never been in politics. He's somebody who I think will go in with an open mind."</p>

<p>Others, though, said Guest was a known quality and they approve of his performance as a prosecutor in Madison and Rankin counties.</p>

<p>Seventy-six-year-old retiree Gerald Smith of Madison says of Guest: "He has a track record, which is one of the things that I liked about him."</p>

<p>2:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Reports statewide indicate voter turnout for the runoffs remains low.</p>

<p>Turnout for the first June 5 primary vote was exceptionally low, around 13 percent of the 1.8 million registered voters. Candidates for today's runoffs are urging people to vote.</p>

<p>To find your voting precinct, go to http://www.sos.ms.gov/PollingPlace/Pages/default.aspx</p>

<p>Those remaining in line at the 7 p.m. deadline will still be allowed to cast a vote.</p>

<p>12:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mississippi Secretary of Delbert Hosemann says turnout is "exceptionally" low in primary runoffs Tuesday.</p>

<p>Voters have until 7 p.m. to cast ballots for the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate and the Republican nominee for a U.S. House seat in 24 counties across central Mississippi.</p>

<p>Hosemann says spot checks by staff members in 24 counties indicate few voters in either contest.</p>

<p>The secretary of state says voting has proceeded smoothly, except for a period early this morning where the congressional runoff between Michael Guest of Brandon and Whit Hughes of Madison wasn't on electronic ballots in Simpson County. Hosemann says those voters were offered paper ballots instead.</p>

<p>Democrats statewide are choosing between state House minority leader David Baria of Bay St. Louis and venture capitalist Howard Sherman of Meridian. The winner will challenge U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker and two other candidates in November.</p>

<p>8:30 a.m.</p>

<p>A relative handful of voters could choose Mississippi's Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate and the Republican nominee for a U.S. House seat.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann is warning that turnout could be abysmal in Tuesday's runoff.</p>

<p>Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.</p>

<p>Voters in the 3rd District will choose a Republican nominee to succeed retiring U.S. Rep Greg Harper. District Attorney Michael Guest of Brandon led hospital fundraiser Whit Hughes of Madison in the first primary June 5.</p>

<p>The district contains 24 counties running diagonally across the state's middle.</p>

<p>Democrats statewide will choose between state House minority leader David Baria of Bay St. Louis and venture capitalist Howard Sherman of Meridian. The winner will challenge U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker and two other candidates in November.</p>

<p>South Carolina's prisons director says a riot that led to the deaths of seven inmates was a fight over money, territory and contraband. It took hours to quell, and officials say it was the worst U.S. prison riot in decades. (April 16) AP</p>

<p>COLUMBIA, S.C. — South Carolina prison officials say they sent 48 inmates who have caused major problems to a private prison in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Authorities say the inmates are from prisons across the state. They would not detail how the inmates were chosen or whether they had any role in an April riot that killed seven inmates at Lee Correctional Institution.</p>

<p>A statement from South Carolina Corrections says the inmates were moved to the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Tutwiler, Mississippi, on June 19 and 21. Families weren't notified until the inmates were moved because of security reasons.</p>

<p>Prison officials say an executive order signed by Gov. Henry McMaster cleared earlier hurdles to moving inmates out of state.</p>

<p>It will cost South Carolina $70 a day to keep each inmate at the Mississippi prison.</p>

<p>Over the last century, downtown Jackson has gone through countless transformations. Watch along as we highlight some of the various stages of the city's ongoing evolution. Wochit</p>

<p>Developers are pouring hundreds of millions into revitalizing downtown Jackson.</p>

<p>A nationally recognized hotel opened on Congress Street last fall, and a chain grocery store is expected to open a few blocks over on Capitol Street next year.</p>

<p>New restaurants are popping up and nightlife is booming. More people are living downtown than ever before, and new apartments are being built to accommodate the growing demand.</p>

<p>The city is conquering obstacles that looked insurmountable a decade ago, but downtown Jackson has at least one more hurdle to overcome: a perception about crime. It does not have — according to police, business owners and downtown residents — a major crime problem.</p>

<p>The series:downtown.clarionledger.com</p>

<p>"The downtown area, in terms of violent crimes, we don’t have a violent crime problem in the downtown area," said Jackson Police Chief Anthony Moore.</p>

<p>Moore said "minor thefts," such as car or business burglaries, occur occasionally but those are the exception, not the rule.</p>

<p>JPD keeps a log of crimes throughout the city, broken down by precinct. Downtown Jackson is part of Precinct 2, but the crime tally per precinct is not broken down by block, according to JPS spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes, meaning exact statistics for the area are not available.</p>

<p>However, Ben Allen, executive director of Downtown Jackson Partners, argues that downtown Jackson is the safest 66 blocks in the metro area.</p>

<p>Ben Allen (Photo: File/The Clarion-Ledger)</p>

<p>"In my 11 years at Downtown Jackson Partners, in a daytime city of 25,000, any instance of a major crime has been extremely rare," Allen said.</p>

<p>Both Moore and Allen said a heavy police presence in downtown helps deter any would-be criminals.</p>

<p>JPD headquarters is located downtown on Pascagoula Street and many officers —uniformed and non-uniformed — often park their patrol cars on Congress Street as they walk to and from the precinct.</p>

<p>Monday through Friday, from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m., three uniformed officers are on the downtown beat. On night shift, officers routinely patrol Smith Park and the surrounding area. The department's DART— Direct Action Response Team — also patrols downtown at night. DART, which is made up of patrol officers, is JPD's trouble-shooting arm and typically deals with property crimes or drug reinforcement.</p>

<p>During special events with anticipated heavy foot traffic, at least two officers are on horseback, Moore said. Although JPD is headquartered downtown, the department is also opening up a downtown precinct that will be staffed with two officers at all times, in a proactive effort to deter crime.</p>

<p>"We have such a high police presence, it's going to be almost impossible to do anything in the downtown area," Moore said. "We want our citizens to feel safe and not just our citizens but citizens from other communities who come to the downtown area."</p>

<p>In addition, JPD started a "blue light campaign" in which patrol cars will often park outside businesses with their lights flashing. Moore said the department started the campaign to be a visible presence around the holidays but, it worked so well, the initiative will continue year-round throughout the city, including the downtown area.</p>

<p>"There’s always a high police presence in the downtown area," Moore said. "I want (people) to feel safe, more than anything. Coming to the downtown area, we really try to let our citizens know that this is a safe place, that they won't be harmed or injured going to a restaurant, club or staying in a hotel. The Police Department is right next door to the Westin hotel. Officers are always out, always visible, always seen."</p>

<p>At any given time, Downtown Jackson Partners has six to eight "ambassadors" throughout the downtown area. Highly visible in neon shirts, they sweep up litter, walk people to their cars and can even help jump-start vehicles as needed, Allen said.</p>

<p>They aren't armed, Allen said, but provide a perceived extra layer of security.</p>

<p>Debunking the 'naysayers'</p>

<p>Michael Rejebian, part owner of downtown blues club Underground 119 and a downtown resident, said he's never felt unsafe downtown. Rejebian, who has lived in Jackson 30 years, first moved to the Plaza Building downtown 11 years ago. He moved to an apartment above Parlor Market on Capitol Street a little over a year ago. He decided to stay downtown, he said, because he can't imagine living anywhere else.</p>

<p>Michael Rejebian (Photo: Special to The Clarion-Ledger)</p>

<p>"I really believe in what's happening down here and I wanted to be a part of that and try to do whatever I could to make this renaissance that's going on, to help it happen and to keep it going," he said.</p>

<p>Rejebian said he frequently rides his bike or walks around downtown at night, checking out the local architecture or latest hangout spots. In the past 11 years, the sole issue he's had crime-wise was on Halloween a few years back when a group of teenagers tried to break into cars.</p>

<p>"They weren't even stealing anything," he said. "It was one of those things that could happen in any city. Aside from that, I've never experienced anything.</p>

<p>"You do encounter homeless folks. A lot of people mistake our homeless population as being dangerous, and they're not. They're going to hit you up for a couple of bucks, but if you treat them with the same respect of anybody you would treat in the street, your'e not going to have problems."</p>

<p>Underground 119, located off Congress Street, has "never ever" had any issues, he said. Open until 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday, the club also hires security.</p>

<p>"I've never had one car broken into. We've never had anyone harassed," Rejebian said.</p>

<p>Still, he said, he's heard from the "naysayers" who complain about downtown Jackson — without actually ever spending time downtown.</p>

<p>"The perception of crime downtown is probably the biggest obstacle we face," he said. "I feel it at Underground 119, I feel it just from talking to people who say they don't want to come downtown because they're scared ... I do think there's a significant number of people who use crime to just not like the city of Jackson, I truly believe that. There's no basis in fact for what the people I call the naysayers are saying."</p>

<p>The Mississippi Museum of Art, located off South Lamar Street, hosts approximately 20 public and private events a month, many at night, according to museum director Betsy Bradley.</p>

<p>The venue has a few parking spaces on the side of the building, but during events, many people park in a lot near Court Street or on the street. During her tenure at the museum, Bradley said none of the patrons has ever had an issue with crime. A handful of vandalism instances have occurred, she said, but it has been limited to the outdoor statues being rearranged or the museum's van having a window broken.</p>

<p>Bradley noted the van was sitting in a dark, vacant parking lot and nothing has ever escalated "to the point of any human being being threatened."</p>

<p>"Nothing that has happened to us that has ever made us question that we belong downtown," she said.</p>

<p>The museum has 24/7 security, but Bradley said that's more about protecting the art than anything else.</p>

<p>"I just think, when we have activity in our spaces downtown, our public places, that's the best deterrent, so people need to come downtown."</p>

<p>And people are increasingly coming to the downtown area for their events.</p>

<p>When it came time to choose a reception space for her wedding, Mary Lee Lewis knew she wanted to be downtown. She and her now husband, David Lewis, are ardent supporters of downtown and wanted to share their love of the city with their friends and family. They also wanted to help dispel misconceptions about the area.</p>

<p>"We both really love Jackson and want to be able to show our (local) friends who haven't been downtown before and friends and family from out of town to see a little bit of that," she said.</p>

<p>The couple married in November 2017 at Galloway United Methodist Church on North Congress Street. After the 6 p.m. wedding, many of their guests walked the six blocks south from the church to the Westin on South Congress Street.</p>

<p>Lewis said, at the time of year, it was already dark by the time the wedding ended. None of her guests felt unsafe walking at night downtown, she said.</p>

<p>The couple had their wedding pictures taken downtown. On a whim, they decided to take one in front of the mural at State and Pearl streets.</p>

<p>The completed "Welcome to Jackson" mural on the wall of the Gadow Tyler Law Office on Pearl Street in downtown Jackson was designed and produced by A+ Signs and Creative. The mural was chosen by the Greater Jackson Arts Council and funded in part by Downtown Jackson Partners.</p>

<p>"I said, 'Let's go to the mural' because I feel like it really speaks to our hearts of the city and it speaks to the things to come in the future," she said. "We're really excited about what's to come for downtown."</p>

<p>On-site security</p>

<p>Iron Horse Grill, located on at the edge of downtown on West Pearl Street, hosts a "huge variety" of events including rehearsal dinners, political events for lawmakers and dinners for nonprofits, according to service manager Sarah Black. In her three years with Iron Horse, there hasn't been so much as a car break-in, she said.</p>

<p>The restaurant has security seven days a week beginning at 5 p.m. The officer — armed with a gun and a taser — stays until the close of business each night. Each security officer has a law enforcement background.</p>

<p>Following $6.5 million in renovations and additions, the Iron Horse Grill reopens.</p>

<p>"He does not leave until the last manager leaves, so we all walk out together," Black said. "We have a little army of officers that help us out. We never go without security."</p>

<p>Despite being armed, Black said the officers have never had to deploy a taser or use handcuffs.</p>

<p>Black said she heard rumors of a crime problem when she first began working downtown. After work each night, the servers will often walk to a nearby restaurant or bar and walk back. She's never had an issue. The rumors, she said, are just that —rumors. She worries, however, that people who have yet to venture downtown will let fear keep them away.</p>

<p>"Don't believe everything that you hear," she said. "It's clean, it's well lit and you can really feel the buzz when you're down here."</p>

<p>Having a constant police presence at the restaurant, though rarely needed, can help alleviate those fears or concerns, she said.</p>

<p>"Jackson does have that bad rap where people fear for safety downtown here, so I think having that (police) presence makes people feel comfortable and immediately takes that fear aware when they see blue lights and an armed police officer," Black said. "It just takes that edge off."</p>

<p>When Al Rojas, executive director of the Jackson Convention Complex, moved to the area, he was apprehensive about the message constant blue lights sent to visitors.</p>

<p>"Sometimes folks who are coming from other locations, like I did, seeing blue lights was a sign that something bad was going on," he said. "Being here, I understand why the blue lights are out there, and it does give you a calm once you understand they're proactive, not reactive."</p>

<p>A downtown resident, Rojas said he often feels the insular pressures of "perception and the reality" when talking about all that downtown has to offer.</p>

<p>"We never get to reality because perception blocks us," he said. "Those sound bites really do paint the picture. Is there crime? Yes. Downtown Jackson is not immune or different from any other urban location that has a downtown core but ... what do you do to mitigate opportunity?"</p>

<p>The Jackson Convention Complex hosts about 200 to 250 events a year.</p>

<p>Rojas, who serves on the advisory board of Downtown Jackson Partners, said the businesses and residents downtown have worked together to create a "layered approach" and better the downtown community.</p>

<p>On average, the convention center hosts between 200 to 250 events a year. At a recent event for the United Methodist Church, Rojas was asked to speak to the approximately 3,000 guests about safety. The perception of danger in downtown Jackson seems ever present, he said. So, Rojas talked about knowing where all of the fire exits were in the convention center as well as awareness when walking to the cars and around downtown.</p>

<p>"You've got to make sure they have a good experience, not just at the convention but when they go to the hotels and when they go to restaurants," he said.</p>

<p>Having a visible security presence is a large part of that, he said.</p>

<p>By hiring security officers and contracting with JPD, Rojas said many businesses downtown are taking the same proactive precautions that homeowners do when they advertise their home is armed with a security system.</p>

<p>"You've got to protect your home, you've got to protect what's yours," he said.</p>

<p>Combined with the ambassadors through Downtown Jackson Partners and the "community policing efforts" through JPD, Rojas said he believes the area is one step closer to fighting the perception problem of a crime-ridden downtown.</p>

<p>"They're not happening in silos, they're happening in a consorted effort," he said. "We're doing our part here to educate folks on what is really happening."</p>

<h2 id="didjurymakeupdecidecurtisflowersfateandsendhimtodeathrow">Did jury makeup decide Curtis Flowers' fate and send him to death row?</h2>

<p>by: Dave Mann</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-23</p>

<p>url: https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2018/06/24/race-jurors-predicted-outcome-curtis-flowers-trial-analysis/726802002/ </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court decided 7-to-1 that prosecutors unconstitutionally eliminated black jurors during the trial proceedings for Timothy Tyrone Foster in 1987. USA TODAY</p>

<p>This story is the fourth in a five-part series, produced in collaboration with APM Reports, examining the case of Curtis Flowers. This series is adapted from “In the Dark,” an investigative podcast by APM Reports.</p>

<p>Ray Charles Carter knew he didn’t have a chance.</p>

<p>It was June 18, 2010, and Carter was preparing to give his closing argument in defense of Curtis Flowers. It was the sixth time Flowers had stood trial for the 1996 murders of four people at the Tardy Furniture store in Winona. Three previous convictions had been overturned on appeal, and two other trials had ended in hung juries.</p>

<p>Carter, a longtime Jackson attorney, had defended Flowers in three of those previous trials, and he believed that his client was innocent. But as he rose to give his closing remarks in the Montgomery County courthouse, not far from where the murders had happened, Carter looked at the faces of the 11 whites and one African American sitting on the jury and knew his case was a lost cause.</p>

<p>“I could tell they were rejecting me, disapproving me,” he would later say. “I talked to them, and I scan as I talk. I could just read their faces, read the rejection, read the lack of affection. I mean you can feel when somebody seems to dislike you, has a distaste for you.”</p>

<p>It took the jurors 29 minutes of deliberating to prove Carter right. They found Flowers, who is black, guilty and sentenced him to death.</p>

<p>An APM Reports investigation of the Flowers case has found that the racial makeup of the juries was a powerful predictor of whether Flowers would be found guilty. The two times Flowers was judged by a jury with more than one African American, the juries deadlocked. In the four trials in which he faced an all-white jury or one with 11 whites, he was convicted.</p>

<p>The analysis is among a number of revelations by APM Reports journalists investigating the 22-year-old case. Previous stories have reported that there’s no direct evidence against Flowers and no reliable evidence placing him near the scene or linking him to the murder weapon. Moreover, all three jailhouse informants who testified against Flowers have recanted, one directly to a reporter.</p>

<p>Doug Evans (Photo: File Photo/The Greenwood Commonw)</p>

<p>In the six trials, District Attorney Doug Evans used the overwhelming majority of his strikes in jury selection against black potential jurors. Judges twice found that he’d intentionally struck black jurors because of their race, which is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Evans’ history of picking jurors also favored whites. As the Clarion Ledger recently reported, an APM Reports analysis of Evans’ 26-year tenure found that his office was 4 ½ times more likely to strike black potential jurors than white ones.</p>

<p>Evans hasn’t responded to requests for comment about the jury analysis from either the Clarion Ledger or APM Reports. But he recently told the Greenwood Commonwealth, “I think these folks are just coming up with anything they can to discredit the case. … I’ve had many trials where no black jurors were struck.”</p>

<p>Sixty-one of the 72 jurors in Flowers’ trials were white, and all 61 voted for guilt. Five of the 11 African Americans who have served on Flowers’ six juries have voted for guilt.</p>

<p>In interviews with APM Reports, white jurors in the Flowers case said they were more likely to trust the prosecution and law enforcement. Several white jurors also said they were surprised that African Americans would testify against another African American. They found testimony by black prosecution witnesses especially convincing.</p>

<p>“I wish I could remember what some black woman said on the stand, but I was really kind of surprised when she was on the stand and said that as far as she was concerned, he was guilty,” said Gay Evaldi, a white juror from the third trial. “But there were a lot of blacks that said what they saw, and it kind of helped tell you that he was guilty.”</p>

<p>Jury selection happens in two stages. First, the judge removes from the jury pool anyone who clearly can’t evaluate the case fairly. Then prosecutors and defense attorneys take turns striking potential jurors. In capital trials in Mississippi, each side has 12 strikes. Attorneys can strike a juror for nearly any reason except that person’s race or gender.</p>

<p>In Flowers’ second trial, in March 1999, Judge Clarence Morgan found that Evans had struck a black juror because of race. This is known as a Batson violation, named for the Supreme Court ruling that banned the use of race in jury selection. Morgan overruled Evans’ strike, and the man was the only African American seated on the jury.</p>

<p>In the third trial, in February 2004, Evans used all his strikes against black potential jurors. The jury, of 11 whites and one African American, found Flowers guilty. But the Mississippi Supreme Court overturned the conviction because it ruled that Evans had intentionally struck African Americans from the jury. The justices wrote that it was “as strong a prima facie case of racial discrimination as we have ever seen in the context of a Batson challenge."</p>

<p>The fourth trial featured a jury of seven whites and five African Americans, and in deliberations, it split along racial lines. The fifth trial had a jury of nine white and three African-American jurors, which also deadlocked.</p>

<p>After two mistrials, Carter went into the sixth trial knowing the only direct evidence of Flowers’ guilt was the testimony of Odell Hallmon, a prison inmate who claimed Flowers confessed to the murders.</p>

<p>Carter didn’t think Hallmon, who has a long criminal record dating to the late 1980s, was believable. (In fact, Hallmon recently recanted his testimony in an interview with APM Reports.)</p>

<p>In the early stages of jury selection for that sixth trial, Evans and his assistant prosecutors accepted one African American. They then struck six people from the jury, five of them black. This resembled Evans’ history of picking juries. APM Reports analyzed the jury selection in 225 trials in which full data was available from 1992 through 2017. In that time, Evans’ office struck 50 percent of the eligible black jurors and 11 percent of white jurors.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where that figure comes from,” Evans told the Greenwood Commonwealth. “I haven’t listened to (the podcast), and I don’t intend to because I know what this is about.”</p>

<p>After he saw the panel with 11 white jurors on it — in a county that’s 45 percent black — Carter said he feared the sixth trial had already been decided. “After we picked the jurors, I was convinced that it was an uphill battle. And as time passed, I became more convinced that I didn’t have a chance.</p>

<p>“All I ever wanted was for him to get a fair trial. Get a fair trial, and then I can accept whatever happened. But I can't accept not being given a fair trial.”</p>

<p>The final story in this series will appear July 8. You can download episodes of “In the Dark” on iTunes. You can also read more about the Flowers case at inthedarkpodcast.org.

<p>When breaking news happens, we want you to see it first hand. Thank you for trusting the Clarion Ledger. Wochit</p>

<p>A Grenada County deputy and a suspect were both taken to the hospital after an officer-involved shooting early Monday morning, Sheriff Alton Strider said.</p>

<p>Strider said around 5:30 a.m., two deputies answered a call at a home on Carrollton Road. As they finished the call, the man came out of the house and jumped into one of the police vehicles and rammed it into the other one, then accelerated backwards and into some trees, Strider said.</p>

<p>When he drove the car back across the road, Strider said, the deputies attempted to get him out of the vehicle and he was able to get one of them down on the ground. The two struggled for the deputy's weapon while the other deputy tased the suspect multiple times, the sheriff said.</p>

<p>When the taser was having no affect on the suspect, the deputy shot him, according to Strider.</p>

<p>One of the deputies went to the emergency room with a shoulder injury, and the suspect was also taken to a local hospital where his condition is currently unknown.</p>

<p>Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba confirmed he will make an announcement on the status of the city's police chief on Thursday.</p>

<p>But the question of who he plans to name remains uncertain amid speculation that Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore is on the way out.</p>

<p>Lumumba named Moore as interim chief on Jan. 2 and has until July 2 to make a selection, according to state statute.</p>

<p>Several sources have said Moore doesn't expect to be named, although the mayor deferred any questions to an upcoming Thursday news conference.</p>

<p>The mayor has held out on naming his pick for police chief longer than any other administration official.</p>

<p>"I don't want to do something that is not the best decision because I’m trying to go with the quick decision as opposed to the right decision," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>One name that has consistently come up as a possible replacement is Jackson Police Department Assistant Chief, James Davis. Davis has presided over day-to-day operations in Moore's absence. Davis was not immediately available for comment.</p>

<p>Moore was selected as interim chief after former Chief Lee Vance suddenly announced his retirement in December, months after Lumumba had selected and the City Council had confirmed key officials in his administration.</p>

<p>At the time Lumumba announced his selection of Moore, the mayor said he was impressed by Moore's ideas, energy and most of all by "the respect he garners from his peers."</p>

<p>"That’s what stood out above all. After talking to several officers and putting his name forward as a candidate in meetings with rank-and-file officers, they all spoke highly of him."</p>

<p>Moore joined Jackson Police Department in the mid-1980s as a patrol officer in Precinct 3 and served in that capacity for about nine years.</p>

<p>Vance, a 30-year veteran of the JPD, served as interim chief before he was appointed as chief by former Mayor Tony Yarber.</p>

<h2 id="lettheformerlyincarceratedwork">Let the formerly incarcerated work</h2>

<p>by: Marc Hyden and Jon L. Pritchett</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-22</p>

<p>url: https://www.clarionledger.com/story/opinion/columnists/2018/06/24/let-formerly-incarcerated-work/725946002/ </p>

<p>(Photo: Special to Clarion Ledger)</p>

<p>Mississippi has a recidivism problem that’s jeopardizing public safety and burdening taxpayers. As of 2013, the Magnolia State had the nation’s third-highest incarceration rate per capita. What’s more, research suggests that around 95 percent of Mississippi’s enormous prison population will eventually be freed. And, unfortunately, around three quarters of those released will likely reoffend within five years.</p>

<p>There are policies, however, that can be implemented to help reverse this trend. Researchers have demonstrated that the formerly incarcerated are more likely to return to crime if they cannot find stable employment upon release. But many employers will not hire or even interview someone with a criminal record regardless of their crime, which often leads to long-term unemployment for these individuals. In fact, surveys suggest that 60-75 percent of the formerly incarcerated are jobless up to a year after their release.</p>

<p>Consequently, several states have enacted “second chance” legislation to better these individuals’ odds of landing decent jobs. “Second chance” measures aim to address the unemployment issue by enabling the formerly incarcerated to expunge their records of petty, first-time offenses. Mississippi should similarly strive to remove barriers to employment for these individuals.</p>

<p>Mississippi already has a program that allows certain first-time offenders to petition the court to seal their criminal records. However, these individuals aren’t permitted to have their records expunged under this program if they have been convicted of a misdemeanor traffic offense, such as a DUI. Considering that at least 1 percent of drivers are arrested for DUIs each year, an inordinate number of people are struggling to find gainful employment due to a one-time DUI offense.</p>

<p>More: There is no American tradition of separation of church and state</p>

<p>More: Why should Mississippians care about the culture wars?</p>

<p>DUIs and similar low-level traffic offenses ought to be treated the same as other misdemeanors for the purposes of the first-offender program. Mississippi could follow Texas’ lead in this regard by allowing first-time DUI offenders who registered a 0.14 blood alcohol content or lower to petition for expungement.</p>

<p>Individuals are also ineligible for first-time offender-status — and therefore cannot have their criminal records sealed — if they have been convicted of specific, nonviolent felonies, including many drug crimes. Nationally, 16 percent of inmates are imprisoned due to drug-related crimes. While it isn’t entirely clear how many of these are first-time-offenders, this statistic shows that a large number of individuals could benefit from a fresh start. Mississippi should therefore append more non-violent drug crimes to the list of expungement-eligible offenses.</p>

<p>Also, in many cases, Mississippians who were over 21 years old at the time of their offense are precluded from having their records sealed. Like juveniles, adults over the age of 21 make mistakes and deserve a second chance after their first violation. As a result, Mississippi ought to include more of those who were over 21 years old at the time of their crime into its first-time-offender program.</p>

<p>Continue reading after gallery</p>

<p>Even when offenders actually qualify to have their records sealed, they can’t request an expungement until five years after they have completed their sentence. By that point, many of the formerly incarcerated have already been dealing with criminal background-related joblessness. Like Texas, Mississippi ought to avail the first-time-offender program to individuals immediately upon their completion of court requirements to enable them to quickly obtain work.</p>

<p>Mississippi’s occupational licensing system also impacts formerly-incarcerated individuals’ ability to find employment. Like most states, Mississippi requires state licenses for myriad jobs. While most licenses don’t have strict criminal background requirements, many boards can reject applications based on prior convictions, thereby preventing people from working. Rather than allowing this, the state ought to permit boards to only consider convictions directly related to their industry and allow prospective employers to decide whether they wish to hire someone with a record.</p>

<p>Finally, each of these reforms should be applied retroactively in order to provide past offenders the same second chance as present ones.</p>

<p>Mississippi’s current law is clearly fraught with limitations and desperately needs updating. These proposed measures should not be misinterpreted as being soft on crime. Rather, they are about giving first-time offenders an opportunity to become productive citizens after they’ve been prosecuted and punished for their crimes. These reforms are simply smart public policies. They can decrease the number of formerly-incarcerated people whom Mississippians financially support through various entitlement programs. Further, these reforms would reduce recidivism rates, benefiting the general public with a safer society and reduced tax burden.</p>

<p>Work gives people purpose and contributes to a stronger economy and civil society.</p>

<p>A prospering Mississippi requires putting as many individuals to work as possible. Let’s give the formerly incarcerated the chance to become employed, productive members of society.</p>
