<p>Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba appointed Assistant Police Chief James Davis as Interim Police Chief last Thursday. Chief Davis is the third interim police chief since Mayor Lumumba assumed office in July 2017. However, there is a question of whether Chief Davis can serve as Interim Chief without a confirmation vote for 180 or 90 days.</p>

<p>Facebook</p>

<p>View Video (24:31)</p>

<p>Posted by City of Jackson - Mayor's Office</p>

<p>*Chief of Staff Safiyah Omari introduce former WJTV reporter Candice Cole as the new Communications Director.</p>

<p>*Ms. Cole announced Interim Chief Anthony Moore was stepping down from the position. She thanked him for several accomplishments:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Creating the Police ID Task Force</p></li>

<li><p>Eliminating the distribution of mug shots for juvenile suspects</p></li>

<li><p>Implementation of Independent Review Process for officer-involved shootings.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>No mention was made about any reductions in crime, fighting crime, or for that matter, anything related to crime.</p>

<p>*Assistant Chief James Davis was promoted to Interim Chief. A press release provided information about his background:</p>

<p>Interim Chief James Davis brings nearly25 years of experience with the Jackson Police Department to his new role. His first 10 years were spent as a patrol officer before becoming the first Black Range Master at the training academy. From there, he came up through the ranks of the department being named Sargent then Lieutenant of the 3rd Precinct. He then went on to become District Commander, Deputy Chief, and then Assistant Chief. Chief James also has 15 years with the SWAT Team and is touted as a superior marksman.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ms. Cole introduced Chief Davis. He thanked his wife and the Mayor for the opportunity to serve as police chief. He asked the public to help JPD and said that the police could not fight crime without the public's help.</li>
</ul>

<p>*Mayor Lumumba announced that he is commencing a "search for a permanent police chief." He invited Chief Davis to submit his name for the permanent position.</p>

<p>Ross Adams (8:45) asked the Mayor if there was a lack of stability at the position. Chief Davis is the third chief under the Lumumba administration in less than a year. Mayor Lumumba said he was complying with the "new law that requires a chief to be confirmed within 180 days." He said the law "presents a new challenge" that his administration was the first administration to actually have to to face that challenge."</p>

<p>However, the law went into effect on July 1, 2016. The law placed a 180-day limit on interim appointments serving in positions that required a confirmation vote from the legislative branch. The Attorney General decreed in a 2016 opinion that the 180-day limitation would begin to run for the interim appointments on July 1, 2017. The law was amended in 2017 to include appointments to boards and commissions that required confirmation votes.</p>

<p>Hold on to your hats. The law was amended yet again in 2018.* The law states that as of today, interim appointments can only serve for 90 days without a confirmation vote. The Mayor will undoubtedly argue that Chief Davis can serve for 180 days without a confirmation vote since he was appointed before the effective date of the new law, July 1, 2018. The new law also allows registered voters of the municipality to sue to enforce the law in Chancery Court. The city must pay the attorney's fees for the voter if he wins the lawsuit. Othor Cain asked an interesting question about it at 12:10.</p>

<p>*The Mayor said former Chief Moore had not decided whether to remain at JPD. He said he asked Mr. Moore to stay.</p>

<p>Kingfish note: One troubling feature of Chief Moore's tenure was wall that was put up between the public and information about crime. The Comstat reports had not been updated on the city website since November. Chief Moore changed the meeting schedule of Comstat meetings from weekly to bi-weekly and those meetings were often cancelled. The number of homicides is no longer included with press releases reporting a homicide. The amount of raw information that is available to citizens has been greatly reduced under the Lumumba administration as it was under his father. At least they put the minutes of City Council meetings on the website. Harvey Johnson wouldn't allow those to be posted. Two JPD employees in the Comstat department recently quit so don't expect the release of crime information may not improve anytime soon.</p>

<p>It is concerning that the Mayor has taken over a year to appoint a permanent police chief. JPD has had three chiefs in less than a year and if another change is made, it will be 4 chiefs in less than 18 months. Mayor Lumumba can cite the "challenge" of complying with the law but he has had a whole year to hire a permanent chief. Apple, Microsoft, and IBM manage to hire new CEO's in less than a year. There is simply no reason why the city of Jackson can not hire a police chief in less than a year. Here is some sincere advice for the Mayor: get rid of the pointy-head professors. PhD's are great at thinking and talking but aren't so great at doing. They are masters of creating endless lists of criteria and master plans that somehow never seem to work or get implemented. Get some people around you who have a record of doing something instead of talking about something.</p>

<ul>
<li>Here is the new law.</li>
</ul>

<p>SECTION 2. Section 21-15-41, Mississippi Code of 1972, is amended as follows:</p>

<p>21-15-41. (1) No person shall serve in an interim or hold-over capacity for longer than * * * ninety (90) days in a position that is required by law to be filled by appointment of the governing body of a municipality, or by mayoral appointment with the advice and consent of the council or aldermen. If such position is not filled within * * * ninety (90) days after the expiration of the position's term, or within * * * ninety (90) days after the date of appointment if an interim appointment, the hold-over service or interim appointment shall terminate and no municipal funds may thereafter be expended to compensate the person serving in the position. Further, any action or vote taken by such person after the * * * ninety-day period shall be invalid and without effect. If a council or board of aldermen rejects, or otherwise fails to confirm, an individual submitted by the mayor for appointment, the mayor may not resubmit or reappoint the same individual for that position during the remainder of the mayor's current term in office.</p>

<p>(2) It is the intent of the Legislature that the provisions of this section shall apply * * * to all appointees serving in a hold-over or interim capacity on the effective date of this act * * *. For such appointees, the * * * limitation period * * * for serving in a hold-over or interim capacity shall be no longer than ninety (90) days from July 1, 2018.</p>

<p>(3) Any registered voter who resides in the municipality may file all objections to any matters relating to an alleged violation of this section in the chancery court of the county where the municipality is located. The chancery court is authorized to adjudicate and determine relief as may be proper. The court shall award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the prevailing party. Copy of bill. </p>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-06-21</p>

<p>url: https://starkvilledailynews.com/node/123769 </p>

<p>Staff Writer</p>

<p>STARKVILLE, MS</p>

<p>The Oktibbeha County Sheriff’s Office will begin easing into the use of body cameras in their daily routine starting today.</p>

<p>Oktibbeha County Sheriff Steve Gladney said deputies used body cameras in the past, but they were a cheaper version, lower quality and didn’t last long.</p>

<p>Gladney said the main problem OCSO had obtaining the cameras was providing the upgrades to their server to properly store the footage.</p>

<p>“Getting the body cameras is pretty simple, but being able to store all of the footage, it becomes a problem,” Gladney said.</p>

<p>Chief Deputy Chadd Gar said there were recommendations from different law enforcement agencies on which cameras to purchase.</p>

<p>“We actually got three different types of cameras and gave them to three different deputies,” Gar said. “Then they came in and gave a report.”</p>

<p>After hearing the reports, Gar and Gladney decided the L-3 body camera would be the best fit for the deputies.</p>

<p>Gar said the decision of the L-3 camera came from it only being one piece of equipment for the deputy to manage, and was user friendly.</p>

<p>“The least you can have hanging on your uniform when you’re working patrol the better,” Gar said.</p>

<p>OCSO will unofficially go live with the body cameras until Sept. 1, to help deputies get used to the new equipment and work out the kinks before the first Mississippi State University home football game.</p>

<p>“It gives us some time. We don’t want to lose a video because we don’t know what we’re doing and then have to answer those questions,” Garr said.</p>

<p>As for protocol, Gar said he advises deputies to turn the camera on the minute a call comes in, to monitor radio traffic, but the standard will be to turn it once they arrive on scene.</p>

<p>Gar said if the deputy is going to be directing traffic, or if they are helping a resident change a tire, their supervisor can give them the go ahead to turn the camera off.</p>

<p>“You’re going to know by the nature of the call too a lot of the times,” Gladney said.</p>

<p>Gladney said the importance of the body cameras will be crucial when it comes to solving cases, especially when they can go to court and show the judge and the jury the raw video.</p>

<p>“If there’s a question in there, hey, the body camera is going to tell the truth,” Gladney said.</p>

<p>Gar said there’s an old saying that says there’s three versions of a story: your version, my version and the real version.</p>

<p>“Now, we can take all three of them into court,” Bar said.</p>

<p>Investigators will also be required to wear body cameras, so there is no question as to how evidence was collected.</p>

<p>As for the security of the body camera footage, Gar said it would be nearly impossible for anyone to tamper with the video. He said there is software in place, which will log every detail of who opens it.</p>

<p>“Anybody that goes in and views it, it shows that,” Gar said. “Anybody that downloads it, it shows that, so it’s a chain of custody.”</p>

<p>FedEx has won regulatory approval from Federal Aviation Administration for an overhaul of older sections of the FedEx Express world hub in Memphis. Wochit</p>

<p>Buy Photo</p>

<p>Drones will deliver parts at the FedEx hub and medical supplies at Shelby Farms and the Liberty Bowl as part of a new nationwide project to accelerate their integration into the National Airspace System.</p>

<p>The Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority, in partnership with FedEx and others, was announced Wednesday as one of 10 federal partners in a Trump administration push to advance America's use of unmanned aircraft systems.</p>

<p>More: New tech partnership brings coding, drone programming classes to Memphis kids</p>

<p>Memphis International Airport officials said their project would employ drones weighing 55 pounds or less in four areas:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The airport will use drones for perimeter security and to detect foreign objects and debris on runways. Drones will be operated beyond visual line of sight of operators, and pilots will be alerted to the presence of drones.</p></li>

<li><p>FedEx will use drones to inspect aircraft, track assets, facility security and emergency response. It will use drones to deliver small aircraft parts on a defined path in the north ramp area at the hub.</p></li>

<li><p>In an area covering Shelby Farms, Agricenter International and the Wolf and Mississippi Rivers, drones will be used for precision agriculture, environmental protection, infrastructure protection and package delivery for medical needs within Shelby Farms.</p></li>

<li><p>The city will operate drones within airspace including the Liberty Bowl. Uses will include infrastructure inspection, public safety and medical deliveries.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The airport authority will partner with the City of Memphis, city police and fire departments, Agricenter International, the University of Memphis, the Tennessee Department of Transportation Division of Aeronautics, FedEx, GE subsidiaries AirXOS and Avitas, Intel, Flirtey, 901Drones, Express Drone Parts and ForeverReady Productions.</p>

<p>Airport Authority president Scott Brockman and U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Memphis, said FedEx, the airport's largest customer, is key to the project.</p>

<p>"Being done in Memphis, it will be done with the help of FedEx and will absolutely, positively be done right," Cohen said.</p>

<p>FedEx spokeswoman Maury Donahue said, "FedEx continues to be a leader in transportation technology that improves safety and efficiency for our team members, operations and customers. We are supportive of testing and research in the FAA Unmanned Aircraft System pilot program. We are pleased that the FAA has selected Memphis as a test site for the program."</p>

<p>Brockman said the airport authority has been working on the application since last year.</p>

<p>“This is a tremendous opportunity for Memphis International Airport and its partners to explore how drones can be safely and effectively utilized in the Mid-South," Brockman said. "We formed a very strong team of partners in our bid to be considered as a program participant and are grateful to have been selected.”</p>

<p>Cohen added, "This is a major development for Memphis and puts us on the map as a major player in the nascent drone industry. In the months ahead, Memphis will increase its stature as a center for this cutting-edge technology and will advance the integration of unmanned aerial systems into the national airspace. The economic impact of this announcement cannot be overstated, and I congratulate the airport authority and its partners for this major achievement.”</p>

<p>The Memphis project was one of more than 150 applications for a drone initiative ordered by President Trump.</p>

<p>Chao said the U.S. is at a tipping point in the introduction of drones. As of May 4, there were 1.1 million registered drones in the U.S. and more than 90,000 registered drone operators, she said.</p>

<p>The projects will help the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration write rules to govern safe integration of drones into the National Airspace System, Chao said. The agencies’ partners will test drones under a variety of conditions that are currently forbidden, she said.</p>

<p>Programs around the country will look at night flights, flights over people and beyond a pilot’s line of sight, package delivery, detect-and-avoid technologies and the reliability and security of data links between pilots and aircraft.</p>

<p>Chao said the program has implications for commerce, photography, emergency management, agricultural support, health care, infrastructure inspections and "even human transportation."</p>

<p>An east Birmingham man serving 20 years in prison for attempted murder and robbery is under investigation after he posted a disturbing video to Facebook Monday - from prison.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old St. Clair County Correctional Facility inmate posted the video showing him holding what appears to be a piece of wood or some other blunt force object and a second inmate holding a large knife. They are ordering an older inmate to "lay down. "</p>

<p>"You're going to take three licks...bend your (expletive) over,'' he says on the video.</p>

<p>He got two licks in before the older inmate lunged forward and fought back. The inmate removed the video from Facebook and then posted a Facebook Live video trying to defend his actions when viewers told him he was wrong for the attack.</p>

<p>Alabama Department of Corrections spokesman Bob Horton said prison officials are aware of the attack and are investigating. There were no serious injuries reported.</p>

<p>Horton said the inmates will be moved to separate areas of the facility. Officials are conducting an inspection of the housing area for weapons and will take appropriate disciplinary actions.</p>

<p>The inmate who posted the video pleaded guilty in Jefferson County to attempted murder in 2011 for the shooting of another man with a pistol. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison.</p>

<p>That same year he also pleaded guilty to four counts of robbery after he and three others were arrested in western Birmingham. That robbery happened at 1:55 a.m. on July 6, 2011 in the 1800 block of Fulton Avenue. Police at the time said the four suspects pulled up alongside a vehicle carrying four women and forced them, at gunpoint, to the side of the road. They took money and other unknown items from the four women but didn't harm them. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison with four years to serve in those cases.</p>

<p>Court records show the inmate was disciplined just last year after being found guilty for having a cell phone in prison. He received 30 days of disciplinary segregation, loss of canteen and telephone privileges for 45 days and loss of visiting privileges for 180 days.</p>

<p>ADOC last year said it has increased inspections and searches and was in the process of installing new body scanners in its facilities for finding and detecting contraband. The department has also considered trained canine units as an option for interdicting the contraband phones.</p>

<p>To further address the problem at the national level, ADOC Commissioner Jeff Dunn and corrections directors from other states met with FCC officials in Washington in March to weigh technologies that could one day render them ineffective inside prisons.</p>

<p>Dunn said ADOC has made it a top priority to eliminate corruption and find solutions for making contraband cellphones inoperable inside state prisons. In 2016, ADOC seized more than 3,500 illegal cellphones and made over 70 contraband arrests.</p>

<p>A 2017 story by NBC News said Alabama is in the Top 10 of states with problems of inmates having cell phones in lockup. The report said devices snuck in by visitors or prison staff are a problem at lockups across the nation, but a review of data from 44 states shows that nine of the 10 states with the highest cellphone seizure rates are in the South.</p>

<p>In South Carolina, prison officers have found and taken one phone for every three inmates, the highest rate in the country. In Oklahoma, it's one phone for every six prisoners, the nation's second-highest rate. Other states in the top 10 are Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, Florida and Arkansas and Louisiana; the only one outside the region was California. NBC based its rankings on data provided by the state corrections departments.</p>

<p>Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), commonly known as drones, have proven useful both for the military and the public.</p>

<p>They can be relatively inexpensive devices with a variety of capabilities which includes obtaining aerial photos and surveillance video, as well as transporting a wide range of objects.</p>

<p>Courtesy of AeroVironment</p>

<p>A lack of a common testing site and high costs have hampered the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) efforts to evaluate and demonstrate drones in a timely manner.</p>

<p>However, DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T), Four-Time Winner in the 2017 ‘ASTORS’ Homeland Security Award Program, is taking initiative to prepare integrating drones into DHS’ and other federal agencies’ missions by providing accessible demonstration sites for both land and maritime based operations.</p>

<p>Professionals from S&amp;T and the United States Coast Guard (USCG) conducted demonstrations and tests at two sites in Mississippi during the first half of January.</p>

<p>Land-Based Drone Evaluation and Training at Camp Shelby</p>

<p>S&amp;T held its first tour of Camp Shelby, Mississippi to view available outdoor space and building facilities for land-based testing and training with drones and robots.</p>

<p>The site, available since August 2017 through a contract partnership with the Army National Guard, is intended for DHS components and other federal agencies.</p>

<p>Those agencies include U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the USCG, U.S. Secret Service (USSS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and S&amp;T’s First Responders Group (FRG).</p>

<p>The site is a cost-effective alternative for the agencies, requiring only necessary test expenses.</p>

<p>”The Camp Shelby site has villages and rough terrain to use for different types of scenarios,” said Tim Bennett, S&amp;T Program Manager for air-based technologies to address land and maritime border security.</p>

<p>“Any federal agency that is interested in demonstrating or evaluating, not only drones but also ground robotics, can go there.”</p>

<p>The site is an expansive plot of land spanning 35,000 square acres, with restricted air space, managed by the Army National Guard who is responsible for drone permissions.</p>

<p>Moving forward, S&amp;T plans to demonstrate a wide range of drone capabilities and applications.</p>

<p>For example, one of the capabilities for testing will be equipping commercial drones with GPS systems that are resistant to jamming (blocking GPS signals), and spoofing (broadcasting false GPS coordinates).</p>

<p>“We can provide all our components, like ICE, Coast Guard, and CBP, a system they can use for protecting their drones from bad guys trying to either take over their aircraft, spoof or jam them,” said Bennett.</p>

<p>“And at the same time locate the bad guys with the drones.”</p>

<p>“Jammers and spoofers” are currently illegal in the United States to safeguard against potential interference with local airports’ GPS signal receptions, amongst and other concerns.</p>

<p>Beginning in June at Camp Shelby, S&amp;T plans to evaluate additional drones currently available on the market against scenarios suitable for ICE and U.S. Border Patrol operations, which will provide data for performance reports on these devices.</p>

<p>“It is sort of like a Consumer Report,” explained Bennett.</p>

<p>Drones will be evaluated for providing assistance to people in remote locations, such as mountain ranges for example, as well as for disaster areas to determine search and rescue (SAR) capabilities to locate lost or injured persons, and deliver remote assistance.</p>

<p>During demonstration day at Camp Shelby, attendees witnessed a medical drone which includes transport of a medical package that held newly developed high-tech glasses.</p>

<p>“You put the glasses on, and the doctor at another place who has the similar glasses can see what you can see and could direct you until help arrives,” explained Bennett.</p>

<p>“For example, if you are bleeding, the doctor would explain how to put a tourniquet on.”</p>

<p>Maritime-based Drone Evaluations and Training at Singing River Island</p>

<p>The same week on Singing River Island, in Pascagoula, Mississippi, S&amp;T and the USCG held a VIP day for representatives from the USS, CBP, ICE, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for a maritime-based drone test.</p>

<p>Courtesy of DJI</p>

<p>A payload (the weight a drone can carry, such as extra cameras, sensors, or packages for delivery) which included multispectral cameras was demonstrated, capable of mapping areas.</p>

<p>Mapping technology is very useful for various DHS mission scenarios such as change detection, oil spills, search and rescue, and post-storm damage assessments.</p>

<p>The Singing River Island facility is available for maritime evaluations of drones only to DHS through a contract partnership with Mississippi State University.</p>

<p>“We need to investigate what kind of payloads can be integrated on these drones, not just for Coast Guard’s mission scenarios, but for DHS as well,” said Stephen Dunn, research scientist who evaluates the Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) for the Coast Guard’s Research and Development Center.</p>

<p>“For maritime applications, it would be best if drones can land safely on water,” said Dunn.</p>

<p>“We want to be able to throw them in the air, land them on the water, pick them up, change the battery, and throw them again.”</p>

<p>The Coast Guard and S&amp;T worked with AeroVironment, one of the two companies manufacturing drones specifically designed for maritime operations.</p>

<p>AeroVironment demonstrated their payload products and prototypes during the VIP day, which they flew against mission scenarios that S&amp;T and the Coast Guard generated.</p>

<p>Another important scenario is search and rescue (SAR).</p>

<p>S&amp;T and the Coast Guard evaluated the ability of AeroVironment drones, called Puma All Environment (AE), to detect anchored rafts and simulated people in the water targets that are heated so that infrared cameras can detect them.</p>

<p>The new i45 camera has the ability to autonomously provide a down-looking preset, called NADIR Mode, that was successfully used to map out a search area and detect targets.</p>

<p>“If an operator was doing this, he would be looking here or there, zooming in and out, and there is a chance he can miss a target,” said Dunn.</p>

<p>”With the autonomous camera, your coverage is 100 percent of the search area.”</p>

<p>Another mission scenario involved oil spills.</p>

<p>Courtesy of YouTube</p>

<p>The key for oil spills is that drones provide a better view from high above.</p>

<p>“Drones can actually ‘see’ where the oil spill is going and how large it is,” said Dunn.</p>

<p>For post-storm damage assessment scenarios, traditionally, the Coast Guard would send an airplane or a helicopter, which have a high operating cost.</p>

<p>“Drones would cost significantly less,” said Dunn. “You can fly small drones and provide a rapid damage assessment.”</p>

<p>Border Patrol can also use this surveillance capability to track illegal immigration.</p>

<p>“Patrol officers can fly a drone over a period of time at the border to search for signs of illegal crossings – footprints in the sand or tire tracks,” said Dunn.</p>

<p>“If migrants are coming across a certain path, the officers can see where they have actually crossed.”</p>

<p>Additionally, drones can be used to provide law enforcement agents situational awareness and surveillance.</p>

<p>During law enforcement mission scenarios, drones flew over vessels where people carried fake weapons to evaluate if the camera could identify hand guns and rifles.</p>

<p>One of the key findings from the tests at Singing River Island is that payloads need to be assessed in more geographical locations.</p>

<p>Courtesy of AeroVironment</p>

<p>To see how sensors perform in different climates, the Coast Guard has been conducting tests, which will be completed this year, in five different locations – Alaska, California, Florida, Missouri, and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p>DHS Drone Outlook</p>

<p>S&amp;T is working with NASA and the FAA to eventually open up the national airspace to commercial drone traffic using a drone traffic management system known as Unmanned Aircraft Systems Traffic Management system.</p>

<p>“When the airspace is open for drones, around 2020, they are going to be everywhere,” Bennett said.</p>

<p>“They have quite a few issues to solve beforehand and a lot of new technology needs to come out first.”</p>

<p>The Coast Guard is starting a one-year pilot program for short-range drone prototypes, and, currently, S&amp;T is experimenting and demonstrating with drones.</p>

<p>“We are getting ready to launch the use of small drones as a standard DHS tool by taking advantage of the new test sites,” said Bennett.</p>

<h2 id="mybrotherisdeadagonyofuncertaintyturnstogriefforfamilyofbordercrosser">'My brother is dead': Agony of uncertainty turns to grief for family of border crosser</h2>

<p>by: Daniel González</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-17</p>

<p>url: https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/border-issues/2017/12/18/selene-ramirez-brother-missing-border-crosser-body-found-dna-identification/733002001/ </p>

<p>With more eyes watching the border, migrants are forced to walk for days in their attempt to cross from Mexico into the United States. Some make it. Some die. A USA TODAY NETWORK video production.</p>

<p>(Photo: Nick Oza/USA TODAY NETWORK)</p>

<p>SONOYTA, Mexico — The body of Carlos Martinez arrived in the back of a dark blue Lincoln Navigator with the name of the funeral home, Soto Funeraria, on the door.</p>

<p>Selene Ramirez rushed over to peer inside a rear passenger door, along with her mother, an aunt and an older sister, while two of her uncles stood by.</p>

<p>The last time Ramirez remembers seeing her older brother, he was alive; they were laughing in her bedroom reminiscing about their childhood before Martinez set out to illegally cross the border through the deadly Arizona desert in mid-June.</p>

<p>The sight of his skeletal remains heavily wrapped in blue plasticconfirmed he was dead. Ramirez and the other women began to sob; their wails shattered the late-afternoon quiet of that September day.</p>

<p>The remains of nearly 3,000 immigrants who died after illegally crossing the border have been found since 2001 in southern Arizona, the deadliest corridor along the southwestern border. Nearly 1,000 have yet to be identified, while hundreds of missing migrants who are believed to have perished still haven't been found, and may never be.</p>

<p>In other border states, the deaths of hundreds of border crossers often go uncounted because local authorities don't track or report them. As a result, many families of border crossers are forced to live with the agonizing uncertainty of not knowing if their loved one is alive or dead.</p>

<p>For Ramirez and her family, that agony was over. The uncertainty could now turn to grief.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you I am relieved because I am not," Ramirez said after her brother's remains were identified through DNA tests. "My brother is dead."</p>

<p>But in a way, "it is relieving to at least be able to take him home."</p>

<p>The discovery</p>

<p>The USA TODAY NETWORK accompanied Ramirez, a U.S. Citizen born in Phoenix, in late June as she drove out into the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument to search for her missing brother.</p>

<p>Several migrants who illegally crossed the border with him told Ramirez during a phone call that her brother had fallen ill in the heat. They said he collapsed in a valley south of a tooth-shaped mountain formation known as La Muela, the Molar, deep in the wilderness of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument about 12 miles north of the border.</p>

<p>Brought to the U.S. illegally when he was 9 months old, Martinez grew up in Phoenix. Arizona was home, his sister said. On his left shoulder was a tattoo: “AZ” inside the outline of the state's borders.</p>

<p>He was trying to return to Phoenix after being deported in 2016 for the second time. He was first deported in 2010 following a felony conviction for illegally firing a gun inside city limits when he was 17.</p>

<p>Ramirez's search was documented in a story and video documentary produced as part of the USA TODAY NETWORK's "The Wall" project. The nine-month reporting effort examined the unknown stories and unintended consequences of President Donald Trump's promise to build a wall along the entire 2,000-mile-long border separating the U.S. and Mexico.</p>

<p>Ramirez didn't find her brother's body during the June search. But about three weeks later, in mid-July, migrants trekking through the same area discovered skeletal remains clad in camouflage pants and Fruit of the Loom underwear, the brand Martinez was wearing the day he crossed the border.</p>

<p>This is the story of what happened after Martinez's body was found.</p>

<p>Awaiting DNA results</p>

<p>The migrants carried the remains back across the border into Mexico and left the body by a bridge along Highway 2, which runs along the border.</p>

<p>After being recovered by Mexican police, the remains were taken to a morgue in Sonoyta, a border town across from Lukeville, Arizona.</p>

<p>Mexican officials told the family DNA results could take until 2018.</p>

<p>But Ramirez and her family were desperate for an answer and called daily, sometimes multiple times a day.</p>

<p>"We just kept pushing them and pushing them until we finally got the results back," Ramirez said. "It was very, very stressful."</p>

<p>In late September, Mexican authorities contacted Ramirez's mother in Mexico and informed her that DNA results had verified the remains belonged to Martinez.</p>

<p>That same day, Ramirez left her child-care job in Phoenix and traveled with her 13-year-old sister, Stephany, by shuttle to the border. From there, they took a bus to Cananea, Mexico, arriving after midnight to meet their mother and the rest of their family in the Sonoran mining town about 50 miles southwest of Bisbee, Arizona.</p>

<p>The next day, Ramirez and several members of her family drove to Sonoyta to retrieve the body from the funeral home.</p>

<p>Identifying the dead</p>

<p>Because Martinez's body was carried back to Mexico, it would not be counted in data kept by the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner. That agency conducts autopsies on the bodies of migrants recovered in Pima, Santa Cruz and Cochise counties. where the vast majority of migrant deaths in southern Arizona occur.</p>

<p>Since 2001, the remains of nearly 2,900 migrants have been found in southern Arizona, according to the Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants, which maps migrant deaths based on data provided by the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner, and the Maricopa Office of the Medical Examiner.</p>

<p>Through Dec. 6, 123 remains have been recovered in southern Arizona this yearand turned over to the Pima County Office of the Medical Examiner. Of those, 27 had been identified.</p>

<p>Data kept by the medical examiners shows many migrants die of heat exposure or hypothermia. In most cases, only skeletal remains are found, making it difficult to determine the exact cause of death. It's unknown how Martinez died, but it most likely was due to heat exposure.</p>

<p>'That's not my brother. That's just bones'</p>

<p>Ramirez and her family arrived in Sonoyta at 2:30 p.m.</p>

<p>They planned to pick up the body at a funeral home there, drive an hour and a half to a funeral home in Caborca to have the remains cremated, and then be back in Cananea by 10 or 11 p.m. with the ashes for a memorial service.</p>

<p>They had spent the morning cooking a large pot of menudo, tripe soup, to serve guests and family at the memorial service.</p>

<p>But that is not how the day turned out.</p>

<p>Selene Ramirez (right) consoles her sister, Reyna Martinez, outside the funeral home in Sonoyta, Mexico, after they arrived to reclaim the body of their brother Carlos Martinez.</p>

<p>When the family arrived at the Soto Funeral Home in Sonoyta, the director told them the death certificate needed to be signed by the medical examiner, who was 60 miles away in Puerto Peñasco.</p>

<p>The family waited outside the funeral director's house while one of the investigators from the attorney general's office drove toward Puerto Peñasco. Someone was going to meet him halfway with the signed certificate. He should be back in an hour, the family was told.</p>

<p>While the investigator was gone, the funeral director arrived at the house, with the body in the back of her Lincoln Navigator. After looking at Martinez's remains, Ramirez and her family sat on the curb, smoking cigarettes, as day turned to night.</p>

<p>"A lot of people, they get to see their loved ones. They get to touch them. We don't get to see him. We don't get to touch him. We get to take him home in a box," Ramirez said as they waited. "That's not my brother. That's just bones."</p>

<p>Hours passed.</p>

<p>Finally, just before 10 p.m., the funeral director returned with the death certificate. By then the family had been waiting nearly eight hours. Even so, they were determined to return to Cananea that night. Besides, the funeral home in Caborca had promised to wait for them to do the cremation, no matter how late they arrived.</p>

<p>Ramirez sat in the back of her brother's black SUV as they followed the funeral director's vehicle carrying Martinez's body to Caborca, 95 miles away.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of town, the convoy passed a checkpoint. Dozens of heavily armed federal police officers stood by on the lookout for drug cartel smugglers. The flashing lights on their police vehicles lit up the night.</p>

<p>Ashes</p>

<p>Selene Ramirez and her uncle peer into a box containing Carlos Ramirez's cremated remains one last time before the funeral home worker in Caborca, Sonora, poured them into an electric grinder, pulverizing them into a white dust.</p>

<p>Ramirez and her family arrived in Caborca just before midnight. At the funeral home, a worker let them in. All of the rooms were dark except the entrance.</p>

<p>Before the cremation started, Ramirez and her family asked to see the body. When Martinez was 5 or 6, he fell climbing a pole and shattered his elbow. The metal pins used to repair his arm would prove beyond a doubt that the body belonged to Martinez.</p>

<p>Ramirez followed the worker to a back room, along with her sister, Reyna Martinez, 30; her aunt, Diana Canizales, 29; and her two uncles, Ricardo, 36, and Francisco, 40. Her mother, Elvira Canizales, 46, waited alone in one of the rooms.</p>

<p>When Ramirez returned, she and her sister were sobbing. They had asked for the body to be unwrapped from the head down, unable to bear looking at their brother's face. Ramirez and her sister were horrified by what they saw.</p>

<p>"He has no hands. He has no arms. He has no feet," Ramirez told her mother.</p>

<p>Unable to find the metal pins, they would have to trust the DNA results as confirmation that it was Martinez.</p>

<p>The funeral home worker slid the remains into a long metal tube lined with white bricks. The worker turned on the burners.</p>

<p>After nearly two hours, a metallic pounding sound came from the back of the funeral home. The family wandered outside to investigate. Across a concrete courtyard, the funeral home worker could be seen crushing smoldering bones with a metal pole inside a metal box.</p>

<p>After the bones had cooled, the worker poured them into an electric grinder, which crushed them into a white ash that wafted into the night air. He sealed the ashes in a plastic bag, placed it inside a wooden box decorated with a picture of the Virgin of Guadalupe, and screwed the box shut.</p>

<p>Descansa en Paz. Rest in peace</p>

<p>"I can't tell you I am relieved because I am not," Selene Ramirez said in September 2017 after the remains of her brother Carlos Martinez were identified through DNA tests. "My brother is dead." But in a way, she said, "it is relieving to at least be able to take him home."</p>

<p>By the time Ramirez and her family arrived in Cananea at 5 the next morning, dawn was breaking, silhouetting distant mountains in a pinkish glow. It happened to be Ramirez's 22nd birthday.</p>

<p>Family and neighbors, who had waited all night, wandered out of a two-room mobile home to greet them. The home, which belongs to Ramirez's mother, is on the edge of Cananea, overlooking a shimmering sea of tailings, refuse from the copper mine.</p>

<p>Martinez had lived here before he set out to cross the border.</p>

<p>Ramirez carried the box with her brother's ashes up three wobbly steps into the mobile home and walked across the cracked linoleum floor to a back corner. There she placed the box on a shelf and made a small altar with candles, a rosary and a Catholic statue of Jesus.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Ramirez gathered with her extended family outside the trailer. From the dirt driveway, mountains on the other side of the U.S.-Mexico border were visible, just 30 miles to the north.</p>

<p>Cradling the box in her arms, Ramirez led the group in a procession to a small Catholic church up the street.</p>

<p>Her aunt carried a framed photo of Martinez. In the photo, he is sitting on a porch, wearing a white T-shirt and a wry smile. "Descansa en Paz" — Rest in Peace — "Carlos Martinez," said words printed in Spanish on the photo.</p>

<p>On the day the photo was taken, Carlos had given himself a buzz cut. He had asked his youngest sister, Stephany, to take a picture with her cellphone while he posed on the porch with a cigarette in his hand.</p>

<p>During the Mass, the priest blessed the box containing Carlos' ashes.</p>

<p>But the priest made no mention of how Carlos died. Nor the conditions in Mexico that push people to cross illegally through the desert in search of a better life in the United States.</p>

<p>After the funeral Mass, Selene and her sister, Reyna, carried the box containing their brother's ashes back to their mother's home. The top of the box was wet with tears as family and friends lined up to pay their respects.</p>

<p>The next week, Ramirez returned to Phoenix, leaving her brother's ashes at her mother's home.</p>

<p>Over Christmas, she plans to return to Cananea to bring the box with the ashes back to Phoenix to complete the journey that claimed her brother's life.</p>

<p>"I think it will keep him at peace if we bring his remains to where he wanted to be," she said. "I don't want to leave him where he was so desperately trying to escape when he lost his life."</p>

<h2 id="locallawenforcementtalksbodycamerasinwakeofaclureport">Local law enforcement talks body cameras in wake of ACLU report</h2>

<p>by: RYAN PHILLIPS</p>

<p>West Point Police Chief Avery Cook (left) and Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott</p>

<p>DTL EDITOR</p>

<p>WEST POINT, MS</p>

<p>Body cameras have become an everyday part of the average law enforcement officer’s array of tools, but one organization claims the policies governing these devices in Mississippi fall well short of its recommendations.</p>

<p>The ACLU of Mississippi published a report this month titled “Strike The Right Balance: An Analysis of Body-Worn Camera Policies in Mississippi.”</p>

<p>The report touts the benefits of a statewide policy meant to standardize the use of body-worn cameras (BWCs) and also provides a model policy it hopes will be adopted by state lawmakers in the future to standardize the use of BWCs.</p>

<p>ACLU of Mississippi Executive Director Jennifer Riley Collins said when used properly, body-worn video cameras can help deter police misconduct and uses of force, provide evidence to hold officers accountable when misconduct does occur as well as exonerate wrongly accused officers, and help the public understand how police operate.</p>

<p>“The lack of uniformity across the state makes it clear that the state must establish certain minimum criteria for policies governing the use of BWCs by agencies choosing to deploy them,” Collins said.</p>

<p>Currently, individual law enforcement agencies in Mississippi are tasked with forming their own policies concerning the burgeoning technology, which typically mirrors that of other agencies with some minor changes in language.</p>

<p>ACLU REPORT</p>

<p>One of the key talking points from the report says of the 65 Mississippi law enforcement policies reviewed, none require individuals to be notified that they are being recorded; less than 20 percent require officers to deactivate the camera when entering a home where the resident requests the camera to be turned off and no policies provide provisions to protect victims of domestic violence.</p>

<p>Blake Feldman, the organization’s criminal justice reform advocacy coordinator, was the primary researcher and author of the report.</p>

<p>Feldman said for body cameras to promote trust between police and the community, police must use them in a way that balances interests in police accountability, government transparency and privacy.</p>

<p>“In the policies we analyzed, we found inconsistent implementation guidance, a lack of privacy safeguards, and bare minimum accountability provisions,” Feldman said.</p>

<p>Other issues brought up by the report claim of the 65 agencies analyzed, 3 percent of policies prohibit law enforcement from recording apparent victims and 40 percent grant a special right for officers to view footage before completing their report.</p>

<p>Neither the Clay County Sheriff’s Office or the West Point Police Department have express guidelines in their policies that prohibit officers from recording apparent victims.</p>

<p>For an example of how policies are implemented at the local level, the policy of the West Point Police Department - formed under then Chief Tim Brinkley - says officers should inform individuals that they are being recorded “whenever possible.”</p>

<p>The policy recommended by the ACLU states the officer “shall notify the subject(s) of the recording that they are being recorded by a body camera as close to the inception of the encounter as is reasonably possible.”</p>

<p>The WPPD policy also says in locations where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy - like a home - the subject may request the camera to be turned off unless the recording is being made in pursuant of an arrest or search of the property.</p>

<p>Similar language is used for the Clay County Sheriff’s Office policy, saying officers should notify individuals “whenever possible,” but does not require the action under the threat of punitive repercussions.</p>

<p>While the ACLU model policy addresses asking the occupant of a home where an officer is responding to a call if they would like the recording device cut off, no language is mentioned by the ACLU pertaining to if the recording is pursuant to an arrest or search of the property.</p>

<p>Both local agencies, however, require officers to activate body cameras to record all contacts with citizens in the performance of official duties. The language for both policies is exactly the same, but implementation of the policies differs between the two agencies.</p>

<p>LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WEIGH IN</p>

<p>One of the requirements of the model policy presented by the ACLU would require all body camera footage to be retained by the agency for six months from the date it was recorded, after which time it can be deleted.</p>

<p>Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott told the Daily Times Leader he is in favor of the use of body cameras, but said the biggest burden for his office comes in the form of data storage.</p>

<p>“The only issue is, just like every other agency, is storing,” Scott said. “The state leaves it to the county to have to fund it.”</p>

<p>The CCSO worked to steadily equip officers and patrol cars with recording devices and had outfitted the entire force with BWCs by late 2015.</p>

<p>Lack of storage capacity for footage at the CCSO is also compounded by the need to store dash camera video from patrol vehicles, along with body camera footage. Patrol officers typically work 12-hour shifts, which creates a glut of video footage that is of little use to the department if not used as part of a case.</p>

<p>Scott said his current policy is to keep everything that is related to a case or if a complaint against an officer is filed.</p>

<p>Typical footage with the CCSO is currently stored for about 30 to 45 days after being saved to the server and, if nothing comes up concerning a complaint, the footage is usually deleted to save storage space.</p>

<p>Another storage problem for Scott is a push for extended storage time.</p>

<p>“The problem is they come out and try to mandate a length of time,” Scott said. “How are we supposed to afford to do that? Are we supposed to lay off law enforcement officers? Those are the questions that need to come to the table.”</p>

<p>In cases involving capital punishment prosecutions, CCSO policy maintains the recordings be kept until the offender is no longer under control of a criminal justice agency. The policy for the WPPD states the exact same requirements.</p>

<p>Storage is also limited for the WPPD, with a 32-terabyte server used for storing video files. However, the department has its own internal methods of monitoring space to keep the server from being bogged down with data.</p>

<p>West Point Police Chief Avery Cook, who has been on the job since September, said storage “is not a problem” right now, because the department trusts its officers to turn on BWCs on a case-by-case basis, instead of with every interaction with the public.</p>

<p>“We only turn it on for major events when they need to save that stuff,” Cook said. “If it’s something we will need, we will download it on a hard drive and use it for court, and automatically after 30 days it rolls off and keeps storage clean.”</p>

<p>Both agencies also require data to be stored in accordance with state records retention laws and no longer than use for purposes of training or for use in an investigation or prosecution.</p>

<p>Scott and Cook - who was appointed to the position in July - both agreed smaller agencies would have a difficult time incorporating many of the changes being pushed by the ACLU concerning body cameras.</p>

<p>“I would say each department should make its own way and own policy,” Cook said.</p>

<p>The Daily Times Leader reported in March that since WPPD began using body cameras in September 2016 under Brinkley, the number of officer complaints has reduced drastically. Prior to implementing the cameras, WPPD received complaints at least once or twice a week.</p>

<p>While in favor of maintaining local autonomy in policy setting, Cook said he wasn’t opposed to the idea of a statewide policy putting every agency “on the same page.”</p>

<p>“A statewide policy wouldn’t be bad because everyone would be on the same guidelines,” Cook said. “I’m in favor of having our own policies. Most policies mirror others anyways.”</p>

<h2 id="lawenforcementlookstotheskyfortechnologicaladvantage">Law enforcement looks to the sky for technological advantage</h2>

<p>by: STEVE ROGERS</p>

<p>Law enforcement in the area is looking to improve its capabilities by incorporating drone technology</p>

<p>Staff Writer</p>

<p>WEST POINT, MS</p>

<p>Imagine a suspected drug dealer taking off on foot before investigators can get to him. A tracking dog gets on his scent but is about 10 minutes behind. By the time the dog leads officers to a hideout, the suspect already has gotten a ride and is gone.</p>

<p>That happened Thursday night in Clay County.</p>

<p>And if Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott and West Point Police Chief Avery Cook have their way, they'll join a small but growing number of emergency response agencies using technology to get an edge.</p>

<p>"This is just one more piece of technology out there we need to be using. We're foolish not to. It'll be one more piece of protection for the public," Sheriff Eddie Scott said of the efforts to buy an unmanned aerial system -- commonly known as a drone.</p>

<p>"We've got all kinds of potential uses. That search would be just one. If we'd had the drone, we might could have been out in front of the suspect, gotten a location or a car description or a tag number and been waiting for them," the sheriff added.</p>

<p>The departments hope to apply to groups as diverse as Homeland Security and the 4-County Electric Foundation to help pay the $10,000 price tag for the drone and the cameras, infrared equipment, night gear and other devices.</p>

<p>The two agencies also may use seized drug funds to cover the costs to avoid asking taxpayers for money.</p>

<p>Initially, the departments would work with the fleet of pilots in Mississippi State University's UAV program to get pilots for the drone. Eventually, deputies or officers would be certified to meet all Federal Aviation Administration standards to pilot the device.</p>

<p>MSU also will help the agencies get the necessary clearances from the FAA that now are required for law enforcement.</p>

<p>Searching for lost people, surveying storm damage, inspecting hazardous chemicals, surveillance on suspected drug houses, scouting out scenes before officers enter, checking crowds at events such as the Prairie Arts Festival, monitoring football games, aiding in water rescue are just a few of the potential uses, Scott mentioned.</p>

<p>"We'd also make it available to Oktibbeha or Lowndes counties, or Starkville or Columbus, the groups in our regional response teams," the sheriff said. "The highway patrol has a chopper that flies out of Jackson but if there is weather or it is somewhere else or it is down for repairs, we're out of luck. And our own drone would be much faster and more flexible. It wouldn't have to come from Jackson and a drone can get on top of things better," Scott explained.</p>

<p>"We just think it makes sense, especially when you've got rural areas like ours," he added, stressing the drone would only be used for approved law enforcement purposes and not for spying on people.</p>

<p>Nationwide, an estimated 500 police and fire departments and sheriff's departments have purchased drones in the last four years, most of those in the last two years.</p>

<p>The number is growing rapidly as their uses expand and now that federal regulations governing certification and piloting have been issued.</p>

<p>The Search and Rescue unit in neighboring Monroe County has three drones -- two for daytime flying and one for night. Since the agency got the drones in the last two years, they've been used to help find a missing child in Tennessee and catch a domestic violence suspect on Christmas Eve a year ago.</p>

<p>Among the others that were the first in the state to get the devices were the Adams County Sheriff's Department, Flowood Police Department, Calhoun County Emergency Management, and Gulfport Fire Department. Supervisors have authorized Scott to apply for grants and Selectmen are expected to follow suit with Scott.</p>

<p>If Dallas County officials are serious about reforming a cash bail system that leads to the unfair jailing of poor people, they need look no further than Biloxi, Miss.</p>

<p>This small casino and beach community was hit with a "debtor's prison" lawsuit similar to the one that the American Civil Liberties Union filed this week against Dallas County.</p>

<p>But Biloxi officials didn't fight it.</p>

<p>Instead, a day after the ACLU filed its suit in October 2015, Biloxi's city attorney at the time, former mayor Gerald Blessey, reached out to the organization to get to the bottom of its concerns and to stave off a potentially costly legal fight.</p>

<p>"The next day I called the ACLU lead counsel and said let's handle this in a professional way," Blessey said. "We made it clear we didn't think we had a debtor's prison."</p>

<p>Yet, the ACLU made it clear that Biloxi, like many cities and counties across America, had cultivated a criminal justice system that led to the arrest and jailing of poor people, often without legal representation or even a hearing. Those arrested were told they could avoid jail only if they paid the full amount of fees and court fines immediately and in cash.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs in the Biloxi case, Qumotria Kennedy and Joseph Anderson, were vivid examples of how the scheme worked. Kennedy, according to the ACLU, was tossed in jail for five nights following her arrest for failure to pay traffic fines. She wasn't informed of her right to legal counsel or afforded a court hearing to assess her ability to pay. Kennedy lost her part-time cleaning job because she missed work while behind bars.</p>

<p>Anderson was at home when police arrested him for failure to pay a traffic ticket. The disabled man was jailed for seven nights before he was taken before a magistrate. The judge failed to tell him that, as an indigent, he had right to a court-appointed attorney, according to the ACLU.</p>

<p>"It turned out [that] some people in the past in Biloxi had been allowed to sit in jail a few days because they were unable to pay," said Blessey.</p>

<p>Five months after the lawsuit was filed, the ACLU reached a settlement with Biloxi police and municipal court officials that led to sweeping reforms designed to protect the rights of poor people thrown in jail because they couldn't pay. Now, poor defendants not only are ensured proper hearings and representation, but can perform community service to offset fines and fees.</p>

<p>"Nobody in Biloxi goes to jail for a misdemeanor for an inability to pay," said Blessey, adding that the town's seen a reduction in fines as expected. "The purpose with municipal costs as with all courts is to do justice, not make money."</p>

<p>Many, if not all, of the key components of the settlement can be tailored or scaled to fix the problem in Dallas County.</p>

<p>The Biloxi settlement called for:</p>

<p>*Elimination of for-profit probation companies to collect court fines and fees.</p>

<p>*Adoption of clear court procedures and a "bench card" to guide judges on how to avoid sending poor or indigent defendants to jail because they're not able to pay fines and fees.</p>

<p>*Requiring judges to consider a person's ability to pay at sentencing prior to leveling burdensome fines and fees.</p>

<p>*Adopting of a standard for determining a person's ability to pay based on federal poverty guidelines and other factors.</p>

<p>*Establishment of a full-time public defender's office to represent indigent people at sentencing and when jail time or fines may be imposed, and at follow-up hearings concerning nonpayment of charges.</p>

<p>*Creation of payment plans, community service and programs in job-skills training, mental health counseling and drug treatment as alternatives to jail.</p>

<p>*Mandatory training for judges, court staff, police, prosecutors, public defenders and others involved in collecting fines and fees on Biloxi's new procedures and constitutional rights.</p>

<p>Dallas is doing some of these things, but it has failed to put in place a comprehensive and standardized set of measures, as the six defendants named in the ACLU's lawsuit attest.</p>

<p>The system remains too haphazard.</p>

<p>Exactly. Dallas officials knew they needed to bring an end to these practices after a federal ruling last year that slammed similar bail practices in Harris County. In that case, U.S. District Judge Lee Rosenthal declared that Harris County's practices were unconstitutional and ordered the release of all poor misdemeanor defendants within 24 hours of arrest.</p>

<p>But where's the urgency?</p>

<p>"This is a crisis that needs to be addressed immediately, and, unfortunately, it looks like a lawsuit is the only way to make that happen," said Trisha Trigilio, a senior attorney at the ACLU of Texas.</p>

<p>Dallas County officials seem to be banking on a strategy — risk-based assessments to determine who can pay fines — that the judge in the Harris County case already has taken to task. In his preliminary injunction ruling, Rosenthal said "wealth-based disparities" would continue under the new system since judges don't have to follow risk-based recommendations of release and poor defendants not deemed "low-risk" remain stuck in jail.</p>

<p>Dallas would be wise to step back and take a look at what Biloxi's doing.</p>

<p>"It's become a model," said Blessey. "We found the ACLU to be very professional and willing to work with us once they found we wanted to do the right thing."</p>

<h2 id="spikestripk9droneusedtoapprehendfleeingsuspectingreenfield">Spike strip, K-9, drone used to apprehend fleeing suspect in Greenfield</h2>

<p>by: Elliot Hughes</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-11</p>

<p>GREENFIELD - A spike strip, a K-9 unit, a thermal-vision drone and officers from five law-enforcement agencies were all deployed to help stop a fleeing vehicle early Thursday morning, April 12, in Greenfield.</p>

<p>The pursuit began at about 2:39 a.m. when a Walworth County sheriff’s deputy pulled over a silver Kia Korte on Interstate 43 near the Waukesha County border for not having registration plates. After verbally identifying himself to the deputy, the suspect fled the scene, reaching speeds as high as 113 mph, according to Capt. Dave Gerber of the Walworth County Sheriff’s Office.</p>

<p>The suspect proceeded into Waukesha County, where New Berlin police joined the pursuit and deflated the vehicle’s tires by using a spike strip, according to the New Berlin Police Department. Despite the flat tires, the vehicle continued down the interstate until it crashed into a road construction sign near 116th Street in Greenfield.</p>

<p>The suspect then fled on foot, according to police. Greenfield officers deployed a drone, but it was a canine officer from the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department's K-9 unit that found the suspect hiding in a nearby yard and bit him. The suspect suffered minor injuries.</p>

<p>Officers took a 20-year-old Mississippi man into custody, according to Sgt. Dan Hanlon of the New Berlin Police Department. The incident remains under investigation; charges are still pending.</p>

<p>Capt. Ray Radakovich, of the Greenfield Police Department, said his agency purchased the thermal-vision drone four months ago. It is primarily used to map out crime scenes and take photos, he said.</p>

<p>Officials from the Greenfield Fire Department, Hales Corners Police Department and Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office also responded to the incident, according to a news release from New Berlin police.</p>

Christopher Patton was a Jackson Public Schools Bus Driver who was arrested for allegedly committing sexual assault against an elementary school student in early December. WLBT reported he was charged with gratification of lust and sexual battery. </p>

<p>County Court Judge Bill Skinner refused to set bond for Patton but ruled (per a standing order from Judge Green). However, he decreed that he must "appear at a bond review hearing before" Judge Green if he was not indicted by May 1. Judge Skinner's February 1 order stated that he could not be released until he appeared before Judge Green.</p>

<p>The Senior Circuit Judge reviewed Patton's detention and reduced his bond to $50,000 and placed him on house arrest with a 10:00 curfew. She said he had been incarcerated without bond for 193 days but had not been indicted.</p>

<p>The Hinds County website states that Patton is still in custody at the Raymond Detention Center. It is not known if Patton is related to the former British Governor of Hong Kong.</p>

<p>JPD Chief Anthony Moore is out. The new Chief is James Davis. Chief Davis served as Deputy Chief under Chief Moore and Chief of Patrol Operations under Chief Lee Vance.</p>

<p>Chief Moore had never been a supervisor and at times it was quite clear he was in over his head. Crime stats on the city website had not been updated since November. The weekly Comstat meetings were reduced as he held them bi-weekly. Even with a reduced schedule, it was not uncommon for Chief Moore to cancel Comstat meetings. The number of homicides is no longer included in homicide press releases.</p>

<p>This will be the third police chief for Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba in less than a year. One hopes that JPD will get a relief from the merry-go-round at the top position and achieve some stability.</p>

<h2 id="billcrawfordmississippileadersdontstanduptotrump">Bill Crawford: Mississippi Leaders Don't Stand Up to Trump</h2>

<p>Trump tariffs and retaliatory tariffs are no big deal for Mississippi say key Republican leaders. "Everything will work out," is their mantra.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump tariffs kicked in June 1st on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) imports from the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. Mexico imposed retaliatory tariffs on June 5th, Canada will on July 1st, and the EU will later in July. Trump also is moving to impose 25% tariffs on an array of China exports. China promised quick retaliation.</p>

<p>“I do not think there will be a trade war,” Sen. Roger Wicker told the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, expressing confidence that "the end result will be better opportunities for Mississippi businesses, farmers and consumers.” Rep. Trent Kelly said, "Now is the time for patience and to let the president do his job and negotiate on behalf of the American people.” Gov. Phil Bryant said, "“President Trump puts American workers and businesses first, and his policies continue to bear that out,” pointing to Mississippi's low unemployment.</p>

<p>Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith showed some concern. She told the Meridian Star Trump tariffs could hurt the state in the short term, but believed Trump's efforts could be beneficial in the long term.</p>

<p>Business leaders aren't as sanguine about Trump tariffs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce expressed concern that 2.6 million American jobs could be at risk. The defense industry expressed concern about increased costs for steel and aluminum and the impact on global supply chains and risks to exports. The U.S. Farm Bureau expressed serious concerns to Congressional committees.</p>

<p>Mississippians should be concerned too.</p>

<p>The Daily Journal reported $113 million in goods exported from Mississippi to Canada at risk from tariffs, adding those exports come from nearly 2,200 Mississippi-based companies about 77% of which were small- and medium-sized enterprises with fewer than 500 employees.</p>

<p>Mississippi's $1.1 billion dollar soybean industry would be affected by retaliatory tariffs. More than 110 million bushels were produced in the state in 2017 from 3,274 farms. About half are exported, mostly to China, the European Union, Japan, Mexico and Taiwan. In general, farmers worry that retaliatory tariffs will make the things they grow sell for less and steel and aluminum tariffs will make the things they buy cost more.</p>

<p>Mississippi’s growing tire and automobile sector is at risk from steel tariffs and retaliatory auto tariffs. Even Mississippi's emerging brewery industry would be impacted, according to Lucas Simmons, president of Lucky Town Brewing Company in Jackson.</p>

<p>Republican leaders from other states are standing up to Trump on tariffs. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told fellow Kentuckians, as reported by CNN, "I hope we pull back from the brink here because these tariffs will not be good for the economy." House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin said, "I disagree with this decision." Others speaking out include House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas, Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Sen. Ben Sasse, of Nebraska, Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, and Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>You'd think Mississippi Republican leaders would be standing up too, instead of timidly hoping Trump is just bluffing to gain trade concessions.</p>

<p>Rankin County Circuit Judge John Emfinger denied a convicted baby-killer's petition to restore his gun rights last month.</p>

<p>Joshua Poling was indicted for capital murder in Rankin County for the 2005 death of his son, 8-month old James Poling. (The obituary for little James is posted below.) He pleaded guilty to manslaughter due to culpable negligence in December, 2007. Circuit Judge Samac Richardson sentenced Poling to a prison term of twenty years, but gave him credit for time served. Poling served over two years in the Rankin County jail since he could not post bond of $500,000. The Mississippi Department of Corrections granted Earned Supervised Release to Poling on September 20, 2014. He did not have to apply for parole.</p>

<p>Poling filed a petition for certificate of rehabilitation in Rankin County Circuit Court on July 13, 2017. Judge Emfinger was a Rankin County Assistant District Attorney when the case was prosecuted. Oddly enough, the Clarion-Ledger reported Poling's arrest but did not report his indictment nor conviction.</p>

<p>Judge Emfinger said that although the law does not require a "waiting period" before the certificate can be issued, he would not consider doing so unless Poling was eligible for expungement. Poling can't apply for expungement until five years after his release (in two years).</p>

<p>Update: WE GOT A TAPE!!!</p>

<p>Attorney Bridgette Morgan claims she was fired from her Hinds County Public Defender position because she qualified to run against Hinds County Court Judge Melvin Priester, Sr. Ms. Morgan made the allegation in lawsuit that was filed today in U.S. District Court. The defendants are Hinds County and Chief Public Defender Michelle Purvis Harris.</p>

<p>Ms. Morgan was a Hinds County Public Defender when she qualified to run against Judge Priester on May 11. The complaint claims Michele Purvis Harris that she was being terminated effective immediately.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Plaintiff asked Ms. Harris to provide an explanation as to why she was being terminated, and Ms. Harris' reply was, "Well because you serve at the will and pleasure of the Public Defender. So I really don't have to give you a reason." Defendant Harris then claimed that Plaintiff was self-centered, selfish, deceitful and disrespectful.</p></li>

<li><p>After being rebuffed with no explanation and then a vague explanation, Plaintiff decided to directly ask Michele Harris if the reason for her termination was due to the fact that Plaintiff had decided to run for the position of Hinds County Court Judge.</p></li>

<li><p>Ms. Harris' reply was, "I would say that is the straw that broke the camel's back."</p></li>

<li><p>Ms. Harris directly admitted that Plaintiff's decision to run for the position of Hinds County Court Judge was the motivating factor in Plaintiff's termination.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ms. Morgan argues her termination violated her First Amendment rights. The complaint is posted below.</p>

<p>The case is assigned to Judge Henry Wingate and Magistrate Linda Anderson.</p>

<p>A Hinds County Public Defender advocate abolishing the police. Mr. Adofo Minka, Esquire wrote in the Black Agenda Report:</p>

<p>For those who may be confused, we must be clear. Pointing to Laurel Police Department’s swift punitive actions against the officers who violated Barrett’s human rights is not an endorsement of LPD or any law enforcement agency. Swift punishment for officers who violate the constitutional and human rights of civilians should be par for the course. There is no model police department because in our eyes, such an entity represents a fiction that flies in the face of our political principles and ideology as revolutionaries. Our position is clear. LPD, JPD and every other law enforcement agency throughout this country and internationally needs to be disarmed and abolished. From their inception, they have been used as an occupying force and means of social control of the popular masses and a personal military force and buffer for the wealthy ruling class elites who steal the labor and build wealth on the backs of the popular masses. We simply use the situation in Laurel to pull the covers off of a municipal government administration that claims to be the most radical on the planet, but in actuality it is not even the most “radical” in the central Mississippi region when it comes to holding police accountable to the human rights principles of accountability, transparency, equity, universality and participation.</p>

<p>Wrestling returns, except this time it will be a Battle Royal with Othor Cain, Ben Allen, Kim Wade, Haley Fisackerly, Alan Lange, and “Big Cat” Donna Ladd all in the ring at the same time. The Battle Royal will be in a steel cage, no time limit, no referee, and the losers must leave town. Marshand Crisler will be the honorary referee (as it gives him a title without actually having to do anything). </p>

<p>Meet KIM Waaaaaade at the Entergy Tent. For five pesos, Kim will sell you a chance to win a deed to a crack house on Ridgeway Street stuffed in the Howard Industries pinata. Don't worry if the pinata is beaten to shreds, as Mr. Wade has Jose, Emmanuel, and Carlos, all illegal immigrants, available as replacements for the it. Upon leaving the Entergy tent, fig leaves will be available in case Entergy literally takes everything you have as part of its Trollfest ticket price adjustment charge.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd of The Jackson Free Press will give several classes on learning how to write. Smearing, writing without factchecking, and reporting only one side of a story will be covered. A donation to pay their taxes will be accepted and she will be signing copies of their former federal tax liens.

"Why everything is always about me" and "Why I cover murders better than anyone else in Jackson".</p>

<p>In the spirit of helping those who are less fortunate, Trollfest '09 adopts a cause for which a portion of the proceeds and donations will be donated: Keeping Frank Melton in his home. The “Keep Frank Melton From Being Homeless” booth will sell chances for five dollars to pin the tail on the jackass. John Reeves has graciously volunteered to be the jackass for this honorable excursion into saving Frank's ass. What's an ass between two friends after all? If Mr. Reeves is unable to um, perform, Speaker Billy McCoy has also volunteered as when the word “jackass” was mentioned he immediately ran as fast as he could to sign up. </p>

<p>In order to help clean up the legal profession, Adam Kilgore of the Mississippi Bar will be giving away free, round-trip plane tickets to the North Pole where they keep their bar complaint forms (which are NOT available online). If you don't want to go to the North Pole, you can enjoy Brant Brantley's (of the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance) free guided tours of the quicksand field over by High Street where all complaints against judges disappear. If for some reason you are unable to control yourself, never fear; Judge Houston Patton will operate his jail where no lawyers are needed or allowed as you just sit there for minutes... hours.... months...years until he decides he is tired of you sitting in his jail. Do not think Judge Patton is a bad judge however as he plans to serve free Mad Dog 20/20 to all inmates.</p>

<p>Trollfest '09 is a pet-friendly event as well. Feel free to bring your dog with you and do not worry if your pet gets hungry, as employees of the Jackson Zoo will be on hand to provide some of their animals as food when it gets to be feeding time for your little loved one.</p>

<h2 id="judgetosecsosnosofastmyfriend">Judge to SEC &amp; SOS: No So Fast, My Friend</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-06-01</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/06/judge-in-lamar-adams-case-no-so-fast-my.html </p>

<p>Affirmative action meets the Lamar Adams case. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled yesterday that he will appoint a receiver in the Lamar Adams case that meets minority-hiring goals established by the Court. The SEC and Secretary of State Eggbert Hosemann are fighting over the right to appoint a receiver in the Lamar Adams Ponzi scheme case.</p>

<p>The SEC accused Adams of operating a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 150 investors out of more than $85 million since 2005, in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court on April 20. The SEC said Adams sold bogus timber rights and deeds guaranteeing 13% interest rates. Mr. Adams pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to one count of wire fraud. The Justice Department said in that case Adams defrauded 250 investors of more than $100 million.</p>

<p>The SEC asked U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves to appoint a temporary receiver for Lamar Adams and his company Madison Timber Properties. in an emergency motion submitted on April 10. The SEC argued a receiver was needed so the defendants' assets could be "preserved" for distribution to the victims. The request states that a receiver will submit a report within 60 days stating how the assets will be distributed to the victims. The Commission also argued the assets gained through the fraud should be protected from a "race to the courthouse" since some victims are filing lawsuits.</p>

<p>However, Secretary of State Dibbit Hosemann opposed the SEC's motion to appoint a receiver. Mr. Hosemann said the defendants are Mississippi citizens, as well as a large number of the victims. The alleged violations are also violations of the Mississippi Securities Act. He asked the court to appoint Derek Henderson as receiver. Mr. Henderson is a bankruptcy trustee in Jackson.</p>

<p>However, Judge Reeves threw a wrench into their arguments with his new requirement. He justified his ruling by accusing the federal judiciary of lacking diversity:</p>

<p>The Court believes that particular care is necessary in appointing officers of the federal judiciary, an institution that fails to reflect the diversity of the public it serves. Just one in five Article III judges are people of color, and only one in three are women. Since 2017, less than one in ten people appointed as Article III judges have been people of color, and less than one in four have been women. Bankruptcy and magistrate judges appointed by the judiciary are even less diverse, and people of color are hired for just one in six clerkship positions in multi-district litigation, fewer than one in five leadership positions are filled by women. </p>

<p>The Reuben Anderson protege then turned his ire towards the legal profession itself:</p>

<p>The same lack of diversity defines the broader legal profession. Despite making up a quarter of the country, people of color represent just one in ten lawyers, and only a third of lawyers are women. At major law firms, fewer than one in ten partners are people of color, and fewer than one in four partners are women.</p>

<p>and of course remembered he is in Mississippi, after all:</p>

<p>Deeper patterns of exclusion appear in Mississippi. While black people make up 40% of the population, they represent fewer than 16% of Mississippi’s federal bankruptcy, circuit, district, and magistrate judges. One survey found that fewer than 4% of federal clerks hired in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas were black.11 People of color represent fewer than 11% of the Mississippi bar. Women make up fewer than 16% of Mississippi’s federal bankruptcy, circuit, district, and magistrate judges, and just 23% of the state’s lawyers.</p>

<p>Judge Reeves then turns to the case at hand:</p>

<p>Still, when given the opportunity, courts should take steps to increase their diversity. Justice is a search for truth. That search will fail if a court does not incorporate a wide array of experiences, facts, and perspectives into its decision-making processes. “The case for diversity is especially compelling for the judiciary,” as District Judge Edward M. Chen has said. “How can the public have confidence and trust in such an institution if it is segregated – if the communities it is supposed to protect are excluded from its ranks?” To deliver justice and ensure its legitimacy, then, the judiciary must diversify itself.</p>

<p>In fulfilling that duty here, the Court will use the “inherent power” courts have “to provide themselves with appropriate instruments required for the performance of their duties.” The Court will require the Receiver to take steps to guarantee that its hiring practices are as inclusive as possible, ensuring the participation of those who have traditionally been excluded from legal work in America. Applicants are encouraged to commit to bold and creative steps involving recruiting, retaining, hiring, and other staffing concerns in their applications. Through their fulfillment, those steps may aim for - though may not guarantee achievement of - targets for billable hours performed by those underrepresented in the legal profession. Even steps that aim for very modest targets, such as 25% of hours being conducted by women and 20% of hours being conducted by people of color, would be laudable.</p>

<p>The Court posted a receivership application online. A copy is posted below.</p>

<p>Kingfish note: For someone who is so concerned about discrimination, Judge Reeves has not bothered to rule on the Hinds County 2012 redistricting case even though a hearing was held over three years ago. Judge Reeves knows that Robert Graham, Doug Anderson, George Smith, and Derrick Johnson engaged in some good ole fashioned racial discrimination that is known all too well in Mississippi. However, he can't bring himself to rule on the case because he can't justify a ruling upholding such blatant discrimination that would not be reversed on appeal. </p>

<p>If anyone thinks the Kingfish is being too hard on Judge Reeves, read this earlier post that reported how the Fifth Circuit <strong>_</strong>-slapped Judge Reeves after he blatantly tried to rig the results in a reverse-discrimination case. The Fifth Circuit panel literally laughed out of court the side favored by Judge Reeves.</p>

<p>Judge Reeves used such reasoning in striking down 1523 only to be slapped down himself by the higher courts. Apparently he learned nothing and forgot everything from that experience.</p>

<h2 id="empowermississippitobillcrawfordschoolchoicenotanentitlementbutprekis">Empower Mississippi to Bill Crawford: School Choice not an Entitlement but Pre-K is.</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-05-31</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/06/empower-mississippi-to-bill-crawford.html </p>

<p>Empower Mississippi's Grant Callen submitted this column in response to Bill Crawford's column last Sunday about Empower Mississippi's promotion of school choice. </p>

<p>Earlier this week, columnist Bill Crawford penned a piece arguing that school choice proposals authored in recent legislative sessions are not conservative because they represent a “new entitlement.” Instead, Crawford favors publicly funded Pre-K as the best fix for Mississippi’s public education woes.</p>

<p>Here’s why he’s wrong.</p>

<p>To be a new entitlement the Legislature would have to appropriate more money for school choice than it already does for K-12 education. Yet school choice does not require more money – it simply proposes that taxpayers get more bang for their buck with existing funds.</p>

<p>Choice proposals transfer decision-making power to parents and subscribe to the conservative principle that people closest to a problem are the best people to fix it.</p>

<p>Many happily choose traditional public schools, but that choice is largely reserved for those who can afford it. Low-income families who lack the resources to move to neighborhoods with better schools or pay for private school tuition are often trapped in a school someone else chose for them.</p>

<p>School choice levels the playing field, promoting equality of opportunity for all.</p>

<p>What could be more appealing to political conservatives…or liberals…than that?</p>

<p>School choice also introduces a healthy dose of competition into a system with all the problems of a monopoly, namely that overwhelmed operators can get away with offering a mediocre, poor, or even abysmal education because many of their customers can’t go elsewhere.</p>

<p>Crawford argues that increased funding won’t fix public education. On this point we agree. This debate is all about who can spend tax dollars already earmarked for your child’s education more thoughtfully – you or someone tasked with serving every child? About who deserves the freedom to pivot and make a different choice when necessary – you or someone who doesn’t know your child at all?</p>

<p>The idea that public school students will lose in a competitive environment is not only ludicrous but handily disproven by the evidence. An expansive body of gold standard empirical research demonstrates that school choice programs not only benefit the students who opt out of public school, but also those students who stay.</p>

<p>School choice programs across the nation and here in Mississippi are producing more satisfied parents, more successful students, and higher expectations for all schools, both private and public. Yes, students perform better academically, but they also persist and graduate at higher rates, find good jobs, and stay out of prison. </p>

<p>For them, the American dream looks attainable. Why not give all students the same hope, regardless of socioeconomic status or their zip code?</p>

<p>Furthermore, in a choice-friendly environment, everyone – students, parents, administrators, teachers, and innovators – benefits from the increased interest in quality and focus on true accountability.</p>

<p>Now, what about Crawford’s preference for public Pre-K? Whether or not you agree with his claims about its advantages, one fact remains: Creating a public Pre-K program in Mississippi would cost millions and millions of new tax dollars while ignoring altogether the issues plaguing K-12 public education. And if that’s not a new entitlement, I don’t know what is.</p>

<p>School choice is not a silver bullet, but it offers the most promise for the least money and the least amount of effort. It relies on the money, decisionmakers, entrepreneurial spirit, and market forces already in place and has the potential to make a difference in the lives of young Americans from day one.</p>

<p>Wrestling returns, except this time it will be a Battle Royal with Othor Cain, Ben Allen, Kim Wade, Haley Fisackerly, Alan Lange, and “Big Cat” Donna Ladd all in the ring at the same time. The Battle Royal will be in a steel cage, no time limit, no referee, and the losers must leave town.

<p>Meet KIM Waaaaaade at the Entergy Tent. For five pesos, Kim will sell you a chance to win a deed to a crack house on Ridgeway Street stuffed in the Howard Industries pinata. Don't worry if the pinata is beaten to shreds, as Mr. Wade has Jose, Emmanuel, and Carlos, all illegal immigrants, available as replacements for the it.

<p>Donna Ladd of The Jackson Free Press will give several classes on learning how to write. Smearing, writing without factchecking, and reporting only one side of a story will be covered.

"Why everything is always about me" and "Why I cover murders better than anyone else in Jackson".</p>

<p>In the spirit of helping those who are less fortunate, Trollfest '09 adopts a cause for which a portion of the proceeds and donations will be donated: Keeping Frank Melton in his home. The “Keep Frank Melton From Being Homeless” booth will sell chances for five dollars to pin the tail on the jackass. John Reeves has graciously volunteered to be the jackass for this honorable excursion into saving Frank's ass. What's an ass between two friends after all? If Mr. Reeves is unable to um, perform, Speaker Billy McCoy has also volunteered as when the word “jackass” was mentioned he immediately ran as fast as he could to sign up. </p>

<p>In order to help clean up the legal profession, Adam Kilgore of the Mississippi Bar will be giving away free, round-trip plane tickets to the North Pole where they keep their bar complaint forms (which are NOT available online). If you don't want to go to the North Pole, you can enjoy Brant Brantley's (of the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance) free guided tours of the quicksand field over by High Street where all complaints against judges disappear. If for some reason you are unable to control yourself, never fear; Judge Houston Patton will operate his jail where no lawyers are needed or allowed as you just sit there for minutes... hours.... months...years until he decides he is tired of you sitting in his jail. Do not think Judge Patton is a bad judge however as he plans to serve free Mad Dog 20/20 to all inmates.</p>

<p>Trollfest '09 is a pet-friendly event as well. Feel free to bring your dog with you and do not worry if your pet gets hungry, as employees of the Jackson Zoo will be on hand to provide some of their animals as food when it gets to be feeding time for your little loved one.</p>

<p>Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba put M.A.C. owner Marcus Wallace in his place Tuesday night. Mr. Wallace simultaneously be-clowned himself and made an ass out of himself during the public comments period. Watch the video posted below.</p>

<p>An error occurred.</p>

<p>Try watching this video on www.youtube.com, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace wanted to talk about facts. Well, the fact is BOTH investigations are incomplete. The Mayor said that the city took responsibility for the actions of JPD and Public Works after citizens notified the city of the manhole problems on Ridgewood Road that morning. Mayor Lumumba said at his press conference Monday that the failure of the manhole itself was still under investigation. The John Knight incident is still under investigation as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace did respond to the Mayor on Facebook:</p>

<p>Yesterday I presented some facts at the city council mtg that the Mayor felt the need to be combative on. Well, its obvious that someone realized that it wasn't such a good decision to do that because all the facts I stated can be proven because its mighty strange that the audio on the council mtg was cut off on our heated discussion. I have put a lot of time, energy and resources into the city of Jackson, the town of Edwards and Western Hinds County over the last 20 yrs. I have personally took time away from my children to help raise other children in this city so I take it very personal when someone trys to defame my character and minimize my business and as much as I care and the passion I have for children black and white and to accuse me of using the little white girl's tragic death to get a contract or make money was the lowest and unprofessional accusation to make on someone who proves day in and day out what he's about. How the hell I'm trying to make money off her death when I stated over 6-8 months ago that someone was going to get hurt. So one way or another the Lord is going to make sure the citizens in this city hear the audio on what took place last nite. Its obvious that you're listening to all the wrong people, you're combative on every issue, you're cocky, you have no concern of the people or the businesses in the inner city and you're running the city like a mom and pop store. People like but stats don't. All the council has to do is get the shovel and start digging and they will see for themselves what is going on. Citizens, stay tuned.... Its gametime!!! Let's play ball!</p>

<p>since companies who are getting these millions of dollars of projects without contracts are the ones who feeding you all this info it's very obvious who you are listening to. To state publicly that I'm trying to capitalize off the young lady's death was actually very low my brother. Its obvious you haven't done your research cause the passion and love I have for the children in this city has not gone unnoticed. I have begged and begged for months to do something about these holes in the streets. I took my personal funds and bought equipment to help solve this problem and for this child to die and someone local had the equipment to work on this problem shows how unsavvy you are as a leader.</p>

<p>You've talked to John Knight a few times but you havent said to much of nothing. All he know is that his son our son was beaten and there's no record or report an officer calling the license or tag in. That's fact!!! Stay tuned for Part 4...</p>

<p>Kingfish note: Why did Mr. Wallace feel the need to say "white" in "little white girl's tragic death" in his Facebook post? Does it have anything to do with anything?</p>

<p>Mr. Wallace should post a picture of his certification on Facebook.</p>

<h2 id="pelahatchiemayornotifiedstateauditorofdrugmoneymisspending">Pelahatchie Mayor notified State Auditor of drug money misspending</h2>

<p>by: Kingfish</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-21</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/05/pelahatchie-mayor-notified-state.html </p>

<p>Pelahatchie Mayor Ryshonda Beechem issued the following statement. </p>

<p>Mayor Ryshonda Beechem's first day in office was July 1, 2017. In the days that followed, the City Clerk presented the Mayor with checks to sign on behalf of the City, indicating that they needed to be signed right away because 'bills were due' and that the Board had 'already approved the expenditures at the board meeting.' The Mayor was initially under the impression that this was normal procedure, and signed what she understood to be checks for the City's bills for July and August, 2017.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, the Mayor became suspicious as to the City's bookkeeping methods, and also took notice of the 'drug fund account.' The Mayor researched and found the relevant Mississippi statute dealing with how seized monies were to be spent, and showed it to the board members. In response, the Board refused to change their practices. In September 2017, the Pelahatchie City Attorney provided the Mayor with a copy of a research memo he prepared which concluded that, in his opinion, "All money disbursed or used from the Police Seizure Fund, was done so properly, and in accordance with State and Federal Law." The Mayor resisted, stating the usage of the drug fund account in this manner appears to violate the law.</p>

<p>When the Board and City Clerks continued to request the Mayor to sign checks of this nature, she contacted the State Auditor for clarification on the issues. She was instructed to contact investigations at that point. The Mayor complied with all requests made of her by the State Auditor's office relative to the investigation.</p>

<h2 id="stateauditordrugmoneymisspentdemandissuedtopelahatchieofficialsford502363">State Auditor: Drug Money misspent. Demand issued to Pelahatchie officials for $502,363</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-05-20</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/05/state-auditor-drug-money-misspent.html </p>

<p>State Auditor Stacey Pickering issued the following statement.</p>

<p>Today, special agents from the Mississippi Office of the State Auditor (OSA) delivered civil demands to several current and former officials in the Town of Pelahatchie. Drug seizure funds, which are required to be used for law enforcement purposes, were misspent by the Town. Two demands were issued for a total $502,363.07, which includes interest and investigative costs.</p>

<p>Mississippi law requires the transfer of all funds received through the forfeiture proceedings under the Uniform Controlled Substance Law into the budget of the corresponding law enforcement agency. A review of Pelahatchie’s Forfeiture Account shows this transfer did not occur. After an OSA investigation, several illegal transfers were discovered. Some of the illegal transfers relate to:</p>

<p>· Transfers to the Town’s Enterprise Account (Utility Account)</p>

<p>· Transfers to the Town’s Special Fire Fund</p>

<p>· Transfers made to prevent overdraft in the regular Town checking account</p>

<p>· Transfers to pay salaries of non-police department employees</p>

<p>· Transfers to pay for items not associated with the Pelahatchie Police Department in any way</p>

<p>In Mississippi, asset forfeiture has a dual purpose of discouraging drug trafficking and providing a direct benefit to law enforcement agencies across the State. The goal of asset forfeiture is to provide police departments with additional funds to spend on equipment, additional training, officer overtime payment, and salary to hire new officers. The intent is to provide citizens with a better equipped and more qualified police department.</p>

<p>The first demand, totaling $421,688.10, represents the period of January 2015 to June 2017. It was issued to: former mayor, Knox Ross, Jr.; former alderman, Jerry Norwood; former alderwoman, Megan Hall; former city clerk, Bettye Massey; current alderman, Frank Boyd; current alderman, Michael Adams; and current alderwoman, Margie Warren. All recipients of this demand are jointly responsible for its repayment.</p>

<p>The second demand, totaling $80,694.97, represents the period from July 2017 to December 2017. It was issued to: former city clerk, Bettye Massey; current mayor, Ryshonda Beechem; current alderman, Eddie Jones; current alderman, Frank Boyd; current alderman, James Harrell; current alderman, Michael Adams; current alderwoman, Margie Warren. All recipients of this demand are jointly responsible for its repayment.</p>

<p>State Auditor Stacey Pickering said, “For years, the leadership of Pelahatchie abused these funds by attempting to use them to enhance the overall city budget when they were mandated to be allocated to the Pelahatchie Police Department. OSA will continue to work to assist local governments when questions regarding proper use of public funds arise, but we will also ensure that misspent money is recovered on behalf of Mississippians.”</p>

<p>Kingfish note: Now what was it the city attorney said? He had looked at this and there was nothing wrong?</p>

<p>Now let's look at some of the comments made in past posts about Pelahatchie:</p>

<p>Word on the street is this witch hunt audit isn't going the way that Pickerings office wants it to and his office is leaking stuff to various sources, for what reasons I do not know. Also, Betty was going to resign right after the last elections, hell she's 70, but the new mayor made it known she was going after some folks in retaliation for her mothers "termination" as well as trying to destroy the town and Mrs. Betty wanted to stay and help protect her town. She is not retiring over this I can assure you. January 22, 2018 at 8:36 AM </p>

<p>I think stacey’s Office did an investigation earlier and it’s still much to do about nothing. This was with the drug money stuff kingfish reported on a while back and still nothing has come about it. Per the article On 1-24, KF reported Pickering Office would have an announcement “next month”. On 5-17-18(several “next months” later), there has yet to be a big announcement. Ryshonda Be barking up the wrong tree. May 17, 2018 at 10:42 AM </p>

<p>KF, Can you push the Auditor for the results of the misappropriation of the drug money? Hopefully he is auditing the entire PD to find where the money went. Mayor may wish she hadn't opened this can of worms. February 8, 2018 at 10:25 AM </p>

<p>Word on the street is the auditor hasn't found anything with substance and someone is "leaking" this to some media outlets to turn it into a race thing versus what it is. Lots more going on in sleepy Pelahatchie than what's being reported. February 8, 2018 at 3:22 PM </p>

<p>Deputies and canines were conducting “sniffs” of inbound luggage. All three canines alerted on three large suitcases. Rankin County Sheriff’s Investigator Brad Smith obtained a search warrant for the bags from Rankin County Justice Court Judge Josh McCrory. A search of the bags revealed approximately 70 pounds of hydroponic marijuana in vacuum sealed bags wrapped in clothing.</p>

<p>Rankin County Deputies along with Airport Police observed a male subject pick up two of the bags at baggage terminal. Officers moved in and arrested the male suspect. The suspect is identified as Mario Maurice GEORGE. GEORGE was arrested for trafficking of marijuana and was transported to the Rankin County Jail.</p>

<p>The retail value of the marijuana is approximately $300,000.00.</p>

<p>Mario Maurice GEORGE will appear before District Attorney Michael Guest and Rankin County Court Judge Kent McDaniel’s for an initial appearance. No bond has been set at this time.</p>

<p>The marijuana is believed to have originated from Los Angeles and was intended to be delivered and distributed in the Jackson Metro Area.</p>

<p>This investigation continues and more arrests are expected.</p>

<p>Trollfest '07 was such a success that Jackson Jambalaya will once again host Trollfest '09. Catch this great event which will leave NE Jackson &amp; Fondren in flames. Othor Cain and his band, The Black Power Structure headline the night while Sonjay Poontang returns for an encore performance. Former Frank Melton bodyguard Marcus Wright makes his premier appearance at Trollfest singing "I'm a Sweet Transvestite" from "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." Kamikaze will sing his new hit, “How I sold out to da Man.” Robbie Bell again performs: “Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be Bells” and “Any friend of Ed Peters is a friend of mine”. After the show, Ms. Bell will autograph copies of her mug shot photos.

<p>Wrestling returns, except this time it will be a Battle Royal with Othor Cain, Ben Allen, Kim Wade, Haley Fisackerly, Alan Lange, and “Big Cat” Donna Ladd all in the ring at the same time. The Battle Royal will be in a steel cage, no time limit, no referee, and the losers must leave town. Marshand Crisler will be the honorary referee (as it gives him a title without actually having to do anything). </p>

<p>Meet KIM Waaaaaade at the Entergy Tent. For five pesos, Kim will sell you a chance to win a deed to a crack house on Ridgeway Street stuffed in the Howard Industries pinata. Don't worry if the pinata is beaten to shreds, as Mr. Wade has Jose, Emmanuel, and Carlos, all illegal immigrants, available as replacements for the it. Upon leaving the Entergy tent, fig leaves will be available in case Entergy literally takes everything you have as part of its Trollfest ticket price adjustment charge.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd of The Jackson Free Press will give several classes on learning how to write. Smearing, writing without factchecking, and reporting only one side of a story will be covered. A donation to pay their taxes will be accepted and she will be signing copies of their former federal tax liens.

The “Keep Frank Melton From Being Homeless” booth will sell chances for five dollars to pin the tail on the jackass. John Reeves has graciously volunteered to be the jackass for this honorable excursion into saving Frank's ass. What's an ass between two friends after all? If Mr. Reeves is unable to um, perform, Speaker Billy McCoy has also volunteered as when the word “jackass” was mentioned he immediately ran as fast as he could to sign up. </p>

<p>In order to help clean up the legal profession, Adam Kilgore of the Mississippi Bar will be giving away free, round-trip plane tickets to the North Pole where they keep their bar complaint forms (which are NOT available online).

If for some reason you are unable to control yourself, never fear; Judge Houston Patton will operate his jail where no lawyers are needed or allowed as you just sit there for minutes... hours.... months...years until he decides he is tired of you sitting in his jail. Do not think Judge Patton is a bad judge however as he plans to serve free Mad Dog 20/20 to all inmates.</p>

<h2 id="catchreleasewatchtheshootoutonvideo">Catch &amp; Release, Watch the Shootout on Video</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-05-10</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/05/catch-release-capital-murder-suspect.html </p>

<p>Update: WLBT obtained and posted video of the shootout between a JPD officer and two suspects at a gas station on Cooper Road early Wednesday morning. The video is posted below. Remember, the suspects' family questioned the police and dropped some thinly-veiled hints that their family member was murdered.</p>

<p>Several observations after watching the video:</p>

<p>*The officer is damn lucky to be alive. He was assaulted by two large men, one of whom was 340 lbs. They got him down on the ground. They pulled out weapons and began shooting at him. He was very lucky.</p>

<p>*The officer had no partner or backup. He was strictly on his own. The manpower shortage at JPD is going to result in someone being killed. An officer could be killed because he is outnumbered or outgunned. An officer may be outnumbered as this one was and panic, thus killing a suspect because he fears for his life. Suppose he had started shooting in this confrontation after they grabbed him but before they pulled out weapons. One can only imagine the outcry against the police.</p>

<p>*Does the Lumumba administration advocate releasing the name of this officer?</p>

<p>*Chauncy Reed was arrested and charged by JPD. However, MBI will handle the case. JPD withdrew its charges and MBI faxed over its paperwork to HCSO. Sources told JJ that the faxed documents were ignored for awhile, thus resulting in Reed's mistaken release. The HCSO called it a "clerical error" in this press release:</p>

<p>Hinds County Sheriff’s Officials said today, a detention officer released Chauncy</p>

<p>Reed in error late Thursday.</p>

<p>Hinds County Investigators along with Jackson Police and U.S. Marshals were able to get Reed back </p>

<p>in custody hours later.</p>

<p>Detention Command Staff are currently reviewing the process and will have this corrected to prevent </p>

<p>a reoccurrence.</p>

<p>Reed is currently being held in the Madison County Jail with no bond.</p>

<p>Original post: The Catch &amp; Release program is doing quite well in Hinds County, thank you very much. The jailers at the Raymond Detention Center managed to turn loose a man arrested for murder earlier this week.</p>

<p>Chauncy Cornell Reed and his brother Elliot Reed got into a shootout with a JPD officer at a gas station on Cooper Road early Wednesday morning. Elliot was killed after opening fire on the officer. Earlier post with video. Chauncy was charged with capital murder and aggravated assault on a police officer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Chancy was released yesterday from the Raymond Detention Center despite the fact that he has not even had a bond hearing. U.S. Marshals tracked down Chauncy and captured him. He is in custody at the Madison County Detention Center.</p>

<p>Click on image to enlarge</p>

<p>Kingfish note: Expect Sheriff Mason to announce a high-profile drug or prostitution bust within the next week or so. At least Reed is now in a real jail. No Iphones or weed for this boy. Given his size, jail might be the best thing that happens for his health.</p>

<p>One suspect was critically injured and transported to a local hospital. The second was taken into custody at the scene. The officer did not suffer any serious injuries during the incident. </p>

<p>The current condition of the suspect is not yet unknown. The identities of both suspects have not been released. </p>

<p>This investigation is being conducted by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation who later arrived at the scene. </p>

<p>Store surveillance captured the incident as it unfolded and is still in the process of being reviewed. (2) Jackson Police have learned that the suspect injured this morning has died. He is identified as 30-year-old, Elliot Reed. </p>

<p>The second suspect involved is identified as 26-year-old, Chauncy Reed. Chauncy Reed was arrested and has been charged with Aggravated Assault on a Police Officer and Capital Murder. </p>

<p>This investigation is being conducted by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations. Any inquiries should be directed to the Mississippi Department of Public Safety Communications Chief, Warren Strain. </p>

<p>(3) Contact made by the officer with the individuals in the white SUV at the Valero was result of a traffic stop. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the family is questioning Reed's death.</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-22</p>

<p>url: https://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/04/dps-backstabbing-blue.html </p>

<p>The Mississippi Department of Public Safety failed yet again in its attempt to purge a sissified trooper from the ranks of the Mississippi Highway Patrol. The Mississippi Employee Appeals Board ordered DPS to reinstate with back pay Sergeant James Richards. DPS fired Sgt. Richards for the unlawful use of controlled substances even though he was recovering from hip replacement surgery and had prescriptions for the drugs he used.</p>

<p>Sergeant Richards has been a trooper since 2000. He suffered through a major hip replacement surgery in 2015 and was given several legal prescriptions. The medications were opioids, a benzo, and a schedule II. The Sergeant attended training and weapons qualification on October 31, 2016. He "successfully qualified" with three different firearms. However, DPS officials claimed he was acting sluggish and were "suspicious" he was "under the influence."</p>

<p>DPS made him submit to a drug test. Sergeant Richards tested positive for all of his prescribed medications. He did not test positive for any substance for which there was not a prescription.</p>

<p>However, DPS threw out his medical record and charged him with reporting to work when his ability was impaired by the "." The agency fired him on February 3, 2017 for</p>

<p>Reporting to work under the influence of, or when ability is impaired by, alcohol or the unlawful use of controlled substances. (Group Three Offense).</p>

<p>Sergeant Richards appealed to the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board. A tribunal held a hearing and ruled in his favor. The tribunal minced no words in blasting DPS for its unlawful treatment of James Richards as it said no less than four times that the Mississippi Department of Public Safety like to the Board and Sergeant Richards:</p>

<p>The basis for Richard's termination was untrue. All of the evidence resented at the hearing, including that offered by MDPS, illustrates that Richards had a valid prescription for all of the substances in his system. The issue succinctly stated is whether Richards' use of prescription medication may constitute an "unlawful use of controlled substances. Clearly it did not at this particular time. MDPS produced no evidence demonstrating that Richards had unlawfully used the controlled substances he was legally prescribed during his in-service training......</p>

<p>the basis for the termination is untrue and must be reversed by this tribunal. While Richards may have been impaired by his legal use of controlled substances, evidence presented at the hearing demonstrated that he successfully completed the training. Earlier post with copy of order. </p>

<p>However, the Fifth Floor Fops at DPS pursued their vendetta against Sergeant Richards and asked the Appeals Board to hear the case en banc. Police are at times accused of thinking they are above the law. Make no mistake, the Mississippi Department of Public Safety doesn't think it is above the law but thinks it can create the law out of thin air.</p>

<p>DPS asked the Board to ignore the part about "unlawful use of controlled substances":</p>

<p>However, the MOPS requests that this tribunal, and Hearing Officer Pierce, overlook the phrase "unlawful use" in the charges it brought against Mr. Richards. The MEAB, en bane, declines to do so....</p>

<p>The MDPS-now, but not at the time of Mr. Richards' pre-disciplinary stage or in Mr. Richards' tennination letter - contends that Mr. Richards used a lawful controlled substance, but used it in such a manner that resulted him being under the influence at the time he was participating in his in-service training. The MOPS' argument to the MEAB, en bane, is that any error in its termination letter to Mr. Richards was "technical," was "clearly harmless error" and that Mr. Richards has only suffered a procedural due process violation.</p>

<p>Thus, DPS makes a false accusation against Sergeant Richards but calls it "harmless error." Harmless unless you are the one getting fired because of the false accusation.</p>

<p>The Board politely but firmly faceplanted DPS's arguments into the cold pavement of reality and ordered DPS to reinstate Jim Richards with full back pay and benefits.</p>

<p>Kingfish note: Simply pathetic. The Appeals Board catches DPS repeatedly lying as it persecuted a veteran trooper who committed the cardinal sin of having hip replacement surgery. Colonel Hackworth had a perfect term for these officials: REMF's. Unfortunately for Sergeant Richards, DPS will probably torment this poor schmuck even more by appealing to Chancery Court and dragging him through the courts.</p>

<p>As stated in an earlier post, One shouldn't be too surprised that Marshall Fisher's DPS took this action. The termination took place at the very end of Santa Cruz's tenure as Commissioner. However, Marshall Fisher is perfectly capable of stopping this jihad against Sergeant Richards. Of course, Commissioner Fisher is the guy who wants to ban drug courts for drug dealers and jail doctors for at least 40 years if they write an opioid prescription that results in an overdose. Good luck to the poor trooper who must get an opioid prescription under the Commissioner's regime. The video posted below of the Commissioner's MBN Director makes it quite clear what these REMF's thinks of troopers who get hurt.</p>

<p>Don't expect any coverage by the media. This article shows the tough coverage provided by the state newspaper of DPS or whitewash jobs such as this one. </p>

<p>The capitol will have one less watchdog. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal laid off an editor and reporter yesterday but the reporter is the one who covered the state capitol, Bobby Harrison. Readers may cheer at the sight of a shrinking "liberal media" but the good ole boyz will have one less set of eyes watching their shenanigans in what is already the most corrupt state in America. Mr. Barksdale should consider replacing a couple of his reporters with Mr. Harrison. He would be able to double the workload at half the price. Hmm...... just had a thought. If NEMDJ is laying off staff, what about it's sister publication, the Mississippi Business Journal? Will it face any cutbacks?</p>

<h2 id="millsapschismsurveyvoterslikebryanthood">Millsaps-Chism survey: Voters like Bryant &amp; Hood</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-04-09</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/04/millsaps-chism-survey-voters-like.html </p>

<p>Millsaps College and Chism Strategies released a "State of the State survey that is posted below. </p>

<p>Voters Give Strong Reviews for Governor Bryant, Attorney General Hood</p>

<p>Mississippians support an increase in the cigarette tax, expansion of Medicaid, and stronger regulations for gun shows, according to the April 2018 Millsaps College-Chism Strategies State of the State Survey. Voters statewide are slightly more upbeat about the direction of the state than in previous months. With the conclusion of the 2018 legislative session, Mississippians have reservations about the performance of the State Legislature, but are more likely to approve of their own elected representatives than they are of the institution. They also strongly approve of the performance of Governor Phil Bryant and Attorney General Jim Hood.</p>

<p>According to the survey, 44% of respondents agree that the state is on the right track. This is an increase from just 37% in the September 2017 State of the State Survey and 42% in the January 2018 survey. Looking at the State Legislature, 30% of Mississippians approve of the institution’s performance while 41% disapprove. On the other hand, 40% approve of the work being done by their own elected legislators while 30% disapprove.</p>

<p>“We are hopeful that the Millsaps College-Chism Strategies State of the State Survey will continue to shed light on the way citizens perceive their institutions of government, some of the key actors in state politics, and important issues that have been debated in the most recent legislative session as well as past sessions,” said Dr. Nathan Shrader, assistant professor of political science and director of American Studies at Millsaps College. “Particularly, we find for the third consecutive quarter that Mississippians remain adamant about fixing roads and bridges, securing more funds for public schools, and improving access and affordability of health insurance in the state. These are important findings because we are now seeing clear patterns form within the electorate regarding their priorities and preferences.”</p>

<p>Other key survey findings from the Millsaps College-Chism Strategies State of the State Survey:</p>

<p>54% approve of the performance of Governor Phil Bryant, while 35% disapprove</p>

<p>Attorney General Jim Hood has an approval rating of 55%, while 25% disapprove</p>

<p>Lt. Governor Tate Reeves has an approval rating of 38% and a disapproval rating of 34%</p>

<p>51% approve and 45% disapprove of President Donald Trump’s job performance</p>

<p>Just 30% approve of the performance of the State Legislature, but 40% approve of their own elected legislators</p>

<p>A combined 63% say that their top policy priorities are either fixing roads and bridges, more money for public schools, or improved access and affordability of healthcare</p>

<p>Voters favor expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, 52% to 36%</p>

<p>64% of voters favor raising the state’s cigarette tax, a proposal defeated by the legislature</p>

<p>Mississippians are evenly split on arming schoolteachers, but strongly favor tighter regulations of gun shows</p>

<p>“Our partnership with Millsaps College on this survey research is important to me as an alumnus of the Millsaps Political Science Department,” said Brad Chism, President of Chism Strategies. “This survey series helps Millsaps enhance its role in the informed discussion about key issues in our state. This research will be a useful tool in any serious debate about public policy alternatives in our state.”</p>

<p>The State of the State Survey involves a partnership between the Millsaps College Political Science Department, the Institute for Civic and Professional Engagement at Millsaps, and Chism Strategies. The survey was completed March 27th. Sample size of 603 with 67% of interviews conducted via landline and 33% via cell phone. The survey has a Margin of Error of +/-4 %. Results were weighted to reflect 2015 general election turnout for age, race, gender, and partisanship.</p>

<p>Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Jeff Weill, a former state court prosecutor and Jackson city councilman, announced his candidacy today for the Mississippi Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>“I have been honored to serve the people of Mississippi for more than 11 years as a circuit court judge presiding over the most active civil and criminal docket in the state, and as a city councilman,” Judge Weill said. “As a judge my focus has always been on public safety. By vigorously moving the criminal trial dockets forward hundreds of violent criminals can no longer terrorize our streets and homes.”</p>

<p>The ten judges currently on the court of appeals are from diverse judicial backgrounds, but unlike Judge Weill, none have experience as circuit court judges. These appellate judges routinely rule on appeals from circuit courts, including the overwhelming majority of felony criminal appeals.</p>

<p>“I firmly believe that adding a circuit court judge who has presided in many complex jury trials will enhance the ability of the appellate court to properly decide appeals from trial courts,” said Judge Weill. Weill noted that “my time spent in the trenches will bring a much needed practical viewpoint to the process.”</p>

<p>Judge Weill has presided in more than 130 jury trials to verdict during his eight years on the bench, and over 100 of those were criminal trials involving major felonies. Judge Weill also brings a wealth of civil litigation experience to the appellate bench, as a trial judge, a former litigator and a Harvard trained mediator. He served as judge in the largest and most complex state court civil litigation to date and authored more than 60 opinions in that case alone.</p>

<p>As a former assistant district attorney for District Attorney Dunn Lampton in Pike, Lincoln, Walthall and Copiah Counties, Judge Weill prosecuted hundreds of criminal cases throughout southwestern Mississippi.</p>

<p>Judge Weill is active in Covenant Presbyterian Church where he serves as an elder, Sunday school teacher and active participant in foreign missions. Judge Weill is a stalwart in the local community, lending regular support and aid to the Stewpot ministries, Meals on Wheels, and as an adult leader in Boy Scout Troop 302. He and his wife Tracy have been married for 30 years and have three Eagle Scout sons, Alan (26), Joshua (23) and Elliot (20).</p>

<p>The election will be held November 6, 2018.</p>

<p>Current position: Judge Weill is in his 8th year as a twice-elected Hinds County circuit court judge, presiding over the most active civil and criminal docket in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Position sought: Judge Weill seeks election to the Mississippi Court of Appeals-4th district as the only judge on the Court of Appeals with crucial experience as a Circuit Court trial judge.</p>

<p>The Court of Appeals is a 10-judge panel of Judges which hears appeals from lower courts, including Chancery and Circuit Courts. The court is made up of two judges from each of the five judicial districts in the state. The 4th district includes 15 counties: Adams, Amite, Copiah, Covington, Franklin, Hinds, Jefferson Davis, Jones, Lawrence, Lincoln, Marion, Pike, Simpson, Walthall and Wilkerson.</p>

<p>Judge Weill:</p>

<p>• Currently serves as twice-elected Hinds County Circuit Court Judge</p>

<p>• Has Presided in over 130 jury trials, including 24 murder trials, and 59 assault/robbery trials</p>

<p>• Seeks to bring practical experience to the appellate bench as the only former circuit judge on the Mississippi Court of Appeals</p>

<p>• Formerly served as state court prosecutor in Lincoln, Pike, Copiah and Walthall Counties, serving with District Attorney Dunn Lampton</p>

<p>• Formerly served as twice-elected Republican City Councilman in Jackson</p>

<p>• Practiced law for 28 years prior to the bench and tried more than 70 jury trials</p>

<p>• Taught Alternative Dispute Resolution as an Adjunct Professor at Mississippi College School of Law</p>

<p>Trollfest '07 was such a success that Jackson Jambalaya will once again host Trollfest '09. Catch this great event which will leave NE Jackson &amp; Fondren in flames. Othor Cain and his band, The Black Power Structure headline the night while Sonjay Poontang returns for an encore performance. Former Frank Melton bodyguard Marcus Wright makes his premier appearance at Trollfest singing "I'm a Sweet Transvestite" from "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." Kamikaze will sing his new hit, “How I sold out to da Man.” Robbie Bell again performs: “Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be Bells” and “Any friend of Ed Peters is a friend of mine”. After the show, Ms. Bell will autograph copies of her mug shot photos. In a salute to “Dancing with the Stars”, Ms. Bell and Hinds County District Attorney Robert Smith will dance the Wango Tango.</p>

<p>Wrestling returns, except this time it will be a Battle Royal with Othor Cain, Ben Allen, Kim Wade, Haley Fisackerly, Alan Lange, and “Big Cat” Donna Ladd all in the ring at the same time. The Battle Royal will be in a steel cage, no time limit, no referee, and the losers must leave town. Marshand Crisler will be the honorary referee (as it gives him a title without actually having to do anything). </p>

<p>Meet KIM Waaaaaade at the Entergy Tent. For five pesos, Kim will sell you a chance to win a deed to a crack house on Ridgeway Street stuffed in the Howard Industries pinata. Don't worry if the pinata is beaten to shreds, as Mr. Wade has Jose, Emmanuel, and Carlos, all illegal immigrants, available as replacements for the it. Upon leaving the Entergy tent, fig leaves will be available in case Entergy literally takes everything you have as part of its Trollfest ticket price adjustment charge.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd of The Jackson Free Press will give several classes on learning how to write. Smearing, writing without factchecking, and reporting only one side of a story will be covered. A donation to pay their taxes will be accepted and she will be signing copies of their former federal tax liens. Ms. Ladd will give a dramatic reading of her two award-winning essays (They received The Jackson Free Press "Best Of" awards.) "Why everything is always about me" and "Why I cover murders better than anyone else in Jackson".</p>

<p>In the spirit of helping those who are less fortunate, Trollfest '09 adopts a cause for which a portion of the proceeds and donations will be donated: Keeping Frank Melton in his home. The “Keep Frank Melton From Being Homeless” booth will sell chances for five dollars to pin the tail on the jackass. John Reeves has graciously volunteered to be the jackass for this honorable excursion into saving Frank's ass. What's an ass between two friends after all? If Mr. Reeves is unable to um, perform, Speaker Billy McCoy has also volunteered as when the word “jackass” was mentioned he immediately ran as fast as he could to sign up. </p>

<p>In order to help clean up the legal profession, Adam Kilgore of the Mississippi Bar will be giving away free, round-trip plane tickets to the North Pole where they keep their bar complaint forms (which are NOT available online). If you don't want to go to the North Pole, you can enjoy Brant Brantley's (of the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance) free guided tours of the quicksand field over by High Street where all complaints against judges disappear. If for some reason you are unable to control yourself, never fear; Judge Houston Patton will operate his jail where no lawyers are needed or allowed as you just sit there for minutes... hours.... months...years until he decides he is tired of you sitting in his jail. Do not think Judge Patton is a bad judge however as he plans to serve free Mad Dog 20/20 to all inmates.</p>

<p>Trollfest '09 is a pet-friendly event as well. Feel free to bring your dog with you and do not worry if your pet gets hungry, as employees of the Jackson Zoo will be on hand to provide some of their animals as food when it gets to be feeding time for your little loved one.</p>

<p>Relax at the Fox News Tent. Since there are only three blonde reporters in Jackson (being blonde is a requirement for working at Fox News), Megan and Kathryn from WAPT and Wendy from WLBT will be on loan to Fox. To gain admittance to the VIP section, bring either your Republican Party ID card or a Rebel Flag. Bringing both and a torn-up Obama yard sign will entitle you to free drinks served by Megan, Wendy, and Kathryn. Get your tickets now. Since this is an event for trolls, no ID is required. Just bring the hate. Bring the family, Trollfest '09 is for EVERYONE!!!</p>

<p>This is definitely a Beaver production.</p>

<h2 id="mcppgetsnewpresidente">MCPP gets new Presidente</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-03-26</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/03/mcpp-gets-new-presidente.html </p>

<p>The Mississippi Center for Public Policy issued the following press release.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy (MCPP) has named Jon L. Pritchett as its new President and CEO. Pritchett is a native of North Carolina and comes to MCPP from the Tar Heel state’s John Locke Foundation, one of the nation’s oldest and most respected free-market, public policy think tanks, where he was Senior Vice President. Pritchett replaces MCPP's longtime president, Forest Thigpen.</p>

<p>Before working in public policy, Pritchett spent nearly three decades in the private sector in a variety of leadership positions. Among other executive roles, which included investment banking, public relations, and sports marketing, Pritchett was CEO of AstroTurf USA.</p>

<p>MCPP Board Chairman, Mike Dawkins said, “Jon Pritchett understands that the purpose of a free-market think tank is to guide policy, not based on political party affiliation, but based on principle. Jon will have a broad appeal to Mississippians across ideological lines. He communicates well with people with whom he may not agree because he respects their perspectives, while still holding to principles that will create a better place for all Mississippians. He challenges the mindset that a 'conservative' lacks compassion for the economically disadvantaged. Jon has succeeded as a business person and as an emerging leader in the free-market movement. Our board believes we have found an outstanding leader to guide MCPP.”</p>

<p>“Jon Pritchett is the consummate professional,” remarked John Locke Foundation Board Member, Theodore Hicks. “He loves liberty and is willing to fight for her, but always as a well-articulated, gentleman. Our loss is Mississippi’s gain. With Jon at the helm of MCPP, there’s no doubt that freedom in Mississippi will expand,” added Hicks.</p>

<p>When asked why she thought Pritchett was the right person to lead MCPP, MCPP Board Member, Gloria Walker responded, “We are beyond delighted that Jon and his family are moving to Jackson. We welcome the experience, passion, and energy that he brings to the position of President and CEO, because these skills are necessary for us to be successful in our mission to increase transparency at all levels of government. We look forward to working with Jon and are confident that he will bring a respect for traditional values that many Mississippians hold so dear. MCPP is very much alive and ready to start a new chapter.”</p>

<p>Pritchett will join the organization at the beginning of April. According to Pritchett, his immediate goals are focused on communications and fundraising. “The excellent work of MCPP and its talented staff is not as well-known across the state of Mississippi as it should be. Mississippians need to know about the vital work MCPP and the Mississippi Justice Institute do to fight the enemies of liberty, to enhance freedom, to limit government, to ensure choice and competition, and to promote the foundational principles of a thriving society, including individual responsibility and strong traditional families. And this work cannot be done in a robust and meaningful way without raising funds from individuals, foundations, and businesses,” said Pritchett. Unlike most 501(c)3 non-profit organizations, the Mississippi Center for Public Policy takes no money from government sources at the local, state or federal level. Pritchett continued, “I’m honored to have the opportunity to work with our staff and board to build onto the substantial foundation developed over 25 years by Forest Thigpen."</p>

<p>Jon is no stranger to Mississippi. When Jon was CEO of AstroTurf USA, Mississippi native Archie Manning served as AstroTurf''s spokesperson. Manning remarked, “I’ve known Jon since 2007, when I became involved with AstroTurf. He’s a strong leader, and I’m excited for Mississippi and for Jon.”</p>

<p>In addition to his role as a leader, manager, and fundraiser, Pritchett also writes op-eds on a variety of public policy issues, including corporate social activism, business regulations, culture wars, the business of sports, and leadership. His work has been published in the Wall Street Journal, Forbes, The Federalist, and Washington Examiner, among others. He has appeared on the Fox Business Network, the YES Network, and on the BBC. Pritchett also co-hosts a weekly podcast called Head Locke, which is a unique look at current news, culture, sports, business, and public policy.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jim Hood issued the following statement regarding his quiz of Facebook.</p>

<p>JACKSON—Attorney General Jim Hood sent a letter to Facebook, Inc. last week putting the social media giant on notice to preserve any relevant information for his investigation into the company’s user privacy practices in light of recent news about the company providing users’ personal information to third parties without users’ consent or knowledge. The investigation covers the time period starting in November 2013 and forward.</p>

<p>General Hood is investigating whether Facebook violated the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act when it gave permission to University of Cambridge Professor Aleksandr Kogan to harvest information of users who downloaded his app, thisisyourdigitallife. Types of information collected include user location, friends of the user, and user activity on the social media platform, which was then sold to a third party.</p>

<p>The letter sent to Facebook by General Hood served as a litigation hold notice, stating that parties have “a duty to preserve potentially relevant information that may be used as evidence in pending or reasonably foreseeable litigation.” It asked Facebook to preserve both paper and electronic documents that would provide information relating to this investigation, specifically “any and all documents and electronically stored information related to Dr. Aleksandr Kogan and his creation and use of an app called “thisisyourdigitallife” that used Facebook Login to pass data to a company called SCL/Cambridge Analytica.”</p>

<p>“Consumers are repeatedly being victimized by big business’ failure to properly safeguard their privacy rights,” said General Hood. “These companies are entrusted with our most personal information and need to be held accountable when they breach that trust. This is why we sued Google, which mined the data of students who used their educational software. We also took the issue to Congress, which just recently passed a bill that no longer gives immunity to websites that allow advertisers like backpage.com to advertise for child sex trafficking. Now we’re investigating Facebook, another everyday platform people use that is all the while collecting their personal information. Federal government is no longer big brother—these internet companies are big brother, and there have to be rules they must follow.”</p>

<p>Additionally, General Hood joined a bipartisan coalition with 36 state attorneys general in sending a separate letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, raising questions about the social networking site’s policies and practices, including:</p>

<p>· Were those terms of service clear and understandable?</p>

<p>· How did Facebook monitor what these developers did with all the data that they collected?</p>

<p>· What type of controls did Facebook have over the data given to developers?</p>

<p>· Did Facebook have protective safeguards in place, including audits, to ensure developers were not misusing the Facebook user’s data?</p>

<p>· How many users in the states of the signatory Attorneys General were impacted?</p>

<p>· When did Facebook learn of this breach of privacy protections?</p>

<p>· During this timeframe, what other third party “research” applications were also able to access the data of unsuspecting Facebook users?</p>

<p>As the attorneys general write in their letter to CEO Zuckerberg, news reports indicate the data of at least 50 million Facebook profiles may have been misused by third-party software developers. Facebook’s policies allowed developers to access the personal data of “friends” of people who used certain applications – without the knowledge or consent of these users.</p>

<p>General Hood reminds Mississippians to check the security settings on their social media accounts, paying close attention to any area that offers options for sharing data with applications connected to that social media platform. Users should also be vigilant of clicking on any links that they have not verified as a trusted source. For more consumer protection tips, visit agjimhood.com</p>

<p>Attorney General Jim Hood issued the following statement.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately for the taxpayers of Mississippi, the Senate leadership was bought and paid for this legislative session by giant corporations with little interest in the well-being of our citizens. As an example, campaign finance reports from 2010 through 2017 show that our lieutenant governor has raked in $193,750 in contributions from the companies that were awarded the contracts for the state’s Medicaid program. Of that amount, $50,000 was donated just last year to the lieutenant governor by Centene, the out-of-state parent company of Magnolia Health. The Senate successfully killed a proposal that would have allowed our own in-state hospitals to compete with the three managed care companies for the $3 billion Medicaid contracts.</p>

<p>In another example of huge corporations writing our laws, the Senate leadership allowed utility giant Entergy to slip an amendment into a bill that will make it more difficult for my office to take them to court for cheating the utility rate payers of Mississippi.</p>

<p>The Senate leadership failed once again to consider funding road and bridge repair partially with a fuel tax (7,000 – 8,000 jobs), an internet sales tax ($134 million), a lottery for education, the expansion of Medicaid ($11 billion and 11,000 jobs), or mental health to help with the opioid epidemic.</p>

<p>Instead of passing legislation to help our in-state businesses and our people, our Senate leadership is moving forward with massive tax cuts for predominantly out-of-state corporations (78% of $418 million tax cuts go to out-of-state corporations). All of this continues to lead our state down a path of financial ruin. Kansas, Louisiana, and West Virginia wrecked their economies and went into debt trying the same tax cuts. These huge out-of-state corporations fund their legislators with millions of dollars in campaign contributions.</p>

<p>Fortunately, lawmakers were able to keep the state from a financial deficit because of $32 million that the attorney general’s office brought them from various lawsuit settlements. Ironically these same lawmakers once again tried to pass bills limiting my office’s ability to go after their corporate masters. That’s no way to run a government.”</p>

<p>It's Canton Mayor Dr. William Truly. 'Nuff said. The Madison County Journal reports:</p>

<p>A colorful mural planned for downtown and designed to bring people together has instead split the town. </p>

<p>Joy Dodson, director of Keep Canton Beautiful, said it began a year ago when she was looking at painting a mural somewhere in town and decided on West Peace Street in a section known as The Hollow near where some of the movie “A Time to Kill” was filmed.</p>

<p>“I started doing research on murals in general,” she said. “Murals have improved economic development, they’ve improved foot traffic, they’ve improved community pride, and they’ve even decreased crime.”</p>

<p>Dodson said she wanted to do an interactive mural similar to ones found in larger cities such as Nashville and Atlanta, so travelers can tag themselves and promote the city on social media. </p>

<p>It was then she began speaking with merchants and vendors in the area and she said those in “The Hollow,” the hub of the African-American business/entertainment district in Canton’s early days, were trying to attract some of the foot traffic from the square. </p>

<p>Dodson then found a building owner excited about the project, and signed a contract for use of the side. She then worked with two local Canton artists on a design. The end result was an umbrella being showered by different colors, with words about the city on the side. Visitors would then be able to stand under the umbrella and snap a pic. </p>

<p>Dodson said she received unanimous approval from the Canton Historical Preservation District for the mural, and in December, presented the plans to aldermen. Mayor Dr. William Truly was not at the Dec. 17 meeting. </p>

<p>“At the very end of January we started painting,” she said. “On the second day of painting I received a call.” ...</p>

<p>Then she started dealing with the Mayor.</p>

<p>“At the very end of January we started painting,” she said. “On the second day of painting I received a call.” </p>

<p>She said Truly said there was a problem with the mural and they needed to talk about it before she continued. So they met, she said, and from there began a series of what she calls lies and misdirection. </p>

<p>Truly said he had no comment about the mural. </p>

<p>“I’m trying to put this city in the right direction,” he said. “Address the issue of housing, workforce development, and unemployment in our area. We may not catch Madison and Ridgeland but we’re certainly going to try.”</p>

<p>Dodson said three straight meetings she was removed from the city agenda. Text messages, emails and phone calls to Truly were not returned, she says. She even changed the messaging on the mural, but she says Truly wouldn’t even look at it.</p>

<p>In the end, she says Truly didn’t like the colors or the message, that he wanted something more like the mural on Hickory Street of Elmore James, and that she wasn’t going to get her mural. </p>

<p>“I’m just a fool for believing him all this time,” she said. “Why would you want forward progress — which is so necessary and needed — stopped in Canton.”</p>

<p>Canton Alderman Les Penn backs up Dodson’s account of the events that transpired over the mural, saying Truly said if the board voted to approve the mural he would just veto it.</p>

<p>“Not one alderman spoke up against it,” he said when it was initially presented. “(Truly) told me that a mural like that would look good somewhere in the Fondren area, but not in the Canton Hollow.” Rest of article. </p>

<p>Maybe the headline should have been "Why we can't have nice things in Canton." Some people are just plain pigs. They like living in slop and don't want to live any differently.... like the Canton Mayor.</p>

<p>ACLU Files Motion for Class Certification in Lawsuit Against Madison County Sheriff’s Department’s Disproportionate Targeting of Black Residents</p>

<p>March 14, 2018 – Jackson, MS - Black drivers and pedestrians who travel in majority Black neighborhoods in Madison County are disproportionately stopped at roadblocks and subjected to searches and seizures by the Madison County Sheriff’s Department, according to more than six-months of evidence collected thus far by the ACLU of Mississippi. The evidence, which was presented in court filings as part of a motion for class certification in Brown v. Madison County, shows what has been felt in communities of color for decades: that the Madison County Sheriff’s Department operates a policing program that targets Black people and Black communities on the basis of race.</p>

<p>Attorneys with the ACLU of MS, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the law firm of Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP presented data during a news conference that reflects how MCSD’s culture of discrimination directly impacts its policing of Madison County. The law enforcement agency has implemented and enforced an unwritten policy and longstanding practice of racially profiling Black individuals and disproportionately targeting Black communities through roadblocks, pedestrian stops, and other aggressive tactics.</p>

<p>The data shows that while Black residents make up only 38% of Madison County’s population, between 2012 and 2017:</p>

<p>“MCSD’s own paperwork confirms that it targets Black citizens for arrest,” said Joshua Tom, legal director for the ACLU of MS. “In the course of our class certification discovery, MCSD officials produced template forms that deputies use in the course of their duties, and on those forms from at least two officers appear pre-populated checkboxes marking ‘black,’ ‘male,’ and ‘arrested.’ The evidence will show discriminatory and unconstitutional policing, and we are looking forward to presenting all of the facts as our case moves forward.”</p>

<p>The eight named plaintiffs proposed as class representatives are Black people—men and women ages 28 to 63—who were unconstitutionally stopped, searched, or arrested by the MCSD, sometimes violently, while they were merely walking to work, driving in their neighborhood, celebrating with family, or just spending time in their own homes.</p>

<p>Lawrence Blackmon is one of those plaintiffs. A MCSD deputy tackled and handcuffed him at gunpoint after he asked to see a warrant before allowing officers to enter into his home. He remained handcuffed while the officers searched his home, possibly without a valid warrant, in violation of the law. This incident “would not have happened to me if I were a white person,” said Blackmon.</p>

<p>“The data regarding MCSD’s policing practices is significant. Ending discriminatory policing will improve the lives of thousands of citizens in Madison County,” said Jonathan Youngwood, co-chair of the Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP’s litigation department.</p>

<p>This lawsuit seeks reforms that safeguard constitutional rights by promoting bias-free and evidence-based policing, transparency, and police accountability. The lawsuit also seeks improved training, supervision, monitoring, and discipline of MCSD personnel, and the collection and public release of data on all roadblocks, stops, and searches conducted by MCSD to permit further analysis of policing practices for compliance with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.</p>

<p>Co-counsel Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP is handling the case pro bono. For more information, please visit: https://www.stblaw.com/.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. – Today, State Auditor Stacey Pickering notified local government officials in the Towns of Tchula and Raleigh, City of Shaw, and Coahoma County to prepare to pay delinquent court assessment fees to the Mississippi Treasurer’s Office or face receiving a formal demand from the Mississippi Office of the State Auditor (OSA).</p>

<p>Court assessment fees are commonly collected in association with traffic violations and misdemeanor offenses, and are required by state law to be deposited with the State Treasurer on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>The Town of Tchula has collected but not appropriately deposited $68,556.42 in assessments. The Town of Raleigh has collected but not appropriately deposited $47,076.72. The City of Shaw has collected but not appropriately deposited $14,935.35. Coahoma County has collected but not appropriately deposited $18,668.27.</p>

<p>OSA is aware of many other municipal and county governments failing to properly deposit assessment fees and has been reviewing this process for approximately one year. During these reviews, over $350,000 has been identified and deposited. OSA anticipates hundreds of thousands more dollars to be properly submitted before the completion of the audit review process.</p>

<p>Formal demands have not been issued yet. Each entity has thirty days to properly submit the assessment funds to the Treasurer’s Office. If those funds have not been submitted in that timeframe, a formal demand will be issued.</p>

<p>Trollfest '07 was such a success that Jackson Jambalaya will once again host Trollfest '09. Catch this great event which will leave NE Jackson &amp; Fondren in flames. Othor Cain and his band, The Black Power Structure headline the night while Sonjay Poontang returns for an encore performance. Former Frank Melton bodyguard Marcus Wright makes his premier appearance at Trollfest singing "I'm a Sweet Transvestite" from "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." Kamikaze will sing his new hit, “How I sold out to da Man.” Robbie Bell again performs: “Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be Bells” and “Any friend of Ed Peters is a friend of mine”. After the show, Ms. Bell will autograph copies of her mug shot photos. In a salute to “Dancing with the Stars”, Ms. Bell and Hinds County District Attorney Robert Smith will dance the Wango Tango.</p>

<p>Wrestling returns, except this time it will be a Battle Royal with Othor Cain, Ben Allen, Kim Wade, Haley Fisackerly, Alan Lange, and “Big Cat” Donna Ladd all in the ring at the same time. The Battle Royal will be in a steel cage, no time limit, no referee, and the losers must leave town. Marshand Crisler will be the honorary referee (as it gives him a title without actually having to do anything). </p>

<p>Meet KIM Waaaaaade at the Entergy Tent. For five pesos, Kim will sell you a chance to win a deed to a crack house on Ridgeway Street stuffed in the Howard Industries pinata. Don't worry if the pinata is beaten to shreds, as Mr. Wade has Jose, Emmanuel, and Carlos, all illegal immigrants, available as replacements for the it. Upon leaving the Entergy tent, fig leaves will be available in case Entergy literally takes everything you have as part of its Trollfest ticket price adjustment charge.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd of The Jackson Free Press will give several classes on learning how to write. Smearing, writing without factchecking, and reporting only one side of a story will be covered. A donation to pay their taxes will be accepted and she will be signing copies of their former federal tax liens. Ms. Ladd will give a dramatic reading of her two award-winning essays (They received The Jackson Free Press "Best Of" awards.) "Why everything is always about me" and "Why I cover murders better than anyone else in Jackson".</p>

<p>In the spirit of helping those who are less fortunate, Trollfest '09 adopts a cause for which a portion of the proceeds and donations will be donated: Keeping Frank Melton in his home. The “Keep Frank Melton From Being Homeless” booth will sell chances for five dollars to pin the tail on the jackass. John Reeves has graciously volunteered to be the jackass for this honorable excursion into saving Frank's ass. What's an ass between two friends after all? If Mr. Reeves is unable to um, perform, Speaker Billy McCoy has also volunteered as when the word “jackass” was mentioned he immediately ran as fast as he could to sign up. </p>

<p>In order to help clean up the legal profession, Adam Kilgore of the Mississippi Bar will be giving away free, round-trip plane tickets to the North Pole where they keep their bar complaint forms (which are NOT available online). If you don't want to go to the North Pole, you can enjoy Brant Brantley's (of the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance) free guided tours of the quicksand field over by High Street where all complaints against judges disappear. If for some reason you are unable to control yourself, never fear; Judge Houston Patton will operate his jail where no lawyers are needed or allowed as you just sit there for minutes... hours.... months...years until he decides he is tired of you sitting in his jail. Do not think Judge Patton is a bad judge however as he plans to serve free Mad Dog 20/20 to all inmates.</p>

<p>Trollfest '09 is a pet-friendly event as well. Feel free to bring your dog with you and do not worry if your pet gets hungry, as employees of the Jackson Zoo will be on hand to provide some of their animals as food when it gets to be feeding time for your little loved one.</p>

<p>Relax at the Fox News Tent. Since there are only three blonde reporters in Jackson (being blonde is a requirement for working at Fox News), Megan and Kathryn from WAPT and Wendy from WLBT will be on loan to Fox. To gain admittance to the VIP section, bring either your Republican Party ID card or a Rebel Flag. Bringing both and a torn-up Obama yard sign will entitle you to free drinks served by Megan, Wendy, and Kathryn. Get your tickets now. Since this is an event for trolls, no ID is required. Just bring the hate. Bring the family, Trollfest '09 is for EVERYONE!!!</p>

<h2 id="stateauditordemandscmucommissionersrepaynearlyd100000inpersonallegalfees">State Auditor demands CMU Commissioners repay nearly $100,000 in personal legal fees.</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>State Auditor Stacey Pickering issued the following statement.</p>

<p>Stacey Pickering Releases Issues Almost $100k of Demands to Canton Municipal Utilities Commissioners</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. – Today, OSA Special Agents presented civil demands to five current members of the Canton Municipal Utilities Board of Commissioners. Cleotha Williams, Charles Weems, L.C. Slaughter, Charles Morgan, and Cleveland Anderson were all served demands of $19,192.77, each. The total amount for the demands against the commissioners is $95,963.85, which includes principle, interest, and investigative costs.</p>

<p>The demands are related to Canton Municipal Utilities commissioners spending public funds to pay personal legal fees during a time they were not serving on the Canton Municipal Utilities Board of Commissioners.</p>

<p>The case will be delivered to the Attorney General of Mississippi for civil suit if the subjects of the demand do not respond within thirty days.</p>

<p>Kingfish note: JJ uncovered the payments and reported them on January 30:</p>

<p>Time stands still at Canton Municipal Utilities as the company paid old legal fees for CMU Commissioners even though the statute of limitations for paying invoices had expired.</p>

<p>This edition of As CMU Turns began in 2013 when Canton Alderman Les Penn moved at a Board of Aldermen meeting to remove CMU Commissioners Landers Cheeks, Cleotha Williams, Shoney Harris, and L.C. Slaughter. The fired Commissioners sued the city of Canton in Madison County Circuit Court and lost. Judge William Chapman ruled in 2015 that the removal was not arbitrary and capricious but was supported by evidence that the Aldermen had legitimate concerns about the operation of the public utility.</p>

<p>Cheeks and his merry band of rejects also sued for an injunction in Madison County Circuit Court in a separate lawsuit. The court denied the petition for an injunction. The losers didn't take no for an answer but appealed to the Court of Appeals, lost, and appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court where they lost again. It is now time to read a JJ-issued program so as to keep all the players straight.</p>

<p>Attorneys Ellis Turnage and Adrienne Wooten represented the deposed Commissioners in the first lawsuit. Ed Blackmon and Ellis Turnage represented the plaintiffs in the petition for the injunction. Adrienne Wooten represented Landres Cheeks as well. They lost every round in court.</p>

<p>However, the CMU board approved paying the legal fees of these commissioners even though CMU was not a party to the lawsuits and the commissioners were private citizens when the lawsuits were filed. The judge did not award attorney's fees to the plaintiffs since they lost. However, the CMU Board of Commissioners voted to pay the claims docket at the March 7, 2017 and March 21 meetings that included payments of $85,662 to attorneys Ellis Turnage, Adrienne Wooten, and Tamekia Goliday.* CMU issued the checks on the same day as the approval of the claims docket. Ms. Wooten and Ms. Goliday submitted invoices for work performed in 2013. Mr. Turnage billed for work from 2013 to 2015. It should be noted that Commissioners Slaughter and Williams voted on paying the claims docket even though it included payments to their personal attorneys who represented them in the Canton lawsuits. However, this is Canton where laws and ethics are suspended. </p>

<p>The invoices state that most of the billed work was performed in 2013. Ms. Wooten's invoice that her work was last performed on July 31, 2013 while Ms. Goliday's invoice states was last performed on July 12, 2013. Mr. Turnage billed for 231 hours but 97 hours were billed after March 7, 2014 so the payment for those hours fell within the three-year statute of limitations although 134 hours were billed after the statute of limitations expired.</p>

<p>*Here are the invoiced amounts:</p>

<p>Wooten: $11,550</p>

<p>Goliday: $4,120</p>

<p>Turnage: $69,992</p>

<p>Read more at this earlier post. The invoices are published in that post as well.</p>

<p>Quite a few employees at the Mississippi Department of Public Safety are taking advantage of a $1,000 annual clothing allowance even though they command rather nice salaries.</p>

<p>JJ obtained a roster of employees receiving the allowance through a public records request. Commissioner Marshall Fisher receives the allowance even though his annual salary is $138,115. Mississippi Highway Patrol Director Colonel Chris Gillard receives it as well even though his salary is $112,000 and he usually wears a MHP-provided uniform while on duty. 5 employees receive the allowance even though they earn over $100,000 per year. Posted below is a list of DPS employees who receive the allowance. The allowance was created for employees such as investigators who must wear professional attire in the performance of their duties. The allowance does not cover uniforms as they are provided by DPS nor the tailoring used for uniforms to pump up the biceps. However, the records show that it has become somewhat of a perk for the um, suits. A list of employees who aren't investigators or patrolmen is posted below as well.</p>

<h2 id="jacksonaccusedofdestroyingicedetainers">Jackson accused of destroying ICE detainers</h2>

<p>The public interest law firm Mississippi Institute for Justice issued the following statement. </p>

<p>Mississippi Justice Institute Files Complaint Challenging Jackson’s Sanctuary City Policy</p>

<p>Jackson ignores federal, state immigration law and violates public records laws,</p>

<p>(JACKSON) – The Mississippi Justice Institute (MJI) filed a complaint today at the Mississippi Ethics Commission stating that the City of Jackson is illegally destroying Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers.</p>

<p>"Jackson blatantly violates the law by throwing ICE detainers in the trash can," said MJI Director Shadrack White. "When MJI asked the City of Jackson what they did with ICE detainers, the City said they do not keep or maintain those records.”</p>

<p>ICE detainers are letters the federal government sends to local law enforcement when ICE believes local police have arrested someone who is in the country illegally. ICE detainers ask local police to hold those suspects until ICE can take custody of the illegal immigrant.</p>

<p>“Jackson has a responsibility to keep ICE detainers so they can be examined by the City’s taxpayers and citizens. Jackson residents deserve to know how many people who should have been deported are now walking the streets.”</p>

<p>In January, MJI filed a public records request with Jackson, asking for documents related to ICE detainers received by the Jackson Police Department. City officials acknowledged to MJI that “[t]here are not records kept or maintained by the department regarding detainer or immigration hold request” (sic).</p>

<p>That response led MJI to file the fifth major case in its history. MJI has also sued Jackson over its onerous regulations on new taxi businesses, has defended the rights of Mississippi charter school parents in a landmark constitutional case, and has fought to make local politicians obey open meetings laws in two other cases.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Jackson has been in hot water over its immigration policies. In November 2017 and January 2018, the Trump Administration’s Department of Justice sent letters to Jackson warning that the City had adopted dangerous “sanctuary policies” protecting illegal immigrants. Jackson was one of only 29 jurisdictions in the country to receive such a letter, joining places like San Francisco and Berkeley.</p>

<p>“Thanks to the Department of Justice, we found out that Jackson tells its police officers they cannot ask for information about the immigration status of someone they arrest. That’s a violation of federal immigration law and the state law banning sanctuary policies. Now we also know that when ICE asks Jackson PD to hold an illegal immigrant for deportation, Jackson simply throws ICE’s request in the garbage,” said White. “It’s a reckless policy.”</p>

<p>“Jackson needs to follow the law and keep its streets safe,” added White. “City leadership needs to show some compassion for good, honest folks who just want safe neighborhoods. Throwing away requests to hold illegal immigrants who have been arrested for a crime is no way to do that.”</p>

<p>“We’re prepared to take this matter all the way to the Mississippi Supreme Court if necessary,” said White. “We’re going to stand up for law-abiding Jackson residents and everyone who cares about government transparency. With this complaint, we hope the Ethics Commission will demand that Jackson stop destroying ICE detainers.”</p>

<p>“Someone has to demand that Jackson obey the law, and that’s exactly why the Mississippi Justice Institute exists,” said White.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Justice Institute is the legal arm of the Mississippi Center for Public Policy. It represents Mississippians whose state or federal Constitutional rights have been threatened by government actions.</p>

<p>Mississippi Justice Institute is supported by voluntary, tax-deductible contributions. It receives no funds from</p>

<p>government agencies for its operations. To learn more about MJI, visit www.msjustice.org.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure posted updated amendments to its prescription regulations and an economic impact statement on the Secretary of State's website. A hearing will be held on the economic impact statement on March 7 at 1:00 PM. The amendments to regulation 2640 and the economic impact statement are posted below. JJ hasn't been able to fully review the filings but here are some highlights:</p>

<p>*The economic impact is expected to be minimal overall but substantial to those actually affected by the amendments.</p>

<p>*Doctors can write prescription for acute, non-cancerous/terminal pain for ten days and write a refill for another ten days.</p>

<p>*"Point of service drug testing must be done at least three times per calendar year when Schedule II medication is written for the treatment of chronic non-cancer/non-terminal pain."</p>

<h2 id="agrecoversd32million">AG recovers $32 million</h2>

<p>date: 2018-02-20</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/02/ag-recovers-32-million-in-epps-scandal.html </p>

<p>Attorney General Jim Hood issued the following statement.</p>

<p>AG Sends $32 Million to the Legislature, Urges Mississippians to Tell Legislature: #LeaveOurAGAlone</p>

<p>Call your legislator—Capitol Switchboard: 601-359-3770</p>

<p>JACKSON—Attorney General Jim Hood announced the fourth settlement of the civil suits in the MDOC-Christopher Epps prison bribery scandal and deposited $32.1 million into the state’s general fund Tuesday, in the midst of the Legislature attempting to strip his Constitutional authority to go after corporate wrongdoers. General Hood is calling on Mississippians to contact their lawmakers and say, “Leave our AG alone!”</p>

<p>A portion of the check includes another settlement in the Epps case for $750,000 from CGL Facility Management, LLC, which is a company that provides facility management, project management, and corrective and preventative maintenance services to correctional facilities. The CGL settlement is the fourth of 11 civil actions to be settled in the Epps bribery scandal, and Tuesday’s deposit included $3.9 million from those cases.</p>

<p>The largest portion of the check delivered Tuesday is $25.3 million from a recently announced settlement with Watson Pharmaceutical, which sold overpriced drugs to the state’s Medicaid program, costing taxpayers $7 million.</p>

<p>The money sent to the general fund covers 21 cases (attached) settled by the attorney general with the majority of those cases involving violations under the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act (MCPA). That act is what protects Mississippians from being taken advantage of by corporations who have lied to customers, inflated their prices, and allowed safety measures to go unenforced, among other things. A number of bills currently pending in the state Legislature would remove the power of the attorney general to take these wrongdoers to court, thus resulting in not only losing billions of dollars to the state but, more importantly, fewer protections for Mississippians.</p>

<p>“This isn’t kids’ games, and should not be dismissed as just partisan politics,” said General Hood. “This is a billion dollars of the people’s money. The legislators driving these bills are attempting to give taxpayer money to corporations. We don’t want to believe it, but you can see corporations writing our laws. This should shock the conscience of republicans and democrats alike. With a billion dollars on the line, no reasonable prosecutor would dismiss the possibility of bribes, kickbacks, and campaign contributions being offered.”</p>

<p>House Bills 1238 and 1177 and Senate Bill 2295 each attack the attorney general’s authority by attempting to weaken or remove the office’s prosecutorial authority, in various ways, by uprooting his ability to fight for Mississippians under the MCPA and without getting prior approval from other agencies. The following is a short description of what each bill would do and non-exhaustive examples of how previously settled or pending litigation would be affected if these laws were in place:</p>

<p>· HB 1238</p>

<p>o Allows entities regulated by state and federal agencies to claim they do not have to abide by the MCPA due to outside regulations</p>

<p>§ Litigation affected: opioid manufacturers, which are being investigated for allegedly misrepresenting drug benefits; pharmaceutical companies who overprice drugs (Watson); Volkswagen, for selling vehicles that circumvent federal and state emission standards; Equifax, Experian, and Transunion, which was an investigation into credit reporting agencies regarding misrepresentation of credit monitoring services, credit reports, and credit scores that lead to a settlement</p>

<p>· SB 2295</p>

<p>o Requires approval by the Public Service Commission for the AG to bring suit against utility companies</p>

<p>§ Litigation affected: pending Entergy case, where the utility company faces a $1.1 billion lawsuit for overcharging its customers by not purchasing the cheapest power to sell to consumers</p>

<p>· HB 1177</p>

<p>o Allows state agencies and private citizens to file suit and collect damages owed to the state</p>

<p>§ Litigation affected: Watson Pharmaceutical; if bill becomes law, Division of Medicaid—not the AG—would investigate and file suit.</p>

<p>Many state agencies do not generally have resources needed to investigate and prosecute and could use different theories, that’s why the AG is tasked with representing the state</p>

<p>“If people are going to take action about something happening at the capitol, now is the time,” said General Hood. “These bills directly impact every Mississippian, and if they are signed into law, it would be devastating to everyone, including the people who are pushing this legislation. I was elected, just as other attorneys general before and after me, to protect you. I’m urging everyone to call their legislator to tell them to leave the AG’s office alone so that we can do our job protecting Mississippians as we have done long before I took office, and long after I leave.”</p>

<p>The number to the Capitol Switchboard is 601-359-3770, and constituents who wish to share the message on social media are asked to use #LeaveOurAGAlone</p>

<p>MDOC issued the following press release and photos. </p>

<p>Two officers arrested at SMCI in first shakedown of 2018 under Operation Zero Tolerance</p>

<p>JACKSON – Two officers at South Mississippi Correctional Institution in Greene County have been arrested after they were caught with contraband during the first major shakedown of the year under Operation Zero Tolerance.</p>

<p>Jadijah Rawls, 21, a correctional officer trainee hired in November, and Diane Phillips, 64, a correctional officer since February 2014, were booked into the Greene County Jail on Tuesday under state law 47-5-193, which prohibits contraband in a correctional facility.</p>

<p>Officers seized a cellphone concealed on Rawls and $750 cash and $1,420 in Green dot numbers from Phillips on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>“We are finding people who are trying to supplement their salaries by doing these types of illegal things,” Commissioner Pelicia E. Hall said during an appearance before the Senate Judiciary B Committee meeting Tuesday afternoon to update lawmakers about the department. She mentioned the shakedown while responding to questions.</p>

<p>“But we have a zero tolerance because of it,” Hall said. “The end result is I am continuing to lose staff, and that makes my understaffing problem that much greater.”</p>

<p>SMCI officers were surprised when the shakedown in Area II included searching them as well as the inmates at the south Mississippi prison in Leakesville. With contraband continuing to be found in facilities, other than being thrown over the perimeter fences, it is getting into the hands of inmates from staff and visitors, Hall said.</p>

<p>Therefore, staff as well as inmates will be searched in the second phase of Operation Zero Tolerance, she said.</p>

<p>“It’s important that we weed out those officers who don’t belong among our hardworking, honest employees,” Hall said. “We will make the adjustments to do the best we can to carry out our public safety mission.”</p>

<p>In addition to the money found on Phillips, $535 also was found hidden in a wall.</p>

<p>Other seized contraband items include 50 sharpened items, 27 Smart phones, 41 cellphone chargers, four flip phones, six cellphone batteries, three MP3 players, 20 sets of ear buds and Bluetooth devices, 14 packs of marijuana, 55 packages of spice, seven suspected packs of crystal methamphetamine, one suspected pack of cocaine, 11 packs of tobacco, numerous unidentified pills and assorted other items.</p>

<p>“One officer reportedly said during the shakedown at SMCI that she now feels safe for the first time in 16 years,” Hall said. “That is good to hear because these shakedowns are designed to do just that – to help staff and inmates be secure.”</p>

<p>Rawls and Phillips face termination. If convicted, each could serve from three to 15 years in prison, pay a $25,000 fine, or do both.</p>

<p>Trollfest '07 was such a success that Jackson Jambalaya will once again host Trollfest '09. Catch this great event which will leave NE Jackson &amp; Fondren in flames. Othor Cain and his band, The Black Power Structure headline the night while Sonjay Poontang returns for an encore performance. Former Frank Melton bodyguard Marcus Wright makes his premier appearance at Trollfest singing "I'm a Sweet Transvestite" from "The Rocky Horror Picture Show." Kamikaze will sing his new hit, “How I sold out to da Man.” Robbie Bell again performs: “Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be Bells” and “Any friend of Ed Peters is a friend of mine”. After the show, Ms. Bell will autograph copies of her mug shot photos. In a salute to “Dancing with the Stars”, Ms. Bell and Hinds County District Attorney Robert Smith will dance the Wango Tango.</p>

<p>Wrestling returns, except this time it will be a Battle Royal with Othor Cain, Ben Allen, Kim Wade, Haley Fisackerly, Alan Lange, and “Big Cat” Donna Ladd all in the ring at the same time. The Battle Royal will be in a steel cage, no time limit, no referee, and the losers must leave town. Marshand Crisler will be the honorary referee (as it gives him a title without actually having to do anything). </p>

<p>Meet KIM Waaaaaade at the Entergy Tent. For five pesos, Kim will sell you a chance to win a deed to a crack house on Ridgeway Street stuffed in the Howard Industries pinata. Don't worry if the pinata is beaten to shreds, as Mr. Wade has Jose, Emmanuel, and Carlos, all illegal immigrants, available as replacements for the it. Upon leaving the Entergy tent, fig leaves will be available in case Entergy literally takes everything you have as part of its Trollfest ticket price adjustment charge.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd of The Jackson Free Press will give several classes on learning how to write. Smearing, writing without factchecking, and reporting only one side of a story will be covered. A donation to pay their taxes will be accepted and she will be signing copies of their former federal tax liens. Ms. Ladd will give a dramatic reading of her two award-winning essays (They received The Jackson Free Press "Best Of" awards.) "Why everything is always about me" and "Why I cover murders better than anyone else in Jackson".</p>

<p>In the spirit of helping those who are less fortunate, Trollfest '09 adopts a cause for which a portion of the proceeds and donations will be donated: Keeping Frank Melton in his home. The “Keep Frank Melton From Being Homeless” booth will sell chances for five dollars to pin the tail on the jackass. John Reeves has graciously volunteered to be the jackass for this honorable excursion into saving Frank's ass. What's an ass between two friends after all? If Mr. Reeves is unable to um, perform, Speaker Billy McCoy has also volunteered as when the word “jackass” was mentioned he immediately ran as fast as he could to sign up. </p>

<p>In order to help clean up the legal profession, Adam Kilgore of the Mississippi Bar will be giving away free, round-trip plane tickets to the North Pole where they keep their bar complaint forms (which are NOT available online). If you don't want to go to the North Pole, you can enjoy Brant Brantley's (of the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance) free guided tours of the quicksand field over by High Street where all complaints against judges disappear. If for some reason you are unable to control yourself, never fear; Judge Houston Patton will operate his jail where no lawyers are needed or allowed as you just sit there for minutes... hours.... months...years until he decides he is tired of you sitting in his jail. Do not think Judge Patton is a bad judge however as he plans to serve free Mad Dog 20/20 to all inmates.</p>

<p>Trollfest '09 is a pet-friendly event as well. Feel free to bring your dog with you and do not worry if your pet gets hungry, as employees of the Jackson Zoo will be on hand to provide some of their animals as food when it gets to be feeding time for your little loved one.</p>

<p>Relax at the Fox News Tent. Since there are only three blonde reporters in Jackson (being blonde is a requirement for working at Fox News), Megan and Kathryn from WAPT and Wendy from WLBT will be on loan to Fox. To gain admittance to the VIP section, bring either your Republican Party ID card or a Rebel Flag. Bringing both and a torn-up Obama yard sign will entitle you to free drinks served by Megan, Wendy, and Kathryn. Get your tickets now. Since this is an event for trolls, no ID is required. Just bring the hate. Bring the family, Trollfest '09 is for EVERYONE!!!</p>

<h2 id="daappealssuspectsreleasetosupremesinfortificationstreetmurdercase">D.A. appeals suspect's release to Supremes in Fortification Street murder case</h2>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/02/da-appeals-suspects-release-to-supremes.html </p>

<p>Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith asked the Mississippi Supreme Court yesterday to order Hinds County Senior Circuit Judge Tomie Green to hold a hearing on the release of Nicholas Coats. Nicholas Coats was arrested and charged with the murder of Chelsie Kirschten on Fortification Street in October. County Court Judge William Skinner denied bond for Coats but ordered him to be released if he was not indicted within 90 days. Coats was released from the Raymond Detention Center on January 10.</p>

<p>The D.A. submitted a petition for a writ of mandamus yesterday. The petition states that Coats was released without any notice to the D.A. or Judge Skinner in violation of the rules of criminal procedure. Rule 8.5(c) is cited and requires the Senior Circuit Judge to review the "conditions of release for every felony defendant who is eligible for bail and has been in jail for more than 90 days." The petition also states that a prosecutor is supposed to be present when the review occurs so any necessary objections can be made.</p>

<p>Coats and Lidarius Dixon were charged with murder in the death of Chelsie Kirschten. The 23 year-old waitress was killed on August 17 when she was stopped at the intersection of Fortification Street and North State Street. Jushun "Red" Paige was charged with accessory after the fact - murder. None of the defendants have been indicted. Paige and Dixon are being held without bond although Paige asked to be released as well. Coats was released from prison one month prior to the murder after serving a short sentence for carjacking.</p>

<p>The petition accuses Judge Green of violating her own order. Indeed, Judge Green's 2013 order for bond review of unindicted detainees states:</p>

<p>IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that when an accused is arrested on a felony charge, and is held without bond or fails and is ,unable to make bail his/her case shall be presented for indictment before a Hinds County grand jury within ninety (90) days of his date of incarceration. Should the prosecutor fail to present said accused's case to the grand jury for indictment within the ninety (90) day time frame, then the Prosecutor shall appear at a bond review hearing before the senior circuit judge to show good cause why the accused should remain incarcerated., without indictment having been issued. Any indigent accused shall be represented by the Public Defender of Hinds County. (P.20 in file posted below)</p>

<p>The D.A. states that Judge Green has refused to rule on his motions to revoke bond for Nicholas Coats. She told Mr. McNamara in a February 7 email after he requested a hearing:</p>

<p>The court cannot address this matter as filed or under Rule 8.Sc. You may consider recalling the grand jury ASAP and presenting the case for indictment. Once the case is indicted, a circuit judge will be assigned. You can then request that the circuit judge review or reconsider Coats release. (P.18)</p>

<p>The grand jury is not scheduled to meet again until April 10.*</p>

<p>*Think about that one. The grand jury in Hinds County only meets every three months or so. The schedule is set by the Senior Circuit Judge.</p>

<p>Kingfish note: This site is no fan of the D.A. but nice job on fighting for this case and taking it to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Hinds County Chancellor Dewayne Thomas upheld the constitutionality of charter schools today and dealt a blow to the Southern Poverty Law Center's attempt to outlaw charter schools.</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center asked Hinds County Chancellor Thomas to declare Mississippi charter schools unconstitutional and illegal. The nominal plaintiffs are John Sewell, Kimberly Sewell, Evelyn Araujo, Charles Araujo, Cassandra Overton-Welchlin, Lutaya Stewart, and Arthur Brown. The suit named Governor Phil Bryant, the Mississippi Department of Education, and the Jackson Public School District as defendants. Earlier post about complaint. </p>

<p>The key point of the opinion is:</p>

<p>Plaintiffs submit that public charter schools are not "free school" and so the funding mechanism of Section 37-28-55(1)(a) is unconstitutional. ..... Mississippi public education is a free education; likewise, Mississippi public charter schools are free schools. The MCSA specifically provides that public charter schools may not charge tuition. See Mississippi Code Annotated §37-28-43(4). The plain language of Section 208 provides that schools must be conducted as a free school to receive appropriations. A free school is a school which does not charge tuition. </p>

<p>The complaint claimed the Charter School Act (CSA) "diverts public money to charter schools" from ad valorem taxes and "per-pupil funds from the Mississippi Department of Education". It is argued that the ad valorem tax revenue belongs to the local school district and can not be given to a school outside of the district's "control".</p>

<p>SPLC also posits that the Mississippi Constitution bars the legislature from giving money to any school that is not a "free school". However, SPLC argues that a free school isn't just one that charges no tuition. A "free school" must be also be under the control of both the state and local Superintendents of Education.</p>

<h2 id="dpscaughtlyingwhenitfiredtrooper">DPS caught lying when it fired trooper.</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-02-12</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/02/dps-caught-lying-when-it-fired-trooper.html </p>

<p>The Mississippi Department of Public Safety's attempt to purge a sissy from its ranks failed last week when the Mississippi Employee Appeals Board ordered DPS to reinstate a fired trooper with back-pay and benefits. The Board ruled that DPS illegally fired Sergeant James Richards for taking prescription medications after he had major hip replacement surgery.</p>

<p>Sergeant Richards has been a MHP Trooper since 2000. He suffered through a major hip replacement surgery in 2015 and was given several medications. The medications were opioids, a benzo, and a schedule II. These were legal prescriptions. The Sergeant attended training and weapons qualification on October 31, 2016. He "successfully qualified" with his three firearms. However, officials thought he was acting sluggish and were "suspicious" he was intoxicated and had him drug tested.</p>

<p>Sergeant Richards tested positive for all of his prescription medications. The prescriptions were valid when he was tested and he did not test positive for any substance for which there was not a prescription.</p>

<p>However, DPS threw out his medical record and charged him with reporting to work when his ability was impaired by the "unlawful use of controlled substances." DPS ruled:</p>

<p>Based on the above, it is evidence that the actions alleged herein are in violation of departmental rules and regulations, being DPS General Order 9.03.04, B., 3., c. Therefore, it is my belief that Sergeant James Richards, a sworn officer of the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol should be subjected to a Performance Review Board Hearing pursuant to the provisions of DPS General Order 9.04, with the allegations contained herein heard as one Group Three Offense.</p>

<p>DPS fired him on February 3, 2017 for</p>

<p>Reporting to work under the influence of, or when ability is impaired by, alcohol or the unlawful use of controlled substances. (Group Three Offense).</p>

<p>Sergeant Richards appealed to the Board. The Board said DPS lied but in more professional terms (Is anyone surprised that this agency is once again caught not telling the truth?). The order says it all:</p>

<p>The basis for Richard's termination was untrue. All of the evidence resented at the hearing, including that offered by MDPS, illustrates that Richards had a valid prescription for all of the substances in his system. The issue succinctly stated is whether Richards' use of prescription medication may constitute an "unlawful use of controlled substances. Clearly it did not at this particular time. MDPS produced no evidence demonstrating that Richards had unlawfully used the controlled substances he was legally prescribed during his in-service training. The medication in his system was legally prescribed to him by a licensed physician and according to Richards, taken as directed. There was no evidence that Richards took more than the prescribed dose during the relevant period of time. And while there is no disputing the fact that Richards had controlled substances in hi system, there is absolute zero evidence that Richards unlawfully used the controlled substances which was the basis of his termination. </p>

<p>The opinion delivered a knockout blow to DPS:</p>

<p>the basis for the termination is untrue and must be reversed by this tribunal. While Richards may have been impaired by his legal use of controlled substances, evidence presented at the hearing demonstrated that he successfully completed the training. </p>

<p>DPS also received a little lecture about life in general from the Board:</p>

<p>Those serving in a law enforcement capacity are people too. They get injured. They get sick. From time to time, it is expected that they too will visit the doctor and occasionally be prescribed medication. That medication may sometimes be a controlled substance to help him or her recover from a painful condition. There is nothing illegal or problematic about that. From the evidence, this tribunal cannot conclude that Richards illegally used any controlled substance as MDPS has contended. Therefor, this basis for Richard's termination must fail as an untruth. </p>

<p>The Board ordered MDPS to reinstate Sergeant Richards with full back-pay, medical leave, and benefits "as if he had never been terminated."</p>

<p>A sissy thus returns to the ranks.</p>

<p>Kingfish note: How many times did the order state DPS was lying? Three? Four? What bonehead lawyer at DPS thought firing this guy was a good idea? Of course, pointing out that DPS caught caught lying and screwing over a guy who puts his life on the line every day is "targeting" DPS.</p>

<p>One shouldn't be too surprised that Marshall Fisher's DPS took this action. He is the guy who wants to ban drug courts for drug dealers and jail doctors for at least 40 years if they write an opioid prescription that results in an overdose. If you want a look at health care policy run by DPS, just read the order posted below.</p>

<p>So much for what Governor Bryant said about the buck stopping. </p>

<p>Oh, why is the term sissy used in this post?</p>

<p>AN ACT TO CLARIFY THAT A SINGLE INSTANCE OF A MOTORIST'S TIRE TOUCHING A LINE OR REFLECTOR OR A SINGLE INSTANCE OF WEAVING SLIGHTLY WITHIN THE LINES MAY NOT CONSTITUTE REASONABLE GROUNDS OR PROBABLE CAUSE FOR A TRAFFIC STOP; TO CLARIFY THAT ANY SMELL OR ODOR SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE REASONABLE GROUNDS OR PROBABLE CAUSE FOR THE SEARCH OF A VEHICLE DURING A TRAFFIC STOP; AND FOR RELATED PURPOSES.</p>

<p>SECTION 1. (1) In traffic stops conducted by a law enforcement officer of this state or a political subdivision thereof, a single instance of a motorist's tire touching a line or reflector or a single instance of weaving slightly within the lines shall not constitute reasonable grounds or probable cause for a traffic stop.</p>

<p>(2) In traffic stops conducted by a law enforcement officer of this state or a political subdivision thereof, any smell or odor shall not constitute reasonable grounds or probable cause for a search of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Kingfish note: It sufficeth to say that law enforcement is in a tizzy over this bill. Does this mean that a police officer can't use the fact that a driver reeks of alcohol as probably cause? The bill was referred to House Judiciary Committee "B". The Chairman is Representative Andy Gipson.</p>

<h2 id="formerdpsemployeesuesoverallegedretaliationforreportingbogustickets">Former DPS employee sues over alleged retaliation for reporting bogus tickets</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-01-30</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/01/former-dps-employee-sues-over-alleged.html </p>

<p>Two former Mississippi Department of Public Safety employees accused the Department of firing them in retaliation for reporting the a bogus ticket-writing scheme by troopers to the federal government. The accusations were made in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court on October 16, 2017.</p>

<p>Penny Corn was the office director for the Division of Highway Safety. Fellow plaintiff Twyla Jennings was her assistant. The Division was responsible for obtaining and monitoring grants. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration awarded two grants to DPS for enforcement of DUI and impaired driving laws. The grants covered overtime pay for troopers who caught impaired drivers.</p>

<p>Ms. Corn claims that she discovered troopers were submitting false tickets so they could get paid:</p>

<p>Plaintiffs Penny Nichols Com and Twyla Jennings learned from a patrolman that the Office of the Mississippi Highway Patrol was conducting an Internal Affairs investigation into state troopers writing "ghost tickets" and using those "ghost tickets" to receive overtime pay from said federal grants. "Ghost tickets" are tickets written fraudulently and "issued" to "drivers" who are dead or who do not exist, with the tickets later turned in by the patrolmen and utilized as the basis of paying the patrolmen overtime. Being fraudulent, the tickets were never forwarded to the appropriate courts for charging the individuals named in the ticket with impaired driving. The tickets could not be processed through court because the persons named in those tickets were fiction and never were stopped and/or arrested by the state trooper involved.</p>

<p>She did what any bureaucrat who takes her job seriously but doesn't want to keep it does: she told her superiors:</p>

<p>On October 3, 2016, Plaintiff Penny Nichols Com reported to Colonel Kevin Myers and Deputy Administrator Ken Magee that Internal Affairs was performing an investigation into the "ghost tickets." Kevin Meyers and Ken Magee said they knew of no such Internal Affairs investigation but that they would find out if one existed and let Penny know if such an investigation had been or was being conducted.</p>

<p>She didn't stop with notifying her superiors but also informed the NHTSA about the investigation:</p>

<p>On October 5, 2016, Plaintiff Penny Nichols Com reported by email and telephone conversation to Brian Jones ofNHTSA that Internal Affairs was investigating "ghost tickets." As a direct and proximate result of the report, NHTSA froze all grant funds under said grants and indicated it would not pay overtime until it was satisfied with the results of the Internal Affairs investigation. The Governor was notified ofNHTSA's decision.</p>

<p>On October 6, 2016, Plaintiff Penny Nichols Com followed up her telephone conversation to Brian Jones of NHTSA with an email also telling NHTSA about the Internal Affairs investigation into "ghost tickets." The email Plaintiff Com sent to Brian Jones was copied to Albert Santa Cruz, the Commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, Chris Gillard, a Colonel with the Mississippi Highway Patrol, Randy Ginn, a Lieutenant Colonel, an</p>

<p>The plaintiff claims she was fired on October 17, 2016 and given no explanation for the termination. Ms. Jennings was fired on November 28, 2016 and given no reason for the termination as well. They accuse DPS of firing them because they reported the alleged ghost tickets to the NHTSA.</p>

<p>They accused the department of violating their free speech rights as well as violating their rights as whistleblowers. Attorneys Dennis Horhn and Stephen Brandon represent the plaintiffs.; The case is assigned to Halil S. Ozerden and Magistrate Linda Anderson. The plaintiffs seek lost wages and an unspecified amount of damages.</p>

<p>Ms. Corn sued DPS in 2015 for sex discrimination and retaliation. DPS settled the case in 2016 for $84,474.</p>

<p>Kingfish note: Read the earlier posts about her 2015 lawsuit. Some of the details are rather entertaining to read. This is the first time any mention of the bogus ticket scheme has been made in any type of public document. DPS to this day has not admitted there was even an investigation into the matter. JJ reported in 2016:</p>

<p>Some Mississippi Highway Patrol troopers apparently adopted the best business practices of Wells Fargo. Five troopers were busted for allegedly writing ghost DUI tickets so they could get paid under a federal DUI enforcement program.</p>

<p>NHTSA offers grants to law enforcement agencies for DUI enforcement. The grant pays troopers to work DUI enforcement on their off days. Such an arrangement has several benefits. The troopers have an opportunity to earn more money. The Mississippi Highway Patrol gets to put more troopers in the field to arrest drunk drivers at no extra cost.</p>

<p>The troopers in question were allegedly writing fake tickets to turn in with their grant paperwork but were not submitting the tickets to Justice Court or taking anyone to jail. The feds found discrepancies and investigated. DPS conducted its own investigation and charged the five troopers. It should be noted that these troopers were a pack made up of former MHP Colonel Don Berry's pets.</p>

<p>MHP sources say a disciplinary hearing has been scheduled in several weeks. However, the hearing will be conducted by an administrative law judge instead of the usual board comprised of troopers. A Mississippi Department of Public Safety representative declined to comment. The representative said the department would not confirm nor deny the existence of any such investigation. Earlier post. </p>

<p>The troopers were acquitted in a hearing adjudicated by attorney Fred Banks. DPS did not follow the normal procedure have having a panel of five fellow troopers determine whether disciplinary action was warranted against the troopers.</p>

<p>This story will not be covered anywhere else in the media. The Badge Bunnies can't be bothered. Don't want to jeopardize that access.</p>

<h2 id="dpswhinesaboutjjtargeting">DPS whines about JJ "targeting"</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-01-24</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/01/dps-whines-about-jj-targeting.html </p>

<p>The Mississippi Department of Public Safety complained that this website was "targeting" the agency with it's coverage. DPS made the accusation in a response to a public records complaint this correspondent submitted to the Ethics Commission last year. JJ attempted to obtain copies of correspondence and payment demands from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from DPS. DPS said the records were part of an "investigation" and exempted from the Public Records Act. The Ethics Commission ruled against the agency in December. DPS provided the records. Earlier post about Ethics Commission opinion. </p>

<p>JJ asked for "All correspondence in 2016 with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or its representatives regarding the NHTSA DUI enforcement grants" in a public records request submitted to DPS on October 14, 2016. DPS refused to provide any records in an October 18 response:</p>

<p>For the past two months, the Mississippi Highway Patrol has been conducting an internal investigation into paperwork filed in a federally-funded initiative targeting impaired motorists. This is an on-going investigation. As such, pursuant to exemptions in the Mississippi Public Records Act, we cannot release information regarding this investigation at this time. Therefore, your request is denied at this time.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that JJ was asking for correspondence between the state and federal government and not any internal documents pertaining to an investigation. JJ protested and said such correspondence is not part of any investigation. DPS replied "The documents you are requesting are part of the investigation and are exempt from the Open Records Act." Earlier post with copy of federal demands. </p>

<p>DPS in its arrogance didn't consider there was another government agency at the end of this pipeline. JJ submitted the same request to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. NHTSA provided records that showed it was demanding repayment of $7.1 million and was referring the demand to the Treasury Department for collection. This dispute was never reported in the media.</p>

<p>JJ submitted a complaint to the Ethics Commission. DPS attorney Trae Sims responded on August 24, 2017 in a letter sent to the Ethics Commission. The entire letter is posted below with some commentary by yours truly. The letter begins:</p>

<ol>
<li>Complainant xxxx submitted his purported Public Records Request to MOPS Communications Director via email on October 14, 2016 (see complaint). It is important to note that MOPS has for some time had on file with the Mississippi Secretary of State its Public Records Policy as part of the Administrative Code, which is publicly accessible online and otherwise. MDPS's policy therein states clearly that among the information a requestor should include is the address of the requestor and the signature of the requestor. Neither of those pieces of information were included in complainant's 10-14-16 request. Therefore, because complainant failed to submit a request in the proper form, the instant complaint is premature. It is understood that the request was denied for different reasons; however, the fact of agency policy based on applicable statute (Miss. Code§ 25-61-5) remains nonetheless.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is just one problem with this claim: DPS is not telling the whole truth. JJ has submitted at least 20, yes 20, public records requests to the Mississippi Department of Public Safety via email. Every one of them has been accepted, reviewed, and answered by DPS attorneys. DPS never said that the requests were improperly submitted nor made this correspondent aware that this procedure was in place.</p>

<p>DPS also replied to this emailed public records request via email as well. DPS had no problem accepting and responding to JJ's emailed public records requests until it suddenly had to defend itself before the Ethics Commission. The agency then tried to play a game of "gotcha" that fortunately failed. The learned attorney apparently has never heard of the term "waive."</p>

<p>However Mr. Sims, don't worry, the Kingfish will follow your procedure to the letter. Instead of trying to force you to enter the 21st century, the Kingfish will simply bring his public records request to the Department of Public Safety and submit them personally to you every time. Maybe you will get tired of seeing me in your face and modify your archaic procedures to more sensible ones. Check out the Department of Education. It could teach you a lesson or two in how to submit public records requests.</p>

<ol>
<li>It is clear from the complaint and attached documents that complainant has met with success in obtaining the records he apparently sought as they were available from other sources. Therefore, complainant has not been prohibited from accessing the documents he now complains of not receiving from MDPS. Further, as stated in Warren Strain's email response to complainant's records request, MDPS understood that an investigation was being conducted surrounding the subject area of the request. As such, and without the permission of the investigating agency, MDPS did not believe it was clear to release such records that may impact another agency's investigation with the agency's express authorization. MDPS has no authority or control over another agency that may choose to release records. </li>
</ol>

<p>Thus DPS's position is that it can break the laws as long as another agency complies with them. Keep in mind that JJ did not ask for the investigative reports but the demands for payment from the federal government. DPS, in it's arrogance, never once stated how the investigative exemption to public records applied to this request. It just claimed it was under investigation and said "trust us." Accountability is a concept lost on the Mississippi Department of Public Safety. Now for the best part of the response.</p>

<ol>
<li>While complainant argues that MDPS "lied" in its response (as seems to fit his ongoing narrative campaign targeting MDPS), he, at the same time, requests that the Commission promulgate rules to clarify the definition of an investigative document. Therefore, it would seem that complainant also admits that an investigative document is open to more than one interpretation, thus supporting MDPS's position relative to its initial response.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the above and foregoing reasons, MDPS would request dismissal of the instant complaint as both premature, or in the alternative as it seeks information related to ongoing investigations. Should the dismissal request not be well taken, MDPS would request a hearing on the subject complaint.</p>

<p>Targeting? This statement is simply more proof that the Mississippi Department of Public Safety thinks it is accountable to no one. It wasn't JJ that abused the clothing allowance. It wasn't JJ that is forced to repay $7.1 million because it can't manage a grant. It wasn't JJ that settled a reverse discrimination lawsuit or had to settle multiple employment discrimination lawsuits for $388,906. It wan't JJ that had several troopers accused of writing bogus tickets to get paid under federal grant and changed the procedures for their disciplinary hearing. It wasn't JJ that screwed up the payment of the advertising contract or gave a million-dollar emergency no-bid contract because it botched the RFP. It wasn't JJ that got caught by the feds for misspending the DUI grants. It wasn't JJ that got caught having sex with a trucker on the job and escaped discipline. </p>

<p>It is quite clear there was nothing investigative about the records requested by JJ and DPS lied through its teeth. DPS hid the fact that the federal government was trying to force Santa Cruz and his cult of cronies to repay $7.1 million for treating DUI enforcement grants as a slush fund. Serve &amp; Protect at the Mississippi Department of Public Safety means DPS leaders serve themselves &amp; protect their asses. There is incompetence and cronyism run amuck at that agency, and this entire fiasco is glaring evidence of it. They are bureaucrats who hide in ratholes behind badges of blue while the politicians look the other way.</p>

<p>While all of this has been going on between the feds and DPS, read the DPS coverage over at the "state newspaper." Unfortunately, readers will need read most of these stories in the rest of the media. There is too much laziness, incompetence, and a fear of losing police access in the media today.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Department of Public Safety's response to JJ's complaint shows everything that is wrong with the agency. Unfortunately, our leaders worship the blue as Mississippi slides further and further into an abyss of corruption.</p>

<p>Perhaps if the media would actually do its job, DPS wouldn't feel that it was targeted by Jackson Jambalaya.</p>

<p>Correction time: JJ goofed. The opioid amendments were not, repeat, NOT withdrawn. The SOS told JJ that the withdrawal notice posted below applies to proposed rules that were filed earlier. The second notice posted below refers to the opioid amendments approved by the Board of Medical Licensure on December 15, 2017. The withdrawal apparently referred to reg 2640 amendments filed on 9/22/2017. The second notice posted below refers to the amendments approved in December. JJ apologizes for the error. Feel free to throw stones in the comments.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure withdrew its proposed "Opioid Amendments."</p>

<p>However, there is one feature of this withdrawal that is rather curious. The date states it was filed on December 29, 2017. However, when yours truly checked the website on New Year's Day, this is what appeared - the proposed regs along with an effective date. They no longer appear on the SOS website.</p>

<p>State Representative Andy Gipson issued the following statement on the 3rd District Congressional race.</p>

<p>Statement of Representative Andy Gipson Announcing Decision on Candidacy</p>

<p>After much prayer and consideration with my family and close friends, I am announcing today that I will not be a candidate for the Republican nomination for Mississippi’s Third Congressional District Representative. Although I certainly appreciate the many words of encouragement and offers of support throughout the district and the State, I am making this decision because this is just not the right time for my family, and especially for our young children.</p>

<p>A commitment to run and potentially serve in Washington D.C. is a major long-term commitment for any person, and one that should be carefully weighed with the family in mind. God has blessed me with an amazing wife, Leslie, and our four children under the age of 13. Right now they are our primary responsibility to nurture and raise right here in our beautiful State.</p>

<p>It is our sense that at this particular point in time I should continue to serve the people of Mississippi in my current capacity as State Representative for Rankin and Simpson Counties, and as a Committee Chairman in the Mississippi House of Representatives. At the same time, my family and I are not ready to close any doors for future opportunities to serve the people of Mississippi. We love our State and its people, and our desire is to serve in the most effective capacity to help make Mississippi the very best it can be.</p>

<p>I look forward to learning more about the Republican candidates who are offering themselves for public service in Congress, and I wish them all well.</p>

<h2 id="kingfishwinsoneagainstdpsatethicscommission">Kingfish wins one against DPS at Ethics Commission.</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-01-08</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/01/kingfish-wins-one-against-dps-at-ethics.html </p>

<p>The Kingfish won a public records fight against the Mississippi Department of Public Safety. The Mississippi Ethics Commission ordered DPS to provide this correspondent with a copy of all correspondence between the agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2016 regarding the DUI enforcement grants. DPS refused to do so as it claimed they were part of an "investigation."</p>

<p>Keep in mind that JJ was asking for correspondence between the state and federal government and not any internal documents pertaining to an investigation. JJ protested and said such correspondence is not part of any investigation. DPS replied "The documents you are requesting are part of the investigation and are exempt from the Open Records Act."</p>

<p>DPS in its arrogance didn't consider there was another government agency at the end of this pipeline. JJ submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The NHTSA provided records that demanded DPS repay $7.4 million in federal DUI-enforcement grants to the federal agency. DPS has never admitted that it received such a demand. Earlier post with much more information about Federal demand for $7.4 million. </p>

<p>The Kingfish filed an complaint with the Ethics Commission. The opinion gives a brief synopsis of the dispute between JJ and DPS:</p>

<p>DPS timely responded to the request, but refused to produce records. DPS’s written response explained that the Mississippi Highway Patrol had been conducting an investigation “into paperwork filed in a federally-funded initiative targeting impaired motorists.” DPS denied the request because of the investigation, stating that “pursuant to exemptions in the Mississippi Public Records Act, DPS cannot release information regarding this investigation at this time.”</p>

<p>Kingfish eventually submitted a similar Federal Freedom of Information Act request to NHTSA which produced in excess of one hundred pages of documents. These documents consist of correspondence between state officials and NHTSA and related documents. Thereafter, Kingfish filed this public records complaint against DPS.</p>

<p>DPS decided to get real cute in its response:</p>

<p>It is clear from the complaint and attached documents that complainant has met with success in obtaining the records he apparently sought as they were available from other sources. Therefore, complainant has not been prohibited from accessing the documents he now complains of not receiving from DPS. Further, as stated in DPS’s email response to complainant’s records request, DPS understood that an investigation was being conducted surrounding the subject area of the request. As such, and without the permission of the investigating agency, DPS did not believe it was clear to release such records that may impact another agency’s investigations [without] the agency’s express authorization. ...</p>

<p>Um, yeah. The Ethics Commission was having none of the DPS malarky. DPS said an agency can't just say something is under investigation. There has to be some limit on this exemption of else a rogue agency could conceivably claim every uncomfortable record is under investigation so it could escape public scrutiny. The order states:</p>

<p>2.3 DPS’s response in this matter fails to explain how the investigative reports exemption applies to the specific records sought by Kingfish. The response does not identify the agency allegedly conducting the investigation or explain how DPS’s records related to the grant program qualify as investigative reports.1 The burden of proof in this matter lies with DPS to establish the exemption applies....</p>

<p>DPS has failed to establish the investigative reports exemption applies to any documents responsive to Kingfish’s request. Based on this record, DPS violated the Act by refusing to produce documents responsive to Kingfish’s public records request.</p>

<p>The Commission approved the order at its December 2017 meeting. Commissioner and former Mississippi Highway Patrol Colonel Don Berry recused himself from the vote.</p>

<p>Kingfish note: DPS provided the records. A separate post will be written about them. The agency has never admitted that the feds want their money back. $7.4 million is a substantial sum of money. The Gutless Wonders at the Legislature need to abandon their conquest of Tico's and demand some answers from Marshall Fisher. They let him skate during last fall's budget hearings and have yet to hold him and his agency accountable. They are elected to oversee our government, and make no mistake, it is our government. The people have a right to know if the state will have to repay millions of dollars due to DPS mismanagement and if troopers were accused of submitting bogus tickets. Legislators need to either start doing their jobs or go home.</p>

<p>As for DPS, it is quite clear there was nothing investigative about the records requested by JJ and DPS was lying through its teeth. DPS hid the fact that the federal government was trying to force Santa Cruz and his cult of cronies to repay $7.1 million for treating DUI enforcement grants as a slush fund. Serve &amp; Protect at the Mississippi Department of Public Safety means DPS leaders serve themselves &amp; protect their asses. There is incompetence and cronyism run amuck at that agency, and this entire fiasco is glaring evidence of it. They are bureaucrats who hide in ratholes behind badges of blue while the politicians look the other way and that my friends, is the bottom line.</p>

<p>While all of this has been going on between the feds and DPS, read the DPS coverage over at the "state newspaper."</p>

<p>MDOC issued the following statement and pictures. </p>

<p>Thursday’s shakedown at Parchman’s Unit 29, the prison’s largest unit, marked the completion of the first round of unannounced searches in the prison system under Operation Zero Tolerance.</p>

<p>The three state prisons, three private prisons, 15 regional facilities, 10 community work centers, four restitution centers and three technical violation centers all can expect the major searches to continue in 2018, Commissioner Pelicia E. Hall said.</p>

<p>“My administration started these major shakedowns in March as a way to decrease the amount of contraband inside our facilities for the safety of our staff and inmates,” Commissioner Hall said. “The amount and types of items found in these last nine months show we must stay on top of keeping these illegal items out of the hands of inmates.”</p>

<p>The last shakedown of the year occurred at a unit with 1,418 inmates, including those on death row and with behavioral problems. Staff from all three prisons and Probation and Parole agents, along with K-9 officers, searched Unit 29 A-L building for several hours.</p>

<p>The seized contraband includes 68 cellphones, 81 cellphone charges, 15 cellphone batteries, 79 homemade weapons, 104 packs of marijuana, 47 packs of methamphetamine, 30 packs of tobacco, 21 packs of spice, 45 cigars, 38 cigarette lighters, 12 bottles of tattoo ink, two tattoo guns, 51 packs of Top paper, six homemade pipes, 16 Sim cards, 14 packs of unmarked pills, three pairs of digital scales, a remote control, and a host of other assorted items.</p>

<p>Commissioner Hall said her administration is aggressively pursuing leads indicating how the contraband items are getting behind prison walls, and will refer the cases to respective district attorneys for prosecution.</p>

<h2 id="medicalboardreleasesfinalopioidamendments">Medical Board releases final opioid amendments</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2017-12-31</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2018/01/medical-board-submits-opioid-amendments.html </p>

<p>The Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure submitted its proposed "Opioid Amendments" to the Secretary of State Friday. They are posted below. The Board proposed the amendments after the Governor's task force on opioid abuse issued several recommendations in September. The amendments have been strongly opposed by many doctors and several health-care provider organizations. A hearing was held on November 15. The Board approved them on December 15 at an unscheduled meeting after giving a public notice less than 48 hours prior to the meeting.</p>

<p>The public has 25 days to submit comments to the Secretary of State for the approved regulations. The amendments will then be submitted to the Occupational Licensing Review Commission. However, the Commission can only alter or reject amendments if it determines that competition in an industry is affected. The legislature created the Commission earlier this year to prevent licensing boards from using their powers to limit competition since such boards are usually comprised of members of the regulated industry. The Governor, Secretary of State, and Attorney General or their appointed designees comprise the Commission (The procedures are posted below.).</p>

<p>The Board of Medical Licensure did make one major change to the amendments. The Board's original proposal would limit the opioid prescriptions to seven days and allow doctors to only renew the prescription for another seven days for acute, non-terminal/non-cancerous pain. The approved amendment expands the restriction to ten days. Rule 1.7(H) of Regulation 2640 states:</p>

<p>When opioids are prescribed for acute pain, the licensee must prescribe the lowest effective dose of immediate release opioids, as the use of long acting opioids for acute non-cancer/non-terminal pain is prohibited. Licensees must prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. Licensees are discourage from prescribing or dispensing more than a three day supply of opioids for acute non-cancer/non-terminal pain, and must not provide greater than a ten day supply for acute non-cancer/non-terminal pain. Licensees may issue an additional ten day supply if clinically necessary, but said supply me be issued in accordance with Title 21 CFR 1306.12 Refilling prescriptions, issuance of multiple prescriptions (i.e. the prescription must be dated on the date of issuance with 'do not fill until' noting the date the prescription may be filled), and such need for an additional ten day supply must be documented in the chart go evidence that no other alternative was appropriate of sufficient to abate the acute pain associated with that medical condition. </p>

<p>Some other major features of the amendments are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Point of service drug testing must be done each time a Schedule II medication is written for the treatment of non-cancer pain (Rule 1.7 (K)). Drug testing must be done every 90 days for patients prescribed benzodiazepines for chronic medical and/or psychiatric conditions as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>*Prescriptions for Benzodiazepines must be limited to a one (I) month supply with no more than two (2) refills. The MPMP must be checked each time a prescription for Benzodiazepines is authorized and evidence of such check must be noted within the patient file. Rule 1.10 (H)</p>

<p>*Physicians must first establish a relationship with the patient before writing any prescription, not just those for controlled substances. A physical exam is required before a relationship can be established. Rule 1.11</p>

<p>*Every doctor, regardless of specialty, must use the PMP upon "initial contact with new patients" and every 90 days afterwards for patients who receive controlled substances. Many doctors protested this amendment as they argued it would add an hour of paperwork to their daily practice and keep them from seeing patients. Several told the Board it takes more than 15 minutes to run a PMP report. The board rejected their arguments and kept the amendment without change.</p>

<p>The amendments also changed the regulations for pain management practices, bariatric medicine, and chronic pain. See earlier post for more information about these changes. </p>

<p>Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey issued the following statement:</p>

<p>Deputy Revives Overdose Victim With “Narcan” </p>

<p>On December 25, 2017 at 7:46 p.m. the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department received a report of an unconscious male at a home in a subdivision in the north part of the county.</p>

<p>Deputy Chance White was dispatched to the residence along with Reservoir Fire and Pafford Ambulance due to the possibility of an overdose.</p>

<p>Deputy White met a female at the residence who stated that her boyfriend had been drinking all day and had been smoking marijuana and taking oxycodone. Deputy White made contact with the unconscious male who was unresponsive and not breathing well. Deputy White administered “Narcan” to reverse the effects of a drug overdose. Shortly after administering the “Narcan”, the victim began breathing stronger and his status improved. Fire and medical personnel arrived on scene and took over treatment.</p>

<p>All Rankin County Deputies have been issued “Narcan” thanks to a grant from the Mississippi Department of Mental Health. This is the first case where a Rankin County Deputy has saved a life using the new drug.</p>

<p>We thank the Department of Mental Health for providing this life saving drug to law enforcement officers across the state at no cost.</p>

<p>State Representative Joel Bomgar (R-Xanadu) told the Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure last month that cutting off opioid prescriptions will kill more Mississippians. He said Mississippi ranked in the top five states for opioid prescriptions but in the bottom ten states for opioid overdoses. He said over 200,000 Mississippians use opioids yet little provision was being made for them once the Board's opioid amendments become law.</p>

<p>Users would switch to either "street drugs or injection drug use and they are going to start dying." Mr. Bomgar said that opioid deaths have risen while opioid prescriptions have fallen since 2010. When the number of prescriptions "stayed flat, opioid deaths stayed flat." His presentation to the board (posted below) stated:</p>

<p>After 2010, there is a near perfect but opposite correlation (-0.99) between the DECREASE in opioid prescriptions and the INCREASEin overall opioid deaths. The correlation is so incredibly close it is eerie. Prescriptions go down, deaths go up. Almost in exact mathematically-mirrored lockstep. With a negative correlation that is that close, you could predict the death rate in future years just by knowing the rate of prescriptions for a given year and forecasting the opposite of that in deaths....</p>

<p>"Supply controls" are killing 4 times as many lives as they are saving. In the absence of universally available Medication Assisted Treatment {MAT) -which all states severely lack, rather than saving lives, our policies are now killing three additional people per 100,000. It is true that one (1) fewer is overdosing on prescription drugs but now four {4) more are overdosing from Heroin or Heroin+ Fentanyl. And in fact, the person who we think we are saving is probably just overdosing on street drugs, so we are not even saving that person....</p>

<p>Thus the lack of a safety net for the addicts means more will die when their supply is cut off. He said Board regulations prevented physicians from using opioids or other drugs to wean users off of drugs or work towards a solution with the patient. The state lacks the facilities to handle the users who will be cut off if they seek treatment. He said "they are about to be pushed off of a cliff and we have no safety net." He said in every state where the supply was turned off, "overdose deaths spiked from that year forward."</p>

<p>The State Representative argued that "we don't have an opioid abuse problem" until prescriptions were reduced in 2010. Opioid overdoses fell in 2009 and 2010 and then rose in subsequent years. The death rate fell in "three of four years leading up to 2012." He said heroin and fenatyl deaths rose at four times the rate of opioid deaths once the opioid prescriptions began to decrease. "We essentially traded one death on opioids for four deaths on heroin and fentanly," Bomgar said.</p>

<p>Several heads in the audience shook their heads in agreement as Mr. Bomgar addressed the board. He said that West Virginia showed what would probably happen in Mississippi is the Board has its way. Mr. Bomgar claimed prescriptions fell 53% while opioid deaths skyrocketed 243% in that state. He said "We have a death problem, not a prescription problem."</p>

<p>The State Representative's address echoed comments made at the same hearing by State Health Officer Dr. Mary Currier. JJ reported on December 12:</p>

<p>Mississippi has a high prescription rate compared to the rest of the country but actually has a low death rate as well "although I know it doesn't seem like that every day." She expressed her concern about the proposed rules creating "unintended consequences." "There is a large group of people who are already addicted," she said. Dr. Currier said over 200,000 Mississippians had opioid prescriptions that were over 30 days.</p>

<p>Dr. Currier is worried that suddenly cutting off the prescriptions to opioid addicts will cause opioid deaths to skyrocket as many will get more deadly drugs from the street. "We will also have more HIV and Hepatitis C out the wazoo," she said.</p>

<p>She pointed out to the medical board that opioid deaths have risen nationwide as opioid prescriptions have been reduced. Dr. Currier predicted that cutting off opioid addicts in Mississippi without a plan for their treatment will cause more opioid deaths. Earlier post. </p>

<p>Lord Protector of the Realm, Jim Hood, issued the following proclamation.</p>

<p>Attorneys General to U.S. Transportation Secretary: Reverse Withdrawal of Rule </p>

<p>JACKSON—Attorney General Jim Hood joined 16 attorneys general in a letter last week asking U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to reverse the department’s decision to withdraw a rule requiring airlines and third-party booking companies to disclose baggage fees and other charges upfront.</p>

<p>The Transportation Department announced earlier this month it was withdrawing the Transparency of Airline Ancillary Service Fees rule, which was proposed during January 2017. The rule would have made it far easier for consumers to understand the full cost of their plane tickets, but the department said in a notice posted online that the rule would have been “of limited public benefit.”</p>

<p>When a customer books a ticket, the baseline price is typically all that is shown. Carry-on baggage fees, checked baggage fees, seat fees, and more are not disclosed until booking is nearly complete—or even after tickets have been purchased. The rule would have required airlines to post all the fees up front at the beginning of the booking process, rather than surprising consumers at the end. U.S. airlines are expected to earn $57 billion from fees this year and $7 billion from baggage fees alone.</p>

<p>“Traveling, especially during the holidays, is stressful enough without hidden fees,” said General Hood. “Consumers should be able to make informed choices about the cost of their travel, and that’s why we’re asking the Transportation Department to demand transparency from the airline industry.”</p>

<p>The letter details the many different fees that airlines are increasingly charging consumers for basic services, which were previously considered standard services covered by the basic ticket price. In addition to baggage fees, some airlines charge for printing boarding passes at the airport, allowing passengers to select seats, and even providing assistance to children traveling by themselves.</p>

<p>According to a 2016 study, travelers paid an average of $100 in fees per round-trip on Spirit airlines, $97 on Frontier, and $86.92 on United. “We regularly hear reports from consumers in our states who are confused and frustrated by these fees, which significantly alter the total cost of travel,” the attorneys general wrote.</p>

<p>The letter also states that while they are committed to working collaboratively with the Transportation Department to protect consumers and ensure the country’s aviation industry is able to grow, “this decision by your Department works against those goals, making it harder for Americans to be informed consumers when they travel.”</p>

<p>In addition to Mississippi, the attorneys general of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia signed last week’s letter.</p>

<h2 id="orthopedicsurgeonsopposenewopioidregs">Orthopedic surgeons oppose new opioid regs</h2>

<p>date: 2017-12-27</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2017/12/orthopedic-surgeons-oppose-new-opioid.html </p>

<p>The Mississippi Society of Orthopedic Surgeons futilely protested the opioid amendments proposed by the Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure. The Board passed the amendments earlier this month. Society President Dr. Kurre Luber said the amendments would violate federal guidelines and force patients to suffer needlessly. A copy of the letter was obtained through a public records request and is posted below. Dr. Luber minced no words in addressing the Board:</p>

<p>On behalf of 140 orthopaedic surgeons providing quality care to patients throughout our state, the Mississippi Orthopaedic Society (MOS), has reviewed the recently approved changes to the MSBML Proposed Changes to Prescribing Regulations. While the MOS shares concerns regarding the misuse and abuse of opioids, we have significant concerns with these regulations as currently written due to the excessive and unrealistic administrative burden these changes would make to our clinical practice of medicine. The measures proposed are not in alignment with the currently accepted prescribing guidelines and practices as established by the DEA and are not in the best interests of our patients.</p>

<p>The Society provides more reasons in opposing the opioid amendments.</p>

<p>*The Board wants to limit patients who suffer from post-surgery pain to seven-day opioid prescriptions and a seven-day refill. The orthopedic surgeons took strong issue with this proposed mandate:</p>

<p>A significant number of post-operative patients require weeks to several months of narcotics after invasive surgery to recover. Federal regulations require that Schedule II substances cannot be called into the pharmacy, which requires a prescription to be directly provided to the patient. This will require weekly prescriptions to all active post-operative patients requiring narcotics. This places an excessive and unrealistic administrative burden on the clinical practice of medicine. This is not in accordance with the current common practice of narcotic prescribing or recommendations of the DEA as referenced from Section V of the DEA Practitioners Manual which states the following concerning Schedule II substances "While some states and many insurance carriers limit the quantity of controlled substances to a 30 day supply, there are no specific federal limits to quantities of drugs dispensed via a prescription".</p>

<p>*Forcing doctors to review the PMP (Prescription Monitoring Program) each time an opioid is prescribed will place "an excessive and unrealistic administrative burden" on practicing medicine. Numerous physicians have stated this requirement will add an hour or more of labor to their individual practices each day. The Board also wants physicians to print out an annual PMP report and keep separately at the office for inspection even though the state already has this report.</p>

<p>*The opioid amendments decree that doctors will prescribe the lowest effective does of "immediate release opioids" and are not able to provide long-acting opioids. This amendment is apparently in direct conflict with federal law. The letter states "As a DEA schedule II registered prescribing physician, this is in direct violation of my Federal </p>

<p>prescribing rights to be denied by the state from judiciously prescribing long acting opioids. It is not appropriate for the MSMBL to dictate what Schedule II substances a physician can provide if appropriate licensed with the DEA."</p>

<p>The Board discussed none of these concerns at the December 15 work session when it approved the amendments.</p>

<p>"Stop the nonsense. Talk to real doctors." (Letters) </p>

<h2 id="medicalboardapprovesopioidamendmentswithlittlenotice">Medical board approves opioid amendments with little notice.</h2>

<p>date: 2017-12-18</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2017/12/medical-board-approves-opioid.html </p>

<p>The Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure approved several amendments to its prescription regulations to combat opioid abuse. The amendments drew no small amount of criticism from doctors as they substantially change how they can prescribe opioids. The Board approved the amendments on a unanimous vote even though the meeting was a work session.</p>

<p>The Board met Friday afternoon with little notice. The Board did not schedule the meeting until Wednesday. It thus did not appear on the schedule of board meetings that is published once a year. The notice was issued Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The main changes to the current regulations are:</p>

<p>*Doctors must not provide greater than a seven day supply for acute non-cancer pain. Licensees may issue an additional seven day supply if clinically necessary. Rule 1.7 (H) A discussion took place on expanding the restriction to ten days for each prescription but no vote was taken.</p>

<p>*Every doctor, regardless of specialty, must use the PMP upon "initial contact with new patients" and every 90 days afterwards for patients who receive controlled substances. Many doctors protested this amendment as they argued it would add an hour of paperwork to their daily practice and keep them from seeing patients. Several told the Board it takes more than 15 minutes to run a PMP report. The board rejected their arguments and kept the amendment without change.</p>

<ul>
<li>Point of service drug testing must be done each time a Schedule II medication is written for the treatment of non-cancer pain (Rule 1.7 (K)). Drug testing must be done every 90 days for patients prescribed benzodiazepines for chronic medical and/or psychiatric conditions as well. This amendment generated the most debate. Board member Dr. Ken Lippincott pushed hard to exempt psychiatrists from the new regulations. However, Dr. Randy Easterling said he opposed the exemption. Dr. Claude Brunson moved to exempt the shrinks but the motion died on a 5-4 vote (1:40:30).</li>
</ul>

<p>*Prescriptions for Benzodiazepines must be limited to a one (I) month supply with no more than two (2) refills. The MPMP must be checked each time a prescription for Benzodiazepines is authorized and evidence of such check must be noted within the patient file. Rule 1.10 (H)</p>

<p>The amendments also changed the regulations for pain management practices, bariatric medicine, and chronic pain. See earlier post for more information about these changes. </p>

<p>The Board approved the amendments on a unanimous vote (9:00 in second video).</p>

<p>The amendments will be posted on the Secretary of State's website for a 28-day public comment period. The Occupational Licensing Board will review the amendments. The Board meets every three months. The amendments will return to the Board of Medical Licensure if the Occupational Licensure Board makes any changes to the amendments. The amendments passed Friday have not yet appeared on the Secretary of State's website.</p>

<p>Kingfish note: Several board members made it quite clear that they were not happy discussing these amendments in public. They seem to have forgotten that it is they who serve the public, not the public who serves them. The rushed meeting with no notice of a vote taking place is very troubling. Many emails and letters were submitted to the Board by Mississippi physicians that were overwhelmingly against these new regulations.</p>

<p>Dr. Easterling defended the Board in an impassioned speech (37:12 in second video):</p>

<p>There seems to be a disconnect and I continue to be amazed by this that someone derived from these rules and regs that you could no longer write for opioids. There is nothing in this that prohibits the responsible, evidence-based writing of opioids for legitimate pain. If asking someone to jump through a few extra hoops prevents them from doing it, shame on them.... There are things you do and we arrived at this epidemic in large measure because the writing of these medications in large number unnecessarily has resulted in the number one public health crisis in this country. So what this board and other boards across the country, and don't think for one minute we are the only board doing this, what we are saying is if you want to treat chronic, non-cancer pain with opioids, this is what you must do under certain circumstances. If you do it, fine, keep doing it, but people don't want to hear that. People want to hear that this board is stopping you from doing something. There is nothing in here that says if someone comes into the emergency room you can't give them dilaudid or morphine. There is nothing that says if you have a total hip, you can't go home with 20 days and if you need more, go back to your doctor for another 20 days. I just think my experience in dealing with this for the last year or so a lot of the comments that are being made in the press and otherwise are irresponsible, they're not what we are saying, and we just ought to stand up and tell the truth. We just ought to say what the rules say and let it be. If a doctor decides they are not going to follow the rules and let their patients go without treatment for chronic pain, that is unfortunate, in my opinion. </p>

<p>All JJ is doing is posting the regs. Any coverage is based on those regs.</p>

<p>29:30: Rule 1.7 discussion begins. 7-day limit for opioid prescriptions for acute, non-terminal pain. </p>

<p>1:10: Discussion on drug testing. </p>

<p>1:12: Discussion begins on exempting psychiatrists from drug testing requirements (Rule 1.7(K)).</p>

<p>The Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure adopted proposed amendments to regulations that govern prescriptions this afternoon on a unanimous vote today at a work session. The Board discussed the amendments but made few changes to them during the 2 1/2 hour session. A motion to exempt psychiatric patients from drug testing failed on a vote of 5-4. Video will be posted later. The amendments will be submitted to the Secretary of State for public comments. After that public comment period expires, the Occupational License Board will review the the amendments and can amend the amendments. That board meets every quarter. The amendments will be returned to the Board of Medical Licensure if the Occupational License Board amends the amendments. Did everyone get that?</p>

<p>The Mississippi Board of Medical Licensure announced yesterday that it will meet Friday at 1:00 PM. The only topic on the agenda are the proposed "Opioid Amendments." The same amendments that drew heavy opposition from Mississippi doctors.</p>

<p>The Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure wants to make it tougher for doctors to prescribe opioids. The Board proposed the new regulations in response to recommendations made by Governor Phil Bryant's task force on opioid abuse that were released in August.* Earlier post. The rules will limit surgery patients to opioid prescriptions for only two weeks. Weight loss and pain management clinics face new rules. More paperwork is recommended for the doctors.</p>

<p>Section 2640 of the Board's administrative code governs the prescription, dispensing, and administration of medication. The Board proposed submitted amendments to the Secretary of State that would overhaul Section 2640 on September 21 in response to the opioid "crisis." The proposed amendments received a great deal of attention from doctors as it will make some major changes in how they practice medicine if adopted. A hearing was held on November 15 at the Board's offices. Over 150 people attended the 5 hour-long hearing. The next regular board meeting is not scheduled to take place until January. Some major proposed changes are:</p>

<p>*Doctors can only write opioid prescriptions for seven days and a refill for another seven days for non-cancerous or non-terminal pain. The new restrictions apply to post-surgery pain.</p>

<p>*Every doctor, regardless of specialty, must use the PMP upon "initial contact with new patients" and every 90 days afterwards for patients who receive controlled substances.</p>

<p>*Patients must be drug-tested each time a schedule II medication is prescribed. </p>

<p>*Pain management practices must be at least 50% owned by a Mississippi-licensed physicians AND the physician must practice in Mississippi at least 20 hours per week.</p>

<p>*A physical exam AND a doctor-patient relationship must be established for ALL prescriptions, not just controlled substances. This will substantially affect telemedicine companies (1.11).</p>

<p>Read this earlier post for more information of the proposed Opioid amendments. </p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<p>Officer originally responded to the Jubilee gas station at the corner of Lynch St. and Hwy 80 for what was believed to be a gunshot victim. Upon their arrival, Officers found a silver sedan stopped on the intersection which had sustained heavy front end damage. Officers later learned that several shots had been fired at the vehicle prior to the accident as well as shortly after the accident and a 38-year-old male had left that vehicle and ran to the Jubilee where someone contact Police, assuming that he had been shot.</p>

<p>Information was later obtained that the initial incident stemmed from an altercation between the occupants of the silver sedan and the occupants of a dark red sedan in the parking lot of the Texaco gas station, also on Lynch St., just east of the Jubilee. Both vehicle left the lot as several shots were fired and the red sedan appeared to be pursing the silver sedan. As the silver sedan traveled west on Lynch St. and approached the Hwy 80 intersection at a very high rate of speed, it violently collided with the rear of a gray vehicle which was stationary at the traffic light, forcing it into the intersection. Three individuals exited the silver sedan; one appeared to be a female who got into a red two-door vehicle that was stopped at the light, before fleeing east on Hwy 80. At that time, the red vehicle that was in pursuit, stop in the intersection just past the wreck and fired shots at the remaining occupants before continuing further on Lynch St. away from the scene. One of the occupants, a black male, ran to the vehicle they had collided with and forced the female driver out at gunpoint. He then took her vehicle and fled at a high rate of speed west on Hwy 80. The third occupant, also a black male, ran to the Jubilee along with the carjacked female. </p>

<p>The male suffered lacerations to the head that appeared to have been caused during the accident and not from gunfire. He was transported for his injures and is said to be in stable condition.</p>

<p>The carjacked vehicle was a gray 2005 Chevy Impala, believed to have been taken by a black male suspect, known only as “Lil J”. The license plate of that vehicle is, WBJ785 (Warren Co. MS tag). </p>

<p>It was unknown if this incident is related to the two early morning shootings that occurred on First Ave. and again on Capital St. That possibility has not yet been ruled out but there is not enough information, at this time, to make that determination. </p>

<p>date: 2017-12-05</p>

<p>url: http://kingfish1935.blogspot.com/2017/12/ethics-commission-recommends-fining.html </p>

<p>Three Hinds County Election Commissioners might have to pay $250 fines for violating the Open Meetings Act. The Mississippi Ethics Commission recommended fining Commissioners Yvonne Horton, Toni Johnson, and James Reed after it determined that they held a meeting without notifying the other Commissioners nor the public.</p>

<p>The Ethics Commission stated in its proposed finding of fact:</p>

<p>Little alleges three members (a quorum) of the Election Commission convened a special meeting, without providing any notice to the other two commission members or the public, to discuss the compensation of the Election Commission for management of the recent local municipal elections. The complaint alleges the three commission members who met in private changed the amount of compensation the Election Commission had previously decided upon (in a March meeting) to pay themselves more for their municipal election duties....</p>

<p>The Commissioners claimed it all happened by accident:</p>

<p>In its response, the Election Commission maintains the meeting Little referred to in her complaint was a chance meeting by the three commissioners, excluded under the Open Meetings Act. The response states, “In accordance with Code 25-41-17, Chance Meetings, Social Gatherings are excluded from the Open Meetings Act, Commissioners Johnson, Reed and Horton declare that at this chance meeting, invoices, ballots and the upcoming E Camp (sic) were discussed.”1 The response does not directly address a private meeting by the three commissioners concerning their compensation, which is the only specific subject identified in the open meetings complaint.</p>

<p>They didn't help their case when the aggrieved Commissioner taped a conversation and provided a copy to the Ethics Commission:</p>

<p>Little submitted supplemental information in the form of an audi recording of a private conversation between Commissioners Summers, Horton and Johnson.... Based on the recording, Summers, who did not attend the private meeting which is the subject of this complaint, recorded her conversation with Horton and Johnson, who did attend the private meeting. On the audio recording Horton, who serves as the chairman of the Election Commission, admits she met with Reed and Johnson outside of an open meeting. She also admits the meeting was not properly noticed and that no minutes were taken of the meeting. On the audio recording, Chairman Horton states, “I think the money was fair but the way it was done . . . no, I think we should have done a meeting.” Commissioner Summers responds, “so, I don’t think any of it was fair, I think it was done under the table in a way that was not transparent . . . . [I] think that it’s unfortunate and shameful that you all would make a decision like that without at least being open to communicating what was happening . . . . I think the fact that you went against what was already in the [March] minutes speaks to your integrity as an elected official.” Chairman Horton replies, “it probably does… and I agree with you.” The audio recording establishes that three commission members determined their compensation outside the presence of the other two commissioners and the public. On the audio recording Chairman Horton attempts to justify the private meeting by explaining to Summers that the three commissioners could have made the same decision in a properly noticed public meeting.</p>

<p>The recording came back to bite the three Commissioners in the you know where when the Ethics Commission got around to determining guilt. The proposed order states:</p>

<p>2.4 The record in this case demonstrates three members of the election commission gathered and discussed a matter under their jurisdiction without providing proper notice, allowing public access, or keeping minutes as required by the Act.</p>

<p>The proposed order recommends fining each of the three Commissioners $500 but suspending half of the fine if no future violations are committed. They can submit objections up to five days after receiving a copy of the proposed order. The Ethics Commission will hold a hearing on Tuesday, December 19, 2017 at 10:00 AM.</p>

<p>Wrestling returns, except this time it will be a Battle Royal with Othor Cain, Ben Allen, Kim Wade, Haley Fisackerly, Alan Lange, and “Big Cat” Donna Ladd all in the ring at the same time. The Battle Royal will be in a steel cage, no time limit, no referee, and the losers must leave town. Marshand Crisler will be the honorary referee (as it gives him a title without actually having to do anything). </p>

<p>Meet KIM Waaaaaade at the Entergy Tent. For five pesos, Kim will sell you a chance to win a deed to a crack house on Ridgeway Street stuffed in the Howard Industries pinata. Don't worry if the pinata is beaten to shreds, as Mr. Wade has Jose, Emmanuel, and Carlos, all illegal immigrants, available as replacements for the it. Upon leaving the Entergy tent, fig leaves will be available in case Entergy literally takes everything you have as part of its Trollfest ticket price adjustment charge.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd of The Jackson Free Press will give several classes on learning how to write. Smearing, writing without factchecking, and reporting only one side of a story will be covered. A donation to pay their taxes will be accepted and she will be signing copies of their former federal tax liens. Ms. Ladd will give a dramatic reading of her two award-winning essays (They received The Jackson Free Press "Best Of" awards.) "Why everything is always about me" and "Why I cover murders better than anyone else in Jackson".</p>

<p>In the spirit of helping those who are less fortunate, Trollfest '09 adopts a cause for which a portion of the proceeds and donations will be donated: Keeping Frank Melton in his home. The “Keep Frank Melton From Being Homeless” booth will sell chances for five dollars to pin the tail on the jackass. John Reeves has graciously volunteered to be the jackass for this honorable excursion into saving Frank's ass. What's an ass between two friends after all? If Mr. Reeves is unable to um, perform, Speaker Billy McCoy has also volunteered as when the word “jackass” was mentioned he immediately ran as fast as he could to sign up. </p>

<p>In order to help clean up the legal profession, Adam Kilgore of the Mississippi Bar will be giving away free, round-trip plane tickets to the North Pole where they keep their bar complaint forms (which are NOT available online). If you don't want to go to the North Pole, you can enjoy Brant Brantley's (of the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance) free guided tours of the quicksand field over by High Street where all complaints against judges disappear. If for some reason you are unable to control yourself, never fear; Judge Houston Patton will operate his jail where no lawyers are needed or allowed as you just sit there for minutes... hours.... months...years until he decides he is tired of you sitting in his jail. Do not think Judge Patton is a bad judge however as he plans to serve free Mad Dog 20/20 to all inmates.</p>

<p>Trollfest '09 is a pet-friendly event as well. Feel free to bring your dog with you and do not worry if your pet gets hungry, as employees of the Jackson Zoo will be on hand to provide some of their animals as food when it gets to be feeding time for your little loved one.</p>

<h2 id="smallustownbansgayprideparadenowtargetedbynationstoplgbtactivistgroups">Small U.S. town bans ‘Gay Pride’ parade, now targeted by nation’s top LGBT activist groups</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-02-26</p>

<p>url: https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/small-u.s.-town-threatened-with-lawsuit-after-denying-request-for-gay-pride </p>

<p>Shutterstock.com</p>

<p>STARKVILLE, Mississippi, February 26, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) – A small town in Mississippi turned down a parade permit for homosexuals, who in response are filing a lawsuit and creating a national uproar.</p>

<p>Starkville city council voted 4-3 on Tuesday the 20th against a special event request to host and pay for accommodating the first celebration of homosexuality through their main streets.</p>

<p>Attending the Starkville council meeting were members of the community speaking against the parade.</p>

<p>“If anything should be held up and down our streets, it should not be this,” resident Dorothy Isaac said. “Do not turn our city into a sin city.”</p>

<p>“This is a very inclusive, a very friendly place, a very friendly city, a very friendly county, but every city has to have limits,” Rev. Thomas Rogers of Josey Creek Missionary Baptist Church stated. “Cities without walls are easily taken.” He noted that the parade organizers asked for a “special privilege.”</p>

<p>“God made Adam and Eve,” Isaac reminded the council.</p>

<p>Homosexual activists, including representatives from Mississippi State University who traveled two hours and a hundred miles to attend the seven-member board meeting, portrayed the gay and lesbian festival as a unifying event.</p>

<p>“This is something that will bind this community together,” Starkville Pride’s Alexandra Hendon said.</p>

<p>As things turned out, she couldn’t have been more wrong. The small town of 28,000, now virtually torn in two, has become the focus of national controversy and Starkville Pride has promised a lawsuit against the city.</p>

<p>Lesbian organizer Bailey McDaniel had said that the event was meant to be for everyone.</p>

<p>“We want you to join us,” she said to residents.</p>

<p>Upon hearing the vote, McDaniel, who was standing beside her lesbian partner Emily Turner, burst into tears. McDaniel’s photograph was sympathetically published far and wide along with the story of the town denying the homosexual parade.</p>

<p>Having been turned down, Starkville Pride contacted the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Human Rights Campaign and the Southern Poverty Law Center to bring a lawsuit against the city.</p>

<p>Lawyer Roberta Kaplan, a veteran of homosexual lawsuits forcing compliance among a resistant Mississippi citizenry, said she will be quick to file against the city, according to the Starkville Daily News.</p>

<p>“Gay Pride” parades have a history of being obscene and offensive. The events often include hypersexual dancing, people who engage in mock-sex acts, as well as naked and partially naked men and women. In many states, local governments have the right to deny events that violate community standards, but such local rights are shrinking.</p>

<p>The ACLU responded to the vote Wednesday, warning the board that its decision “violates the Constitution.” Mississippi ACLU Executive Director Jennifer Riley-Collins issued a statement calling the city council’s vote “disturbing” and demanded the board “reconsider...and approve the request.”</p>

<p>In 2016 the state enacted the “Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act,” which protects citizens and businesses from punishment by the government if they decline to provide specialty services for homosexual ceremonies.</p>

<p>Governor Phil Bryant took a lot of media and corporate heat for signing the law, which also protects state employees who don't support homosexuality by ensuring they can't be fired for expressing their beliefs outside the office. Some states banned official travel to Mississippi in protest.</p>

<p>In January, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the law to stand by refusing to take up the case on appeal. Previously, the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also upheld the law by overruling an Obama-appointed lower court's injunction against it.</p>

<p>Kaplan fought against it.</p>

<h2 id="correctionssecretarypledgesnoprivateprisons">Corrections Secretary Pledges No Private Prisons</h2>

<p>by: Nicholas Garton</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-10</p>

<p>url: https://madison365.com/corrections-secretary-pledges-no-private-prisons/ </p>

<p>Wisconsin Department of Corrections Secretary Jon Litscher stated emphatically that he will not ever use private prisons in the state of Wisconsin. Secretary Litscher’s position on prison privatization was being questioned by leaders of Madison based community organizers who were concerned about the use of private prisons after a series of scandals involving privatized prisons in Mississippi.</p>

<p>“As long as I am Secretary we will not use private prisons,” Litscher said in an email exchange with community leaders on Thursday.</p>

<p>It was the strongest Litscher has stated publicly on the topic of private prisons in Wisconsin. In 2017 Madison365 reported that Litscher had broached the topic of prison privatization while addressing a State Assembly committee. At that time Litscher had stated that using private prisons would be a last resort if the prison population continued to grow and there was nowhere else to put inmates.</p>

<p>Litscher continues to be concerned about the steady growth in the prison population but indicated he would not seek the use of private facilities.</p>

<p>DOC Spokesman Tristan Cook confirmed Litscher’s position to Madison365 on Monday morning.</p>

<p>“As we have indicated previously, the Department sees no need to use private prisons and has no interest in doing so,” Cook told Madison365.</p>

<p>Last week private prisons in Mississippi came under national scrutiny after a video showed prison guards not responding to a gang beating another inmate. In the video an inmate is seen being assaulted by several other prisoners while the prison guards took over 30 minutes to respond to the incident.</p>

<p>Inmates at East Mississippi Correctional Facility, which is privately run by Management &amp; Training Corporation, resorted to setting fires in their cells in order to force guards to respond to normal security situations. Inmates also reportedly crafted knives and other weapons to protect themselves because guards were not able to, and lived under grotesque physical conditions due to the uncleanliness of the facility.</p>

<p>In Wisconsin, all prison facilities are owned and operated by the state. Prison guards are state employees and typically respond quickly to security situations. Violence against fellow inmates is not tolerated, units are fully staffed and day-to-day the majority of inmates are in relatively safe and clean environments.</p>

<p>In privately run facilities, however, this is often not the case. Private corporations have minimum inmate quotas, which means the state agrees to fill approximately 1,000 beds on average. The facilities are often poorly staffed and are not physically designed in the same way State run facilities in Wisconsin are. In Wisconsin, correctional officers are in direct contact with inmates at every moment, which is often not the case in private facilities.</p>

<p>Prison overcrowding in Wisconsin has reached peak levels as a result of truth-in-sentencing laws that cause prisoners to serve 100 percent of their sentences and not be eligible for parole. Prisoners sentenced before 2000 are generally eligible for parole because they were incarcerated under different guidelines that allow parole after they have done two-thirds of their time. Governor Scott Walker has greatly reduced the Parole Commission during his tenure, however, slowing to a trickle the number of inmates being released even under the older guidelines.</p>

<p>It is those policies that concern proponents of prison reform, such as The Prison Ministry Project Director Jerry Hancock, himself a former prosecutor. Hancock points out that major portions of the prison population could be safely released back into the community. The continued use of prison to house people struggling with addiction or poverty-based offenses is driving up the number of inmates.</p>

<p>The prison overcrowding that even Secretary Litscher has expressed concern about is a self-inflicted issue on the part of the Walker administration that many community leaders like Hancock feel is more the result of non-release policies than the result of some overwhelming crime wave in the community.</p>

<p>The concern is very real that Governor Walker would use overcrowding as justification to pursue privatized, for-profit prisons in Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Thus, hearing Secretary Litscher adamant about not using private prisons has alleviated the concerns expressed by community leaders like Hancock.</p>

<p>“Secretary Litscher’s promise that ‘as long as I am Secretary we will not use private prisons’ proves that he is a man of conscience and compassion,” Hancock told Madison365 on Wednesday. “It is also a clear message to the Governor that he can have private prisons or Jon Litscher but he can’t have both.”</p>

<p>url: http://www.meridianstar.com/news/local<em>news/detained-delayed-and-disabled/article</em>b74b937b-8b1b-58f4-a91f-685f82e1c7bf.html </p>

<p>Police arrested CL in December of 2013 and his friend, JM, one month later. The men, both homeless, had been accused of multiple charges of uttering forgery, more commonly known as writing bad checks.</p>

<p>The two men, who may no longer be prosecuted for their crimes considering their mental illnesses, are not being identified by their full names by The Meridian Star. Their cases provide an example of how a crime committed by people with a serious mental illness can prevent them from receiving the help they need.</p>

<p>A report Feb. 11 in The Meridian Star explored long delays for defendants accused of a crime, some waiting more than three years for a trial. For defendants with a mental illness, the wait for justice can be even longer.</p>

<p>Both CL and JM have severe mental illnesses and couldn't be convicted of a crime until their competency was restored, meaning until they could understand their own charges and assist their attorneys. Through their public defenders these men petitioned the state to provide a mental health evaluation, which took a year to grant.</p>

<p>Each man waited nearly four years in the Lauderdale County Detention Facility, not a mental health facility, waiting on a lengthy, state-wide list to receive their much-needed treatment at the state hospital.</p>

<p>CL’s attorney requested an evaluation and treatment on Aug. 26, 2014.</p>

<p>On Oct. 8, 2015, CL was ordered to seek treatment and commit to Whitfield, the only state hospital that provides competency restoration for criminal defendants. He didn’t formally receive treatment, however, until late 2017.</p>

<p>By November, CL had been transferred to Whitfield. He had spent at least 730 days waiting for his treatment.</p>

<p>The delay cost Lauderdale County more than $49,600, according to a decade-old cost estimate from the state that said it cost $68/ day to house a defendant.</p>

<p>JM’s attorney submitted a motion for an evaluation and treatment on Oct. 17, 2014 and he was ordered to treatment nearly a year later on Oct. 14, 2015.</p>

<p>JM left the Lauderdale County Detention Facility on Feb. 20, more than two years after being ordered to treatment.</p>

<p>His 860-day wait cost the county an estimated $58,480.</p>

<p>Court slowdown</p>

<p>John C. Helmert Jr., a former Lauderdale County public defender, served as the public defender for JM briefly and shared some court details that bogged the case down.</p>

<p>Criminal cases are handled in the Circuit Court while cases dealing with mental health issues or involuntary commitments are handled by the Chancery Court. When defendants with a mental illness want to plead as incompetent to stand trial, the line between the two courts blurs.</p>

<p>Submitted photo</p>

<p>“It’s unclear how the issues mesh between courts,” Helmert said. “If you have people who are not competent, who are mentally ill to the point where they don’t know or they can’t assist their own lawyer in preparation of the defense they can be declared incompetent by a court — which means that they cannot be tried.”</p>

<p>Helmert warned, however, being ruled incompetent doesn’t help defendants get treatment.</p>

<p>“But just saying they can’t be tried doesn’t cure the problem and it doesn’t get them out of the jail… if a court finds they need to be taken to a facility and treated until their competency is restored, even in those very rare circumstances where that happens, the Mississippi State Hospital at Whitfield is so backed up that it takes years to get them there,” Helmert said.</p>

<p>In the case of his former client, JM, Helmert said he couldn’t get him moved further up the waiting list.</p>

<p>“People like him have to sit in county jails, treated like criminals and maybe he is a criminal, but he hasn’t been found to be one, but because he has mental health problems he has to sit there longer than people who do not have mental health problems,” Helmert said. “This position is really just mistreating people who have already been mistreated by society and by other individuals, (people who have been) used for other people’s gains. It’s just mistreating him further.”</p>

<p>Additionally, studies suggest that spending time in jail hurts those suffering from a mental illness.</p>

<p>“People like him have to sit in county jails, treated like criminals and maybe he is a criminal, but he hasn’t been found to be one, but because he has mental health problems he has to sit there longer than people who do not have mental health problems."</p>

<p>–John C. Helmert Jr., public defender</p>

<p>"Holding people ... who have been found to have severe mental health disabilities, is particularly egregious because there is a long and deep well of academic literature that makes it clear that the conditions of confinement that you find in jail exacerbate mental illness," said Paloma Wu, legal director of the ACLU of Mississippi, in an Oct. 2016 report about Chancery Court (non-criminal) commitments.</p>

<p>If ever convicted, CL and JM could return to society without going to prison, or receive a sentence for ‘time served.’</p>

<p>In October, Helmert said, “(JM) is completely incompetent at this point and desperately in need of that mental health treatment.”</p>

<p>Whitfield: The current model</p>

<p>Philip Gaines, the court liaison coordinator of forensic services at Mississippi’s State Hospital in Whitfield said the hospital had added new staff and decreased the waiting time from previous years.</p>

<p>In 2015, the state had 110-150 pending evaluation orders. In 2017, the hospital had 39 waiting for an evaluation and a waiting list of three to four months.</p>

<p>The hospital has 35 beds for patients in need of forensic services, which restores competency and treats severe mental illnesses. Fifteen of those beds are reserved for pre-trial competency restoration while the remaining beds treat those found guilty by reason of insanity and those committed to treatment by a Chancery Court.</p>

<p>Submitted photo</p>

<p>“There is an effort underway to change that by increasing the number of restoration beds,” Gaines said. "We are looking for ways that increase our ability to do more competency restoration.”</p>

<p>The other 20 beds are less restrictive, Gaines said, but the institution might attempt to convert some of those beds to pre-trial competency restoration beds.</p>

<p>If, during their treatment at Whitfield, a defendant’s competence cannot be restored, then the defendant cannot be convicted and will be committed to treatment in the least restrictive environment fitting for their specific case.</p>

<p>Gaines said 39 defendants across the state were waiting for an evaluation with an average wait time of three to four months.</p>

<p>Another 60 inmates, already evaluated and ruled not competent, were waiting for a bed at the hospital. On average, those defendants waited 13 months.</p>

<p>Gaines said treatment could be delayed because courts may not be aware of someone struggling with a mental illness in jail and thus haven’t signed any orders.</p>

<p>Or these orders may not be submitted promptly after a defendant’s arrest. While each case is unique, some are delayed by incomplete paperwork, something that can delay cases such as CL and JM.</p>

<p>Though Gaines couldn’t confirm CL's and JM’s records, due to medical privacy laws, he did discuss the challenges of incomplete paperwork. Often, someone struggling with a severe mental illness without a home won't carry their paperwork with them, making it difficult for caretakers to track down their past.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, (if there’s a history of mental illness) they may have been in five different states at several different hospitals,” Gaines said. “If we can have their records, we can see what medications have worked in the past.”</p>

<p>Records could also clarify cases where evaluators may suspect malingering, or feigning an illness to avoid incarceration.</p>

<p>“I’ve had (doctors) tell me, ‘I think this might be a case of malingering, but if I had their records I could compare those (notes) and it would give me greater insight,’ “ Gaines said.</p>

<p>“Sometimes, (if there’s a history of mental illness) they may have been in five different states at several different hospitals. If we can have their records, we can see what medications have worked in the past.”</p>

<p>–Philip Gaines, court liaison coordinator of forensic services</p>

<p>In addition to exploring the possibility of more competency beds, Gaines said a pilot program in Hinds and Madison County had explored the possibilities of jail-based competency restoration programs, which could reduce the delay.</p>

<p>For a defendant’s competency to be restored at the state hospital, the Mississippi Department of Mental Health estimated it cost $10,000 a month to treat one person. However, through a program with the Region 8 Community Mental Health Center, the department planned to reduce that cost to $1,200 by providing those services to defendants currently in jail.</p>

<p>These defendants, waiting for an availability at the state hospital, receive some treatment and education about the legal system from trained social workers at the Region 8 center while at their local jail.</p>

<p>The report from the Department of Mental Health said it reduced costs with the program by restoring competency to some individuals and shortening the length of treatment at the state hospital for others.</p>

<p>Of the 15 who entered the program, three were re-evaluated and found to be competent, saving the state hospital thousands in treatment, according to a release from the Department of Mental Health.</p>

<p>Gaines added, however, that it may be difficult to implement the system in more rural counties with less resources or trained professionals.</p>

<p>“(In Region 8), it has already paid for itself in savings,” Gaines said.</p>

<p>Lauderdale County District 2 Supervisor Wayman Newell sat in the audience of the open government forum Thursday and experienced a flashback to one of the most blatant examples of local government in Mississippi breaking the law related to open meetings.</p>

<p>. seek to previous </p>

<p>12… 6 seek to 10%, 20% … 60% </p>

<p>More than seven years ago, Newell and other members of the Lauderdale County Board of Supervisors entered an executive session to discuss a personnel issue but also discussed something not approved for a topic during the closed session.</p>

<p>The matter may not have been made public if the county hadn’t recorded the meeting, including the executive session, and a copy of the recording made it to The Meridian Star.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a happy thing for me, I tell you that,” said Newell, who sat on the second row of Thursday's forum, which was sponsored by The Meridian Star and the Mississippi Press Association Education Foundation.</p>

<p>A public rebuke by the Mississippi Ethics Commission included strong language criticizing the officials for hiding behind closed doors to discuss raising garbage fees.</p>

<p>“Each and every member of the Lauderdale County Board of Supervisors violated the public trust by engaging in that discussion behind closed doors,” Mississippi Ethics Commission Executive Director Tom Hood wrote on Jan. 7, 2011.</p>

<p>Listening to Hood discuss that case, Newell said he has tried to learn valuable lessons from the experience.</p>

<p>“I have brought up several times that we must stay on topic,” Newell said after the forum Thursday.</p>

<p>Photo by Paula Merritt / The Meridian Star</p>

<p>This case study provides an example of why open government advocates decided to hold the forum for public officials and the public.</p>

<p>“It’s all about accountability,” Hood said before the meeting, which was held at the Rosenbaum Health Sciences Building at MSU's Riley Campus. “In a democracy, all public officials are accountable to the people they serve.”</p>

<p>Hood and longtime open government attorney Leonard Van Slyke spoke during the forum, answering questions and walking the audience through hypothetical scenarios related to public records open meetings.</p>

<p>While the issue with the Lauderdale County supervisors discussing raising trash pickup fees behind closed doors made for an obvious violation of state law, other questions related to open records laws that aren’t always easy to answer.</p>

<p>Ruth Jones listens during the forum on open government Thursday.</p>

<p>For example, there is an ongoing debate about police body cameras, which often record much more than police arresting suspects. They also record people, even young children not associated with criminal activity.</p>

<p>“Body cameras end up capturing all sorts of scenarios we never thought about,” Hood said.</p>

<p>Van Slyke said he believes most public officials have the public in mind but sees open government laws as essential to public understanding and access to information.</p>

<p>“Public records" shall mean all books, records, papers, accounts, letters, maps, photographs, films, cards, tapes, recordings or reproductions thereof, and any other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, having been used, being in use, or prepared, possessed or retained for use in the conduct, transaction or performance of any business, transaction, work, duty or function of any public body, or required to be maintained by any public body.</p>

<p>“There are, unfortunately, those who don’t want to do the right thing, especially if what they’re doing is controversial and want to hide,” Van Slyke said.</p>

<p>Mississippi Department of Corrections</p>

<p>The death of Johnny Hall Jr., a 35-year-old prisoner serving 30 years at Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, is the eighth at a state prison so far this year.</p>

<p>That total is more than all the inmate deaths in 2016, when six inmates died in prison, and more than double the number of deaths in all of 2015, when there were three, according to an analysis of information released by the Mississippi Department of Corrections.</p>

<p>A press release issued Wednesday states that Hall was found unresponsive in his cell at Parchman on July 4 and pronounced dead around 6:35 a.m. That release also states that Hall was convicted on four different occasions, including for burglary, escape and fleeing law enforcement.</p>

<p>Johnny Hall Jr. was found unresponsive in his cell the morning of July 4, 2017</p>

<p>The state prison agency said the cause and manner of Hall’s death are pending an autopsy and investigation.</p>

<p>His death comes three months after three prisoners died in a one-week span at Parchman, from April 11 to April 14.</p>

<p>On April 15, Randy Bevill died at Bolivar County Medical. He was convicted of the 1986 murder of an 18-year-old jogger named Amy Clayton.</p>

<p>Billy T. Bonner, 78, a former justice court judge convicted of rape in 2013 died at the Parchman hospital on April 14.</p>

<p>Maral Gartney, 20, died April 11 and was serving a 10-year sentence on charges of shooting into a dwelling and a motor vehicle.</p>

<p>The agency’s investigations into those deaths are ongoing so commenting would be premature, said department spokesperson Grace Fisher. Death certificates, which state causes of death, are not public under Mississippi’s open-records law.</p>

<p>Blake Feldman, the advocacy coordinator for the ACLU of Mississippi, said the rate of deaths so far this year is “incredibly alarming.”</p>

<p>“It looks like there’s a very alarming spike in the past year. It would be very troubling to learn that MDOC isn’t concerned and isn’t looking at how to keep people in their care alive,” Feldman said.</p>

<p>Sarah Norwood, the younger sister of Maral Gartney, said he seemed to despair towards the end of his life, doubting whether he would ever make it out of prison even though he was eligible for parole later this year.</p>

<p>In a letter he wrote to family members in late March, she said Gartney described an experience of his body warming while reading the Bible, as if possessed by a demon, so he kept reading hoping to exorcise to spirit. A short time later, Gartney was pronounced dead at a prison hospital.</p>

<p>“It hurt me because he was so ready to get out. He gave so many years for him to die right there,” Norwood told Mississippi Today.</p>

<p>In a report published in 2015, the Bureau of Justice Statistics analyzed mortality in local jails and prisons between 2000 and 2013. The agency’s analysis found that overall the number of deaths in local or state prisons was on the rise, increasing for three consecutive years.</p>

<p>Mississippi’s prison mortality rate, in which analysts calculated state and federal inmates, has been erratic over the years, according to the justice statistics data. In 2013, the last year analysts examined, 68 inmates died in state and federal facilities in Mississippi — a jump from 41 the previous year.</p>

<p>The ACLU’s Feldman is unfamiliar with the circumstances of the prison deaths that have occurred this year, but says the state is financially ill-equipped to guarantee the health of safety of inmates.</p>

<p>For the fiscal year that began July 1, the Legislature appropriated $310 million to the department of corrections.</p>

<p>“MDOC doesn’t have enough funding to take care of 20,000 people. Our prison system is so big and the funding that is provided for a uniquely large prison population puts our state at the level of egregiousness seen in private prisons,” he added.</p>

<p>The ACLU, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center, have a class-action lawsuit pending against the state over access to health-care services and violent conditions at East Mississippi Correctional Facility, the privately run state prison in Meridian.</p>

<p>A trial is set for January 2018.</p>

<h2 id="acluwantsstatewidepolicyonbodycamerasforofficers">ACLU wants statewide policy on body cameras for officers</h2>

<p>url: http://www.mpbonline.org/blogs/news/2018/01/09/aclu-wants-statewide-policy-on-body-cameras-for-officers/ </p>

<p>A civil rights organization in Mississippi is asking for a statewide policy to regulate the use of police body-worn cameras. The ACLU says police and sheriffs departments across the state have different policies. MPB's Ashley Norwood reports.</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi is hoping legislators will pass a law outlining uniform guidelines for law enforcement officers using body-worn cameras. The organization reviewed the policies of 65 police and sheriffs departments. They found none require individuals to be notified that they are being recorded. Also, officers can review camera footage before submitting a report of an incident, and recordings with major public interest, such as an officer-involved shooting, can be withheld from the public.</p>

<p>Blake Felderman is with the ACLU of Mississippi.</p>

<p>"The state legislature needs to establish a minimum policy that balancing privacy rights and transparency, accountability with privacy rights of officers also," said Felderman.</p>

<p>Ken Winter is the executive director of the Mississippi Association of Chiefs of Police. He says the association does not support the ACLU on this and neither should lawmakers.</p>

<p>"The policies that the agencies have in place meet the legal and lawful parameters of the constitution. What the ACLU talking about people how have been videoed should have the right to view this or that, well actually no they don't," said Winter.</p>

<p>According to the survey conducted by the ACLU, at least 10 departments in Mississippi are using body-worn cameras without a written policy in place.</p>

<p>JACKSON, MS (Mississippi News Now) -</p>

<p>Wednesday morning's gunfire between Jackson police officers and citizens resulted in the city's latest officer involved shooting investigation.</p>

<p>There's now a new way JPD will handle this and future investigations.</p>

<p>Surveillance cameras will likely be used in Wednesday's deadly officer involved shooting investigation.</p>

<p>Police officers in the Capital City do not have body cameras or dash cams to record incidents like these.</p>

<p>Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes is continuing the push for body cameras for the state's largest police force.</p>

<p>Recently, council members met with the Greater Jackson Chamber of Commerce in hopes of getting business support to help finance cameras for the 350 member force.</p>

<p>No financial figures have been provided.</p>

<p>Stokes says having a recording of the exchange of gunfire that killed 30-year-old Elliot Reed could increase public trust.</p>

<p>READ MORE: Police identify suspect killed in officer involved shooting</p>

<p>There have been four officer involved shootings in Jackson since January.</p>

<p>"To make sure that citizens feel that the evidence will be there if something happens and will protect not only the citizens, but it will protect law enforcement also," said Stokes. "Again, you want to keep a good marriage between the citizens of this city and law enforcement."</p>

<p>Tuesday, the Jackson City Council voted 6-1 to enter a memorandum of understanding between the city and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation for the investigation of officer involved shooting incidents and in-custody deaths.</p>

<p>Less than 24 hours later, MBI is conducting its first JPD officer involved shooting investigation in recent history.</p>

<p>Although he supports the police department not investigating themselves, Stokes was the lone vote against the plan.</p>

<p>The Ward 3 representative prefers an independent investigator or organization like NOBLE, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement or Jackson State University's criminal justice professor Dr. Jimmy Bell to conduct the officer involved shooting investigations.</p>

<p>The Yazoo City Police Department is the latest Mississippi law enforcement agency to incorporate high tech equipment.</p>

<p>Officers now wearing the Pileum body cameras, which can record their movements on patrol.</p>

<p>Chief Ron Sampson said, "If we have a major incident it will record the incident itself. We can go back and look at it. Another thing is you have a complaint someone says an officer was acting improper being true or not we have that footage to go back and look at."</p>

<p>Integrated with cameras in the squad cars, the officers are also tracked with GPS. Whenever they open their door to do a traffic stop, the cameras come on, recording their interaction with citizens.</p>

<p>Sampson said,"If you fire your weapon the camera will automatically activate so if an officer is in a situation and has to use his weapon and isn't able to call out for help the unit will activate the camera and sent out an alert."</p>

<p>The camera system cost the city $77,000. The video is stored in the cloud where it can be accessed, viewed and downloaded later. A digital tool that city leaders say will make officers more accountable.</p>

<p>"Good bad or ugly we just have to face the truth sometimes things happen that we have to have an accurate account for be it for the officer be it for the citizen, this is the way to do it," said Chief Sampson.</p>

<p>JACKSON, MS (Mississippi News Now) -</p>

<p>The Mississippi ACLU is pushing for statewide guidelines for law enforcement body cameras.</p>

<p>The organization sent Public Records Act requests to 147 local agencies to collect existing policies for review.</p>

<p>They received 65 local policies from sheriff's and police departments in response.</p>

<p>The organization hopes a bill, to be introduced in the House and Senate setting standardized policy, will gain a foothold in the legislative session.</p>

<p>They maintain there are key gaps between policy and principle.</p>

<p>As an example, the ACLU says zero policies require that law enforcement officers notify individuals that they are being recorded.</p>

<p>Less than 20 percent of policies require officers deactivate the cameras if a resident requested deactivation as a condition of consenting to the officer's entry into a residence.</p>

<p>And none of the 65 policies give apparent victims of domestic violence the authority to require deactivation during the interview.</p>

<p>"What we are calling upon is there be a balance between access to the public and law enforcement accountability so that the use of body cams can be a win-win for not only for the police department, but for citizens as well," said ACLU Mississippi Executive Director Jennifer Riley Collins.</p>

<p>The ACLU says body cams are an effective tool of policing, but only if laws are passed that balance police protection, privacy and transparency.</p>

<h2 id="theirpreferreddallasdacandidatelostbutreformerssaytheyrestillwinning">Their preferred Dallas DA candidate lost, but reformers say they're still winning</h2>

<p>by: Jon Schuppe /</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-06</p>

<p>url: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/their-preferred-dallas-da-candidate-lost-reformers-say-they-re-n854521 </p>

<p>As a recount unfolded Wednesday to determine who would move on to the general election, reformers said Dallas remains crucial to their goal of reshaping America’s criminal justice system from the bottom up.</p>

<p>Also on the list of possible targets this year are Baltimore; Charlotte, North Carolina; Los Angeles; Oakland, California; San Diego and St. Louis.</p>

<p>Related: Criminal justice reformers aim big by targeting local DA races</p>

<p>The reformers said their efforts hinged less on electing particular people and more on pushing candidates to adopt policies that would be fairer to poor people and minorities and send fewer people to jail.</p>

<p>That includes reducing reliance on cash bail, expanding jail-diversion programs, building conviction-integrity units and seeking fewer death penalty cases.</p>

<p>“Our work doesn’t stop. That’s an emphatic point,” said Brianna Brown, deputy director of the Texas Organizing Project, one of several local, state and national groups that pressed Dallas candidates to adopt reform-minded agendas and urged voters to consider those commitments.</p>

<p>Her organization endorsed Elizabeth Frizell, a former judge who pledged to end the use of cash bail and arrests for low-level marijuana possession in Dallas. Frizell lost by a few hundred votes to John Creuzot, also a former judge and who also embraced much of the reformers’ agenda. Unless the recount turns the results around, Creuzot will face Republican Faith Johnson, who was appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott after her predecessor resigned.</p>

<p>Reformers’ involvement in the race pushed both candidates to embrace a more progressive policy agenda that put Dallas at the top of a national conversation about criminal justice reform — efforts that will continue in the general election, Brown said.</p>

<p>“The fight for criminal justice reform doesn’t end with one election," Brown said. "The stakes are too high."</p>

<p>Reformers also claimed victory in the Democratic district attorney primary in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio, where incumbent Nico LaHood reportedly lost to defense lawyer Joe Gonzales.</p>

<p>Dallas drew national attention because Texas held the earliest 2018 primaries, giving reformers a chance to reassert themselves as a force in this year’s election season.</p>

<p>Last year, a coalition of national and local groups helped engineer civil rights lawyer Larry Krasner’s upset victory in Philadelphia’s district attorney race.</p>

<p>In that election, the reformers, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, targeted pivotal voter blocs with digital advertising, public forums and formerly incarcerated men and women who canvassed neighborhoods, asking voters to support candidates who agreed to reduce mass incarceration. Liberal billionaire George Soros — who has helped fund the ACLU’s efforts and has been donating to progressive district attorney candidates around the country — also gave money to Krasner.</p>

<p>Krasner’s win followed victories in prior years by progressive candidates in New York; Chicago; Denver; Houston; Orlando, Florida; and smaller jurisdictions in Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas.</p>

<p>The movement has been driven by a growing acknowledgment of the power held by local prosecutors, and their role in a three-decade rise in prison populations that peaked in 2009, long after crime began to decline. Despite their influence over who gets prosecuted and what sentences they receive, few prosecutors face serious campaign challenges, researchers say.</p>

<p>In January, the reformers took their Philadelphia playbook to Dallas, a Democrat-majority city with a history of racial segregation, racially disparate marijuana arrests, high rates of death penalty cases and allegations of running a cash bail system that discriminates against the poor.</p>

<p>While Soros does not appear to have donated money to any of the Dallas candidates, other similar-minded groups did. The newly formed Real Justice PAC and the Texas Organizing Project both contributed several thousand dollars to Frizell.</p>

<p>And the ACLU’s national and Texas offices invested heavily in the Dallas primary, although they did not endorse a candidate. They focused instead on pressing the candidates to take positions on a number of policies important to reformers.</p>

<p>Color of Change PAC, whose political action committee endorsed Frizell, and Real Justice PAC, another national organization, also made a big push online and on the campaign trail. The Texas Organizing Project conducted its own canvassing effort.</p>

<p>“In order to make a real dent in mass incarceration, we have to have better decision makers and better leaders in big jurisdictions, not just because district attorneys have power over a large number of people’s lives, but also so they can set a standard for what should be done and what’s possible,” Color of Change PAC spokesman Rashad Robinson said.</p>

<p>Sharon Watkins Jones, director of political strategies for the ACLU of Texas, said she noticed candidates changing their stump speeches to include pledges to reduce mass incarceration.</p>

<p>“We’d like to think that’s result of us asking those types of questions,” she said Wednesday.</p>

<p>CORRECTION (March 8, 2018, 10:17 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the name of a political action committee. It is the Color of Change PAC, not the Color of Justice PAC.</p>

<h2 id="criminaljusticereformersaimbigbytargetinglocaldaraces">Criminal justice reformers aim big by targeting local DA races</h2>

<p>by: Jon Schuppe /</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-13</p>

<p>url: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/criminal-justice-reformers-aim-big-targeting-local-da-races-n847436 </p>

<p>DALLAS — If you can’t win big, go small.</p>

<p>That’s the strategy gaining momentum among criminal justice reformers in the age of Trump, as the federal government hardens its approach to law enforcement.</p>

<p>Instead of pouring money and energy into squeezing change out of Washington, national civil rights organizations are teaming with local groups to push their agendas in county-level district attorney races, where a few thousand votes can determine who asserts the most influence over the local justice system.</p>

<p>Picking their targets carefully, and crunching election data to influence pivotal voter blocs — and benefiting from the largesse of liberal billionaire George Soros — these crusaders have already racked up big wins, most recently in Philadelphia, where civil rights lawyer Larry Krasner was elected chief prosecutor last year.</p>

<p>Using Krasner as proof that their strategy can work, the American Civil Liberties Union, Color of Change and like-minded political action committees are now fixating on several 2018 races, with Dallas at the front of a list that could also include Baltimore; Charlotte, North Carolina; Los Angeles; Oakland, California; San Diego and St. Louis, as well as parts of Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Oregon.</p>

<p>Each will involve teams of campaign strategists and targeted voter-education drives, from public forums to digital advertising, and the hiring of formerly incarcerated men and women to canvass neighborhoods, asking voters to demand that candidates pledge to curb mass incarceration — and to cast ballots for those who agree. In some cases, political action committees will steer donations to campaigns that embrace their vision. In others, reformers are recruiting upstart candidates.</p>

<p>“We want to send a clear message that these are the real issues and the litmus test in the election, and to demonstrate the public demand for it,” said Scott Roberts, a senior campaign director at Color of Change, which organizes online campaigns focused on ending injustices against African-Americans.</p>

<p>“We can put out a press release, but the candidates, the people who are trying to get votes, will respond on a deeper level when they’re hearing about it from people as they are out campaigning.”</p>

<p>The wave begins</p>

<p>This is a new development in American politics, where district attorney races have rarely attracted outside attention, let alone intense interest from voters. Incumbents usually run unopposed, research has found. And when they do face opposition, they usually win, with races focused on the candidates’ character and experience, or controversial cases, rather than discussions of policy.</p>

<p>“That conventional wisdom has been turned on its head,” said David Alan Sklansky, a professor at Stanford Law School who studies prosecutors and how they wield power. “In a growing number of races, people have defeated incumbents by running on platforms that are very policy heavy. They’re not calling for more punishment, but more sensible policies,” from police oversight to criminal sentencing.</p>

<p>The trend began about five years ago, when Ken Thompson defeated longtime Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes. Since that 2013 election, self-described reform candidates have taken office in Chicago, Denver, Houston, and Orlando, Florida, and in smaller jurisdictions in Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and Texas. Many were lifted into office by outcries over police shootings, wrongful convictions or the disproportionate numbers of poor people and minorities behind bars.</p>

<p>The movement has been supported by new research into the causes of the three-decade rise in prison populations, which peaked in 2009, long after crime began to decline. In his 2017 book, "Locked In," Fordham University law professor John Pfaff blamed prosecutors, “the most powerful actors in the criminal justice system,” for driving drastic increases in felony cases, all but a tiny fraction of which result in plea bargains. Those locally elected prosecutors, Pfaff wrote, are rarely held accountable by voters for their decisions.</p>

<p>But Pfaff also documented how reform candidates have started to challenge that narrative.</p>

<p>Some have received donations from political action committees connected to Soros, who heads the Open Society Foundation. Some have received tactical help from national reform groups like the ACLU and Color of Change. But others haven’t, which Sklansky takes as evidence that the movement has been driven from the bottom as much as from the top.</p>

<p>Sharing stories</p>

<p>At the bottom, there are people like William Roundtree.</p>

<p>Short, muscular and heavily tattooed, the 40-year-old Dallas native stumbled into the cause after his Jan. 29 release from state prison, the end of a nearly 14-year stretch for stealing tools from a utility truck to feed his drug habit.</p>

<p>On his second day of freedom, he encountered two people passing out petitions at a rail station. He told them his story: drug addiction, petty crimes, three short prison terms, and then the theft that earned him a "repeat and habitual” offender sentencing enhancement. He says he got clean on his own without being offered treatment.</p>

<p>The petitioners, working for the ACLU, steered him to their headquarters, where he was hired as a $12-an-hour canvasser. Now he walks neighborhoods near the one where he did his crimes, introducing himself to homeowners and telling them of the importance of voting for a district attorney who “seeks justice rather than convictions.”</p>

<p>Occasionally, someone questions whether he really knows what it’s like to be pulled through the machinery that turns men into prisoners. Trying to be respectful, Roundtree says he knows better than most.</p>

<p>“I’m not saying I shouldn’t have been punished, but maybe there could have been other options,” he says. “Maybe there could have been a diversion program. Something more helpful than throwing me away for a decade and a half, almost.”</p>

<p>When people seem skeptical about voting, he gently tries to persuade them. “We’re at a turning point in Dallas,” he says.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia experiment</p>

<p>Roundtree's work is modeled after the ACLU-led campaign that lifted Krasner to office in Philadelphia last year.</p>

<p>The ACLU worked with Color of Change and local groups on granular aspects of the race, holding candidate forums, building social media campaigns and deploying a battalion of ex-offenders to encourage people to get to the polls. The ACLU spent $150,000, mostly on canvassers. A Soros-linked political action committee gave Krasner nearly $1.5 million.</p>

<p>This all happened during the Democratic primary, which is more important than the general election in Philadelphia since Democrats far outnumber Republicans. Udi Ofer, director of the ACLU’s Campaign for Smart Justice, said the organization analyzed election data, estimated how many votes were needed to win the race — about 25,000, it figured — and set out to make sure that its 11,000 members who lived in the city and were registered to vote showed up on Election Day.</p>

<p>Because the ACLU is nonprofit and cannot endorse candidates, it instead pushed a reform agenda. But Krasner was clearly the best match. In the end, Krasner needed more than 25,000 votes to win, and did by a large margin.</p>

<p>“What we did in Philadelphia is make the case that if we’re going to truly transform the criminal justice system and end mass incarceration, we need to hold prosecutors accountable,” said Ofer.</p>

<p>A new fight</p>

<p>Citing Philadelphia as a model, the reformers converged last month in Dallas, a blue city in a deep-red state with a history of racial segregation, racially disparate marijuana arrests and probation revocations, and high rates of death-penalty cases and wrongful convictions. The city has also come under attack for a cash bail system that packs the local jail with people awaiting trial.</p>

<p>Two former judges, John Creuzot and Elizabeth Frizell, are running in the March 6 primary, hoping to take on Republican Faith Johnson, who was appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott after her predecessor resigned in 2016.</p>

<p>The approach in Dallas County is different from Philadelphia in that the reformers — including the ACLU, Color of Change, the Texas Organizing Project and Faith in Texas — are focusing not only on rallying their card-carrying members but also registered voters in parts of the city with large minority populations, where people are more likely to have interactions with the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>ACLU analysts said they determined that it would take about 27,000 votes to win the Democratic primary, and that the reformers would need to “influence” about 14,000 people to make a difference. With about 8,000 ACLU members in the central and northern parts of the county forming dependable bases of support, the organization began looking for places in historically black south Dallas where its message would be received favorably.</p>

<p>No reform-minded political action committees have donated to candidates, at least not yet, according to campaign finance documents. The ACLU expects to spend about $300,000 on its efforts, double the Philadelphia budget; the Dallas operation will include a larger arsenal of tactics, including bird-dogging candidates.</p>

<p>"The stakes are high because this sets the tone and direction for what this criminal justice system will look like in this county,” said Sara Mokuria, co-founder of Mothers Against Police Brutality, a Dallas-based partner in the reform campaign.</p>

<p>The campaign formally began on Saturday with an ACLU-sponsored candidates’ forum at Paul Quinn College, a historically black institution in south Dallas. The moderator was Anthony Graves, who spent more than a decade on death row for murders he didn’t commit, in part because of prosecutor misconduct.</p>

<p>Many of those who asked questions were recovering addicts and ex-offenders or had family members behind bars. They pressed the Democratic candidates — Johnson declined the ACLU’s invitation — to support eliminating bail, leniency for low-level drug offenses, treatment for addicts, easing up on property seizures and avoiding the death penalty.</p>

<p>The point was to not only push the campaign into a discussion on reform, but also create a record to hold the winner accountable to.</p>

<p>“If we’re going to bring about lasting change, real change, in our criminal justice system, it will start with the people in this room,” said Sharon Watkins Jones, director of political strategies for the ACLU of Texas.</p>

<p>Knocking on doors</p>

<p>After the forum, a group of ex-offenders spread across south Dallas, armed with smartphones equipped with an app that showed them the houses and names of registered voters in targeted neighborhoods. Separate groups of petitioners handed out literature at public gathering places.</p>

<p>Roundtree, still marveling at the wonders of his device, wore an ACLU Texas T-shirt, his neatly trimmed hair and beard barely obscuring the tattoos that covered his face and scalp.</p>

<p>He headed into a housing development in Oak Cliff, not far from where he was now living with his sister and her family.</p>

<p>A cold front had moved into the city, bringing temperatures below freezing — and making it difficult to hold doorstep conversations with strangers. Where they refused, he left literature. To those who answered, he told them quickly about the election and the power of district attorneys to decide who gets charged with crimes, and influence what kind of punishment they receive.</p>

<p>“We want to eliminate racial bias,” he told them. “We want to hold police and prosecutors accountable.”</p>

<p>Few bothered to stop to talk. Too cold. But Roundtree, shivering, kept moving, hoping to find people willing to listen to his story.</p>

<p>Carceral feminism sees law enforcement as the primary solution to gender-based violence. When the United States passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, it was seen as a landmark bill to finally address domestic violence. The bill provided billions of dollars to fund more police officers and prisons, and introduced punitive sentencing to curb domestic violence.</p>

<p>More than two decades later, it has left many women in less affluent and marginalized communities even more vulnerable to violence. Since many communities of color are already overpoliced, victims are often reluctant to call the police for fear of being met with trauma and criminalization.</p>

<p>The Open Society Foundations have a history of supporting transformative systems of justice. Transformative justice is a community-based process where individuals are able to address and repair the harm on their own terms, and to define what justice looks like to them. In many ways, the #MeToo movement is beginning to address the wrongs of carceral feminism through a more democratized process of addressing injustice. Join us during the week of International Women’s Day for a discussion with activists and authors to identify potential opportunities and pitfalls in the search for justice for victims in a #MeToo era.</p>

<p>Batyr Berdyev is a victim of enforced disappearances in Turkmenistan. A former diplomat and then Minister of Foreign Affairs, he was arrested along with dozens of other high-ranking officials in 2002 for allegedly participating in an attempted coup d’état. Berdyev was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Since his arrest in 2002, his family has not seen him, and do not know where is he is or if he is alive at all.</p>

<p>International human rights organizations, lawyers, and doctors are denied access to him, and he cannot receive packages or letters. There has been no official information about Berdyev’s status since 2002, and his voice was last heard by a fellow prison inmate in May or June 2005. According to witnesses, Berdyev was severely beaten and tortured during his arrest and interrogation.</p>

<p>The Open Society Foundations, in collaboration with Crude Accountability and the Prove They Are Alive! campaign, host a conversation about the art and advocacy of Berdyev’s Parting Song: Poems from Prison. Panelists will examine the role of art and the artist in oppressive regimes, particularly as vehicles for contemporary advocacy.

<h2 id="insidemississippisnotoriousparchmanprison">Inside Mississippi’s notorious Parchman prison</h2>

<p>by: Hannah Grabenstein</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-29</p>

<p>url: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/inside-mississippis-notorious-parchman-prison </p>

<p>Located about 100 miles south of Memphis in the Mississippi River Delta, the birthplace of the blues, Mississippi State Prison in Parchman, Mississippi, has become as much a historical landmark as it is a penitentiary. It’s about 30 miles from where Emmett Till was murdered in 1955, and surrounded by uninhabitable swampland.</p>

<p>Parchman’s storied history is the basis for the prison farms featured in the movies “Cool Hand Luke” and “O Brother Where Art Thou?”, it’s referred to as “destination doom” in a William Faulkner’s novel “The Mansion,” and it is now a haunted setting in Jesmyn Ward’s National Book Award-winning 2017 novel “Sing, Unburied, Sing.”</p>

<p>Growing up on Mississippi’s southern coast, Ward said that Parchman loomed over her childhood. “When I thought about prison, that’s the prison that came to mind,” she said. “I didn’t know much about it, but I knew it was a place I never wanted to end up. And the danger that I would end up there was a real thing, for me and for people that I know and loved.”</p>

<p>Ward writes about two generations of prisoners at Parchman, including two young black inmates in the early part of the century and a white inmate, Michael, who’s just been released. “Pop,” a father and grandfather, and the ghost of a boy named “Richie” both remember a harsh, painful prison farm of the past. In the present-day of the novel, Michael’s character and Richie’s ghost says little has changed.</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think it done changed. And then I sleep and wake up, and it ain’t changed none,” Richie tells the young narrator, JoJo. “It’s like a snake that sheds its skin. The outside look different when the scales change, but the inside always the same.”</p>

<p>The Pride of Mississippi</p>

<p>The history of Mississippi State Penitentiary is a history of failed reforms. Its creation in 1901 was borne of a statewide shame and frustration at the contemporary system of convict leasing, writes David Oshinsky, historian and author of “Worse Than Slavery: Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow Justice.”</p>

<p>In the Reconstructionist south, states’ coffers were empty, prisons destroyed, and their former free labor supply was emancipated. Many southern states, including Mississippi, began arresting almost exclusively young, black men on charges ranging from laundering to larceny to murder. Some were legitimate, but many more were fabricated or embellished. The state began leasing the prisoners to wealthy contractors, who would further sublease them to companies.</p>

<p>“The convicts, under convict leasing, would do the kind of work that free labor would not want to do. In other words, the work a white worker might not want to do,” Oshinsky said.</p>

<p>Under convict leasing, the inmates were essentially slaves again, Oshinsky said. They worked long hours for no pay, were poorly fed, and slept in tents at work sites doing dangerous jobs like dynamiting tunnels for railroad companies and clearing malarial-filled swamps for construction. Convicts, sometimes including children under age 10, were whipped and beaten, underfed, and rarely given medical treatment. Oshinksy writes that between 9 and 16 percent of convicts died yearly in the 1880s.</p>

<p>But poor whites began to resent the system that drove wages down for free workers. In 1904, Mississippi elected a new governor – James Kimble Vardaman – who aimed to reform the system, in part to benefit the lower-class whites. Parchman’s first year of operation was in 1905. It was massive, remote, and modeled after a traditional southern plantation.</p>

<p>Parchman was originally comprised of three separate farms: a small farm, which was maintained by white convicts, a smaller one farmed by women (mostly black), and a huge sprawling plantation for the prison’s black convicts. Over 20,000 acres and 46 miles, it was intended to be self-sufficient and profitable for the state, and it was.</p>

<p>Convicts, called gunmen, picked cotton under the watch of the most violent offenders, who were given guns and called trusty-shooters, or trusties, Oshinsky said. Hogjaw and Kinnie, the trusties Ward writes about in “Sing, Unburied, Sing,” were also real men; in 1947 Hogjaw was pardoned for killing an escaping convict. The farm was profitable; in 1918, Oshinsky wrote that the prison had a net revenue of $825,000, or about $800 per inmate.</p>

<p>In 1911, The New York Times ran a sprawling spread in the Sunday edition which heaped praise on the prison.</p>

<p>“The pride of Mississippi, however, is the ‘Parchman Place,’” the article read. “Actually instances have been known of when negroes were turned out of the penitentiary, given a new suit and $10 in money, they would not want to leave and would inquire if there was not some way by which they could stay there.”</p>

<p>But the reality, says Oshinksy, is that Parchman was nearly uninhabitable. Convicts worked six days a week, lived in barracks with no separation or classification by crime, and were often subject to punishment by a whip referred to as “Black Annie.”</p>

<p>Destination Doom</p>

<p>Parchman Farm stayed this way, more or less, for the next 70 years. Cotton picking became mechanized and the state instituted some small reforms. A relatively impotent parole board deferred to the superintendent, Oshinksy writes, and small vocational and educational programs excluded black prisoners. A maximum security unit with a guard tower, fences, and gates housed individual cells, a gas chamber for executions, and a solitary confinement wing.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Parchman remained frozen in time, a segregated, harsh prison farm. It was during this period that it housed some of its most famous prisoners: Elvis Presley’s father Vernon was imprisoned in 1938 for “check forgery,” and blues singers Bukka White and Son House for dubious claims of violence. After his release, White composed his famous “Parchman Farm Blues,” which warned young men about the horror of the prison.</p>

<p>Some of the Freedom Riders, a group of interracial young civil rights activists who boycotted Jim Crow laws, served time at Parchman, although they were segregated from the general population. Claude Liggins, 77, said the racism by the guards at Parchman was mostly directed at the white Freedom Riders. “They couldn’t understand why they would want to go against their own race and support us,” Liggins, who is black, said. “They had several white men who were beaten almost to death.”</p>

<p>In 1971, a civil rights lawyer named Roy Haber visited a convict at Parchman who was challenging his conviction. While there, Haber heard accounts from other inmates and personally witnessed the conditions, which he described as the last legal vestiges of slavery.</p>

<p>Almost a century earlier, the 13th amendment had abolished slavery in all cases except in penal servitude. “You can make somebody work if they’re a prisoner. Using that distinction, they were able to maintain a slave state within the prison,” Haber said.</p>

<p>Haber represented the inmates in a class action lawsuit against the prison in the now landmark case of Gates v. Collier. In 1971, the judge ruled in favor of the inmates, and throughout the next decade, he forced the prison to desegregate, eliminate “Black Annie” and other unconstitutional forms of punishment, and end the forced field labor.</p>

<p>The state began to build facilities with real cells and walls, ended the trusty system, and hired professional, often black, guards and administrative staff. At last, it seemed like the prison might function as a rehabilitative facility instead of a slave plantation.</p>

<p>Problems persist</p>

<p>Fast forward closer to the present, and reform has not come easily to Mississippi State Penitentiary. Since Gates v. Collier, a number of lawsuits have brought attention and middling reforms to the prison, which is now about 67 percent black. according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections Monthly Fact Sheet. In 1999, Margaret Winter, at the time associate director of the National Prison Project at the ACLU, represented HIV positive inmates who were not receiving necessary antiviral HIV combination therapy. They alleged that they were segregated from the general population, were barred from holding jobs, and lived in squalor. They were re-integrated in 2001, and the ACLU later reported that conditions for them improved.</p>

<p>In 2002 and 2003, Winter and the ACLU pursued a series of cases on behalf of the death row inmates in the supermax unit, Unit 32. They alleged the conditions were inhumane and that the temperature reached 130 degrees Fahrenheit in some cells. Inmates described to the ACLU intense stench from sewage backups, extreme isolation, and lack of personal hygiene.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a years-long reevaluation of the classification system revealed that approximately 80 percent of the inmates who were determined “high risk” offenders and who were segregated from the general population in the hole were misclassified. Over four years, some 800 previously high-risk prisoners, who had wrongly been in supermax based on the violence of their crime rather than their behavior in prison, were reintegrated back into general population. Educational and rehabilitative programs were instituted. For the first time, the prison had mental health services.</p>

<p>At the time, Christopher Epps, commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, was leading the charge. He’d battled the ACLU through the various lawsuits and ultimately elected to spearhead the changes to the penal system. Before Unit 32 was shuttered, Epps instituted various education and life skills programs, and allowed exercise and made efforts to reduce solitary confinement at Parchman.</p>

<p>But in 2014, Epps was indicted on federal charges of bribery and kickbacks. In 2016, Epps was sentenced to just under 20 years in prison. In an ironic twist, he was held in solitary confinement in a Tennessee correctional facility.</p>

<p>In today’s Parchman, prisoners complain of leaky roofs, broken windows and easy access to contraband. Anthony Sims, a prisoner at Parchman since 1988, when he was convicted of manslaughter, aggravated assault and burglary, says he knows of at least four men who died in his prison unit last year, all from overdoses of smuggled drugs. Five prisoners that the NewsHour spoke with, along with attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center, say there are few educational or rehabilitative programs.</p>

<p>The prison disputes this. Grace Fisher, communications director for the Mississippi Department of Corrections, said in an email that the agency has an onsite maintenance department that addresses infrastructure problems when presented. She also said the prison has “zero tolerance for any person – staff, inmate, visitor or vendor – who is instrumental in introducing contraband and that “all inmates have access to programs, based on classification status.”</p>

<p>In “Sing, Unburied, Sing,” Parchman’s historical presence was crucial to Ward. “Because that place casts such a large shadow in Mississippi and in my family, in my community I really wanted to write about it,” she said.</p>

<p>And she wanted to tell the prisoners’ stories.</p>

<p>“I realized that people just didn’t know that there was so much human suffering tied to that place,” Ward said. “I wanted it to seem real to people, and I wanted them to know so that the people who suffered in that place, and the people who live with the legacy of that place today, are not forgotten.”</p>

<p>File photo - Pride event (Photo by JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)</p>

<p>A city in Mississippi is facing a lawsuit – after banning an LGBT Pride event.</p>

<p>Local politicians in Starkville, Mississippi – which has a population of 25,000 – had voted to deny an application from a local LGBT group to hold a Pride event in the city.</p>

<p>Just two locals had objected to plans for the parade, which was set to take place on March 24, but the conservative-controlled Board of Aldermen swiftly passed a motion to block the plans.</p>

<p>Four Aldermen – Roy A. Perkins, Ben Carver, David Little and Henry Vaughn voted down the proposals, while, three – Sandra Sistrunk, Jason Walker and Patrick Miller – voted to support the parade.</p>

<p>The decision to block the event from going ahead has led to condemnation from civil rights groups – as well as legal action.</p>

<p>Strangely, Republicans who often defend the ‘free speech’ of people to discriminate against gay couples have been entirely silent on the row.</p>

<p>But attorney Roberta Kaplan, a seasoned defender of LGBT rights who previously took an equal marriage fight to the Supreme Court, has confirmed she is representing Starkville Pride and the group’s organiser Bailey McDaniel.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Starkville Daily News, Kaplan said: “It’s pretty clear to us that what the town did here was a blatant and overt violation of the First Amendment.</p>

<p>“You can’t deny people the right to speak publicly based on the contents of their speech.</p>

<p>“We intend to be very prompt. We absolutely are going to do something to get this overturned.”</p>

<p>ACLU of Mississippi Executive Director Jennifer Riley-Collins added: “The ACLU of Mississippi calls upon the city of Starkville to act swiftly in approving a request from a grassroots group planning to host the city’s first Pride Parade on March 24.</p>

<p>“The Starkville Board of Aldermen’s recent denial of the request potentially violates the First Amendment and Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>“The government cannot prevent a parade or event simply because it promotes LGBTQ pride or because its organizers and marchers are LGBTQ. In addition, the government cannot treat people unequally because they are LGBTQ.</p>

<p>“This is exactly what the Board of Alderman did, and that is discrimination, plain and simple. It also violates the Constitution.</p>

<p>“It is disappointing and disturbing that the Starkville Board of Alderman would decide to treat LGBTQ people differently from everyone else. The ACLU of Mississippi, therefore, urges the Starkville Board of Alderman to reconsider their decision and approve the request.”</p>

<p>Mississippi is one of seven states that continues to prohibit teachers in publicly-funded schools from discussing LGBT issues in the classroom</p>

<p>So-called ‘no promo homo’ laws are on the statute books in Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas.</p>

<p>Former police officer Michael Slager was sentenced to twenty years in prison Thursday for the second-degree murder of Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina in 2015. A video of the incident taken by a bystander clearly showed the white officer shooting Scott, who was black, as he ran away. The video went viral and was instrumental in leading to Slager’s arrest.</p>

<p>BREAKING: Former cop Michael Slager sentenced to 20 years in prison for fatally shooting Walter Scott, an unarmed black man, in 2015. https://t.co/18T8LHPgzC</p>

<p>If it wasn’t for that video, there would have likely never been an arrest.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t for that video, Michael Slager would be working today said Rodney Scott- brother of slain Walter Scott#chs</p>

<p>— Bill Sharpe (@BillSharpelive5) December 7, 2017</p>

<p>“If the video had not emerged in the Walter Scott case, this is most certainly where the story would have ended,” I wrote in the aftermath of the killing in 2015. “Just another black man dead at the hands of police and a general public that largely would either be ignorant of the incident or if they were aware, would assume Walter Scott probably did something wrong.”</p>

<p>Slager reportedly told Scott’s mother that he was “sorry” in the courtroom during his sentencing on Thursday. Scott’s mother forgave him.</p>

<p>I think 20 years for Slager is not enough given the gravity of his crime. Some might disagree.</p>

<p>But no one should disagree that it is cruel and unjust that thousands of people are serving life sentences for committing far less due to mandatory minimum sentencing.</p>

<p>Let’s just focus on non-violent criminals.</p>

<p>A 2013 ACLU study on the subject noted, “For 3,278 people, it was nonviolent offenses like stealing a $159 jacket or serving as a middleman in the sale of $10 of marijuana.” The report also observed, “An estimated 65% of them are Black.”</p>

<p>“Many of them were struggling with mental illness, drug dependency or financial desperation when they committed their crimes,” the ACLU said. “None of them will ever come home to their parents and children. And taxpayers are spending billions to keep them behind bars.”</p>

<p>Some of the crimes of those in this category also include stealing tools from a shed, carrying drugs for an abusive boyfriend, taking a wallet from a hotel room, and stealing a truck.</p>

<p>Though this comprehensive ACLU study was published in 2013, you do not have to search far to find newer, similar tragic tales, like this woman convicted just last month for having $20 worth of cocaine, who is now serving life without parole in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Again, those incarcerated are also disproportionately minorities.</p>

<p>It is not known at the moment when convicted murderer Michael Slager might be eligible for parole. But it is known to thousands in the U.S. convicted of non-violent crimes—painfully, every day—that they will never again be free.</p>

<p>If you are in South Carolina and your pants dip too far below your waistline, you may soon be guilty of more than just a fashion crime.</p>

<p>In an unusual show of bipartisan agreement, two Midland Democrats and one Republican have sponsored proposed baggy pants ban House Bill 4957, with five Democrats and two Republicans co-sponsoring. As local news affiliate WTLX observed this week, "Violation fines equal just enough to buy that much needed belt" — "$25 for a first offense; $50 or three hours of community service for a second offense; and $75 or six hours of community service for a third or subsequent offense."</p>

<p>The suggested new stipulations are mathematically precise. It would be unlawful for a person to wear pants "more than three inches below the crest of his ileum exposing his skin or undergarments." For those who are new to the word "ileum," it's the third part of the small intestine. So just figure out where your intestine ends and try to keep your jeans above that area, and you shouldn't have to do any community service.</p>

<p>There's already precedent for the proposal in South Carolina — two years ago the town of Timmonsville issued an ordinance against engaging in public nudity, displaying pornography or "the flesh of one's rear-end" and wearing saggy pants.</p>

<p>Other states, including Louisiana and Mississippi, have attempted similar moves with varying degrees of success. In 2014, an Ocala, Florida pants ban was repealed after accusations of racial profiling. Yet one local schoolteacher at the time lamented, "It’s deplorable; it’s despicable; nobody wants to see anyone’s behind." Back in 2007, as debates over sagging laws happened in many communities, the ACLU of Georgia told the New York Times, "I don’t see any way that something constitutional could be crafted when the intention is to single out and label one style of dress that originated with the black youth culture, as an unacceptable form of expression.”</p>

<p>It's more often women's bodies that are scrutinized and regulated than men's, but attire being strictly controlled seems an insane and unenforceable notion for anybody. If, however, any ambitious lawmaker has some ideas on how regulate ironic trucker hats or romphims for the greater public good, what sartorially minded citizen would want to stand in its way?</p>

<p>TUPELO, Miss. (AP) — A push for greater diversity in a Mississippi city’s police advisory board has yielded the board’s second black member.</p>

<p>Bridgette Wilson was nominated by Tupelo Mayor Jason Shelton and approved by the City Council Tuesday night. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports Wilson is also the board’s second female member.</p>

<p>The advisory board was formed nearly a year ago and has been criticized for its nearly all-white composition. The push by the mayor’s office to expand the advisory board from nine to 11 members aims to address the lack of diversity. The mayor still has to nominate an 11th member.</p>

<p>Wilson is a corporate risk manager for North Mississippi Health Services. She is also going through a three-month citizens police academy by the city’s police department.</p>

<p>• KAUZ Channel 6 reported that 48 individuals held in solitary confinement at the James Allred Unit in Iowa Park, Texas, have begun refusing meals in a hunger strike against conditions at the prison. According to the wife of an individual held at Allred, the hunger strikers “feel their rights are being violated.”</p>

<p>• Five immigrants held at Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, California, have filed a federal civil lawsuit against the contracted private prison company CoreCivic, alleging the facility forces individuals to work for at most $1.50 per day, in violation of human trafficking laws and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention standards. According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, the complaint alleges that staff threatens people who do not work with solitary confinement and deprivation of visitation rights. The immigrants named in the complaint are all asylum seekers and have pending cases.</p>

<p>• The Record Journal reported that a new law passed last year, effective January 1, will prohibit Connecticut’s Department of Corrections from using solitary confinement for individuals under the age of 18. The law will also require the DOC commissioner to review the use of solitary confinement; mandate annual reports on the use of “restrictive housing” and “administrative segregation”; and provide additional training and “promote wellness” for correctional staff. The Executive Director of the ACLU of Connecticut said the bill “takes an important step toward justice.”</p>

<p>• According to In Justice Today, King County (Seattle), Washington, has passed a bill prohibiting solitary confinement for youth held in adult correctional facilities, 86 percent of whom were black in 2016 and many of whom are pretrial detainees. Solitary confinement has already been eliminated from King County’s juvenile detention center. One of the bill’s cosponsors, Jeanne Kohl-Welles, said, “It is my hope that this legislation marks a significant shift in the way we think about and administer justice, especially for minors, at King County. It is our responsibility to make sure all young people in detention have the access and opportunity they need to reach their full potential.”</p>

<p>• Honolulu Civil Beat discussed the mental health effects of solitary confinement, in anticipation of the House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) 85 Task Force, which will release an evaluation report on Hawaii’s prison system next week. The article linked solitary confinement with mental health symptoms, such as “suicidality, self-harm, paranoia, panic attacks, hallucination and social atrophy.” It highlighted the story of 30-year-old Jessica Forston, who had a history of seizures and mental illness before committing suicide in her solitary confinement cell at the Women’s Community Correctional Center in Kailua last summer. The HCR Task Force faces pressure to privatize the state prison on Oahu, though it previously expressed interest in transforming state correctional facilities to utilize a more rehabilitative approach.</p>

<p>• ProPublica published the story of Tyler Haire, a boy with a list of severe mental illnesses who ended up in Calhoun County Jail in Mississippi at the age of 16 after stabbing his father’s girlfriend. Haire waited in jail for three and a half years for his mental evaluation from the understaffed and underfunded state mental hospital. Spending much of his time in solitary confinement, allegedly for his own protection, Haire would throw tantrums or talk about his visions of aliens and the voices he heard in his head. Though the county sheriff said that his need for mental health treatment was “evident to anyone,” Haire was deemed competent to stand trial, pled guilty, and received seven years in the state prison. The senior judge in Calhoun County said he’s haunted by cases like Tyler’s. “Of course, I worry that this is what I’m participating in – the warehousing of the mentally ill.”</p>

<h2 id="starkvilledeniesrequestforlgbtprideparade">Starkville denies request for LGBT pride parade</h2>

<p>Staff Writer</p>

<p>STARKVILLE, MS</p>

<p>The Starkville Board of Aldermen voted to deny the request to hold an LGBT pride parade after hearing 16 people speak in favor of the event during its meeting Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The board approved the motion to deny the request with a 4-3 vote. Ward 1 Alderman Ben Carver, Ward 3 Alderman David Little, Vice Mayor and Ward 6 Alderman Roy A’. Perkins and Ward 7 Alderman Henry Vaughn voted in favor of denying the request.</p>

<p>The motion to deny the request was made by Perkins.</p>

<p>The grassroots group Starkville Pride applied for a special event request to host the 2018 Pride Parade and have city participation with in-kind services. The item was previously on the consent agenda, but was pulled off by Perkins at the beginning of the meeting Ward 2 Alderman Sandra Sistrunk moved to go into executive session at the beginning of the meeting to discuss perspective litigation involving the Pride Parade.</p>

<p>No action was taken during executive session.</p>

<p>CITIZEN COMMENTS</p>

<p>The 16 people who spoke in favor of having the pride parade were made up of Mississippi State University students, Starkville business owners, MSU officials and other citizens.</p>

<p>The two people who spoke against having the parade were resident Dorothy Isaac and pastor of Josey Creek Missionary Baptist Church Thomas Rogers.</p>

<p>Organizer of Starkville Pride and the Pride Parade Bailey McDaniel began the citizen comments asking the aldermen to please approve the parade, because it is an event promoting inclusion and celebration.</p>

<p>“We’re asking you to join us,” McDaniel said.</p>

<p>Owner of the Pop Porium, Rosa Dalomba, said the removal of the item from the consent agenda troubles her because she constantly defends Mississippi to people who live outside of the state. She said she knows Starkville is a community that is growing and becoming more diverse.</p>

<p>“This shocks me that we’re having this conversation in 2018,” Dalomba said.</p>

<p>After a number of people spoke in favor of the parade, resident Dorothy Isaac said she was against the parade because “God created Adam and Eve.”</p>

<p>“Do not turn our city into a sin city,” Isaac said. “It should not be this.”</p>

<p>Resident Kevin Williams came to the podium and said many years ago African American people would be denied the same type of request.</p>

<p>He said this was an opportunity for the city to be on the right side of history with their vote to approve the services for the parade.</p>

<p>Williams said aldermen are afraid to vote in favor of having the parade because of what some constituents have to say, then they are not there for the right reason.</p>

<p>“Now’s the time to lead,” Williams said. “Now, ask yourself this question. What are you afraid of?”</p>

<p>BOARD DISCUSSION</p>

<p>After Perkins made the motion, Ward 4 Alderman Jason Walker asked if the application for the event was correctly filed in terms of hosting a specific event, which it was.</p>

<p>City officials said the Board of Aldermen has not denied a request for any applications that have been properly filed since 2014. If it has been denied or stopped, it was due to an incomplete application.</p>

<p>Mayor Lynn Spruill said she spoke with Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill, who praised the success of the city’s LGBT pride parade.</p>

<p>“I think it is one of those things that shows an inclusiveness in our community that is something I have long said we are,” Spruill said. “We are diverse, we are not divided in my opinion and I don’t want to start having that view of us now.”</p>

<p>She said the parade could be an opportunity for people to come to the downtown area and be a part of a group.</p>

<p>Ward 5 Alderman Patrick Miller said the issue will likely be one of the biggest the city board will face and hopes members will take that into consideration.</p>

<p>“I think you have to ask yourself the question, why wouldn’t we support this?” Miller said.</p>

<p>Miller said beyond it being a personal and social issue, they have to look at this as an economic development issue.</p>

<p>During his discussion, Miller said during the brief break the board took, he noticed a reporter from the Associated Press has taken notice to their possibility of denying the request for the pride parade.</p>

<p>He said if we vote to deny this tonight, there will be another tweet saying the board voted to deny the request and the Associated press has 12. 3 million followers.</p>

<p>“That’s 12.3 million people who immediately formulate a negative opinion about the city of Starkville,” Miller said. “It suddenly becomes what Starkville is not,”</p>

<p>Miller asked the board where do they see themselves in history after this vote, especially with the movement of LGBT rights across the nation.</p>

<p>“I hope you can think about that before you make you’re vote tonight,” Miller said. “It’s more than just our personal beliefs on the board.”</p>

<p>There was no discussion or comments from the board members who voted in favor of denying the parade request.</p>

<p>Carver declined to comment on why he voted for the denial of the parade.</p>

<p>The other three aldermen that voted against the proposed parade did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Spruill said she was “extremely disappointed” with the vote of the board.</p>

<p>“I think it sends a message that we are not the inclusive community that I believe us to be,” Spruill said.</p>

<p>COMMENTS FROM STARKVILLE PRIDE</p>

<p>McDaniel said after hearing the vote, she was shocked by the decision.</p>

<p>"I really wish that the city could have been a part of this historic event for Starkville, but they're not," McDaniel said. "All I can say is that this isn't the last they will hear from us specifically about this issue,"</p>

<p>As for the next steps, McDaniel said their organization will be contacting the ACLU, The Human Rights Campaign and the Southern Poverty Law Center over last night's decision.</p>

<p>"We will be taking action against this," McDaniel said."There was no means to deny our application. It was a perfectly fine application,"</p>

<p>McDaniel referenced House Bill 1523, also known as the "Protecting Freedom of Conscience from government discrimination act" as to why their properly submitted request was denied.</p>

<p>"I don't think they realized what they've just done," McDaniel said.</p>

<p>When asked about potential litigation, Spruill said she is worried about what the future holds.</p>

<p>"There's always a concern when someone wants to sue the city," Spruill said.</p>

<p>Mississippi State Director of the Human Rights Campaign Rob Hill provided a statement to the Starkville Daily News on the boards decision to deny the request for the parade.</p>

<p>"Twice now Starkville has shown it is not supportive of its LGBTQ residents, and the LGBTQ community will not forget," Hill said. "It's disappointing that the Starkville Board of Aldermen would deny LGBTQ people in Starkville the chance to celebrate Pride in their own city."</p>

<p>McDaniel said she wanted to thank the large number of people who came out to show their support of the Pride Parade. She said this isn't what the people of Starkville want, because people of Starkville love the people of Starkville.</p>

<p>When asked what message the vote gives to her, McDaniel said this isn't representative of Starkville and the board of alderman, but of those who voted in favor of the denial.</p>

<p>"This is representative of the aldermen that said they wanted to deny this request," McDaniel said. "This says that, to them, we don't matter."</p>

<h2 id="acluurgesmississippipolicetoadoptaunifiedstatewidebodycampolicy">ACLU urges Mississippi police to adopt a unified statewide body cam policy</h2>

<p>by: Jason Shueh</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-10</p>

<p>url: https://statescoop.com/aclu-urges-mississippi-police-to-adopt-a-unified-statewide-body-cam-policy </p>

<p>The group looked at policies of 65 agencies across the state and found wide disparities in rules and their enforcement.</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi is warning residents that the state’s differing police body camera policies in different jurisdictions could compromise privacy rights.</p>

<p>The ACLU chapter conveyed its privacy fears Monday in a report analyzing 65 local policies of police and sheriff departments throughout Mississippi. The group said the variation in the policies, a lack of police accountability, and the absence of necessary privacy protections demanded action from the state to unify policies statewide.</p>

<p>Nationally, the report represents continued lobbying by the ACLU, privacy advocates and transparency groups across the country to increase oversight of police recordings and increase the adoption of the devices by officers. Such measures can be seen in Washington D.C., where the residents are trying to boost usage by officers not wearing the devices, and in Pennsylannia, where law makers lowered transparency requirements to bolster police usage.</p>

<p>“For body cameras to promote trust between police and the community, police must use them in a way that carefully balances interests in police accountability, government transparency and privacy,” said Blake Feldman, the report’s author and the Mississippi ACLU’s advocacy coordinator for criminal justice reform.</p>

<p>Feldman said the inconsistent policies, gathered through public records requests sent to 147 agencies, held “grave implications for constitutionally protected rights” and set a precedent for unwanted surveillance. Specifically, the report took issue with citizens' inability to tell officers to turn off their cameras when entering their homes, a right allowed to residents in only 20 percent of the reviewed policies, and no requirement in any of the policies for officers to inform residents before they are recorded.</p>

<p>“The lack of uniformity across the state makes it clear that the state must establish certain minimum criteria for policies governing the use of BWCs by agencies choosing to deploy them,” said Jennifer Riley Collins, ACLU of MS Executive Director, in a release.</p>

<p>The goal of the report is to influence politicians in the state legislature to streamline body camera usage in a future bill. The ACLU provided suggestions to craft such legislation through nine recommendations. These recommendations offered remedies to privacy concerns in addition to a recommendation of new disciplinary measures that would allow departments to fire officers who consistently disregarded body camera policies.</p>

<p>When deputies found him, the 15-year-old boy had a knife in each hand and fresh cuts on his neck, his grandmother said.</p>

<p>Seth William Johnson was a cutter who struggled with mental illness before he was shot to death in his own living room by a Harrison County deputy.</p>

<p>He lived with his grandmother, Judy Johnson, at a home on Lake Vista Drive. She's the one who called law enforcement after he took her car the night of Nov. 20. But she never thought it would end in his death.</p>

<p>"He didn't want to die that night," she said. "He was just scared. He had a fear of being locked up."</p>

<p>Seth had been in and out of mental health treatment since he was 5 years old and had recently been released from a second stay at a mental health facility, Johnson said.</p>

<p>She wants to know why Seth had to be killed, why deputies didn't try something else instead of a bullet. She has mixed feelings about the deputy who shot him.</p>

<p>"I know he was doing his job," she said. "I have a grandson going into a police force and if he was put in the situation I wouldn't want him to be harmed."</p>

<p>"I think what they did was unreasonable. They could have done something in another way."</p>

<p>Johnson questioned why a Taser wasn't used instead of a gun. Peterson said a Taser was not used because Seth was too far from the deputies.</p>

<p>Capt. David Dulong fired the fatal shot, Sheriff Troy Peterson said this week after a Harrison County grand jury found no criminal conduct in the teen's death.</p>

<p>Feeling like the 'villain' </p>

<p>Seth was quiet but funny and compassionate, Johnson said, and in many ways like any other teenager.</p>

<p>"He was interested in 15-year-old stuff," she said. "He rode his bike, he liked to play and collect model cars and he listened to music, sometimes very loudly."</p>

<p>A sophomore at West Harrison High, Seth was fascinated with cars. He'd collected more than 350 Matchbox cars since he was a kid. "He could look at any car and tell me what kind it was and the year," Johnson said. "And he would say the funniest things just out of the blue and it would floor me."</p>

<p>But Seth had trouble understanding why he was taken from his parents, who exposed him to drugs, Johnson said.</p>

<p>Related stories from Biloxi Sun Herald</p>

<p>Teen's mental health battle was lost a day too soon </p>

<p>She gained custody of Seth when he was four and his older brother was nine in 2006. She said it took until 2014 before she was allowed to adopt them. After she retired, she moved the family from Bourbonnais, Illinois, to Mississippi in May 2017 to be near her sister.</p>

<p>Seth was coming to terms with being taken from his parents, she said, but for years had felt like she was the "villain" or that he had done something wrong.</p>

<p>He became depressed in August, when he started school at West Harrison High. Seth became quieter but would not share what was bothering him, she said.</p>

<p>Cutting to release</p>

<p>He had been unofficially diagnosed through the years with different mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, Johnson said.</p>

<p>His latest struggle was that he had started to recall what life was like with his parents and it bothered him. For instance, he recalled being given a shot to make him sleep, she said. His older brother recalled the two of them being taken into drug houses.</p>

<p>The last time Seth was hospitalized, he had sent his grandmother a text message asking her to pick him up from school. She asked why.</p>

<p>"I can't hide it anymore," his response said.</p>

<p>Once in the car, he rolled up his long-sleeve shirt and showed her the cuts on his arms. He told her cutting himself made him forget about his emotional pain, Johnson said.</p>

<p>She took him to an emergency room and he was put in a mental health facility. He was released after four days.</p>

<p>Before he was discharged, he was told if he came back to the facility a third time, he would be put in long-term intensive care, Johnson said.</p>

<p>Teen's mental health battle was lost a day too soon</p>

<p>Seth Johnson was 15 when he died in an encounter with law enforcement. His grandmother had made every effort to have his mental health issues treated, but his fear of being put away in an institution was too great.</p>

<p>By John Fitzhugh</p>

<p>The day he died</p>

<p>On the day he died, Seth had cut himself repeatedly from the base of his neck to his chin, Johnson said, showing a picture taken after his death.</p>

<p>Seth then took her car without her permission. Johnson said she called the sheriff's department about 7 p.m. and Seth returned home before deputies arrived.</p>

<p>She went outside and told deputies she wanted them to get help for Seth. Meanwhile, he locked the front door. Johnson gave a deputy her car keys and they opened her garage door.</p>

<p>Johnson said she heard deputies tell Seth they didn't want to hurt him, but wanted to get him help. More patrol cars showed up to her home in the Cypress Pointe subdivision.</p>

<p>A deputy told her to sit in her car and warm up on that chilly night, so Johnson wasn't able to hear most of what happened, she said.</p>

<p>Seth gouged holes in a wall with a knife as he stood near the laundry room while deputies, standing in the garage, tried to talk him into coming with them, according to accounts from the sheriff and Johnson.</p>

<p>At one point, he threatened to kill the deputies, Peterson said.</p>

<p>As negotiations continued, Seth, holding two knives, ran a filet knife across his neck, and deputies tried to stop him from harming himself, Peterson said. They used a less-than-lethal force, firing a bean bag to stop him. But Seth ran toward the living room and deputies fired two more rounds.</p>

<p>Seth had stuck a filet knife in a door near the gouges he had made. Gouges were still in the wall along with a hole when the Sun Herald visited his home this week. His grandmother said a hole in the wall came from the force of a bean bag.</p>

<p>Two deputies ran after Seth as he ran through a hall to the living room, Peterson said.</p>

<p>Seth, still holding a novelty knife, ran toward Dulong, who fired one shot at him, Peterson said.</p>

<p>During the commotion, Johnson heard what she would later learn were the bean-bag shots and she saw a deputy with a rifle kick in her front door.</p>

<p>She rushed in through the garage, stepping over a bean bag, and ran down the hall to see Seth lying on the living room floor in front of a bookcase.</p>

<p>She thought he had been stabbed.</p>

<p>She later learned a bullet entered his side and lodged in his chest cavity.</p>

<p>Peterson said two deputies were in the living room when the fatal shot was fired. Johnson wonders if a deputy was waiting there to shoot him.</p>

<p>She has pieced together much of what happened, but the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, which handled the case, has not told her anything about that night.</p>

<p>Lethal force</p>

<p>Video from deputies' body cameras show what happened the night Seth died, the sheriff said. Peterson said he cannot release videos, citing a possible lawsuit.</p>

<p>The sheriff's department bought 68 body cameras last summer, paying $450,000 with drug forfeiture money.</p>

<p>"Any time there's a death involving an officer, it's not only a tragedy for the family, but it's a tragedy for law enforcement. The last thing we want to do is use lethal force on anybody."</p>

<p>"His grandmother, who is one of the most genuine people I've ever met, and Capt. Dulong have taken this hard. This has hurt us a lot."</p>

<p>Peterson said Dulong became a reserve deputy for the sheriff's department in 2003 and has been a full-time deputy since 2007. Dulong is retired from the Navy and has been on the SWAT team for two years, Peterson said.</p>

<p>The sheriff said he placed Dulong on administrative leave until an internal investigation was completed.</p>

<p>'The system failed'</p>

<p>Seth didn't receive the mental health treatment he needed, Johnson said.</p>

<p>"These hospitals just take you in and keep you a few days," she said. "This last time, they changed his medicine, but he needed more help than that."</p>

<p>Nov. 20 wasn't the first time deputies had contact with Seth, Peterson said. One time, deputies went looking for him in woods after a suicide attempt. Another time, a deputy picked him up and drove him home after he had walked a couple of miles to a store.</p>

<p>"He was a wonderful boy, but he was a troubled boy," Johnson said. "He was a scared boy who had had mental issues since he was taken from his parents. I did everything I could to get him the treatment he needed."</p>

<p>The sheriff said the mental health system let Seth down. The teen wasn't provided adequate treatment, he said, referring in part to a lack of bed space in mental health facilities.</p>

<p>"The sad truth is that mental health care in the state of Mississippi has yet to become prioritized and viewed as a true necessity. Based on the mental health analysis reviewed and received only after this shattering event, it only further shows the true need for these resources to be made available."</p>

<p>Having sufficient resources would provide opportunities to save lives "instead of failing another person and their family, Peterson said.</p>

<h2 id="willeverythingstayinneworleansifcamerascaptureitall">Will everything stay in New Orleans if cameras capture it all?</h2>

<p>by: RICHARD FAUSSET</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-04</p>

<p>url: https://www.sunherald.com/news/local/article198365024.html </p>

<p>Can the allure of this famously rakish and freewheeling city survive if its streets are blanketed by a 1,500-camera video monitoring system?</p>

<p>Will inhibitions start to creep in and diminish the improvisatory nature of street life here, putting a hitch in the strut of Mardi Gras revelers and second-line paraders? Will tourists intent on indulging in a little sin stay away if they think they are being watched?</p>

<p>New Orleans officials, burdened with a seemingly intractable violent crime problem, are considering a plan that would create one of the most extensive video-monitoring systems for any midsize American city. The plan would require every business with an alcohol license to install street-facing security cameras, and connect them to a real-time monitoring center overseen by the city.</p>

<p>But along with typically vexing civil liberties issues, the proposal has sparked concerns that surveillance will somehow suck the soul out of the place, quashing the promise of the Mardi Gras anthem “Do Whatcha Wanna,” which serves as a siren song for tourists and a kind of mission statement for many residents.</p>

<p>The police say that live streams and recorded footage from the cameras would be used primarily to solve violent crimes. But residents such as Daniel Dean, whose livelihood depends on the city’s allure as a place to let one’s hair down, are worried that revelers will lose their taste for revelry under the cameras’ eye.</p>

<p>Under the stage name Atomyc Adonis, Dean performs at Oz, a dance club on that middle stretch of Bourbon Street where the overgrown frat-party vibe turns decidedly, exuberantly gay. He is there Tuesday nights as part of a show called “Bourbon Boylesque.”</p>

<p>He knows that many of his fans, particularly those from the small-town South, count on New Orleans following the Las Vegas rule — that what happens there will stay there.</p>

<p>“People come here to retreat, to let go,” said Dean, 33, whose costumes include thigh-high boots and formal evening wear that does not stay on long. “You’re kind of invading people’s release to be a person that might be seen as provocative or inappropriate.”</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union is no more supportive of the camera proposal than he is. The group has opposed widespread video-monitoring systems in cities such as Chicago and New York, and it has rolled out similar objections to the New Orleans plan: It would threaten privacy rights, have a “disparate racial impact” on people of color, and “threaten to undo much of the progress that’s been made to strengthen the bonds of trust between the community and the police.”</p>

<p>But the debate has also taken on a distinctly local flavor.</p>

<p>“We have a very vibrant public life, where people feel free to express themselves in public — and I’m not just talking about beads and lifting your top on Mardi Gras,” said Bruce Hamilton, a staff attorney with the civil liberties union’s Louisiana branch.</p>

<p>“Everyone acts different when they know the government is watching,” Hamilton said. “Suddenly you’re aware of being watched, and being followed, and it changes how you act.”</p>

<p>The camera plan is part of a broader security overhaul that the administration of Mayor Mitch Landrieu announced last January after a mass shooting on Bourbon Street. It has attracted a barrage of criticism, though, and the administration says it is undergoing some fine-tuning before being put before the City Council.</p>

<p>The city has one of the highest murder rates of any American city, logging 157 murders in 2017 — about half as many as New York City, whose population is more than 20 times as large. The previous year was worse, with 174 murders.</p>

<p>The persistent violence is its own threat to tourism, as well as to the legacy of Landrieu, who will leave office in May after an eight-year run because of term limits.</p>

<p>He asserted this month that another of his signature crime-reduction programs, NOLA for Life — a multifaceted effort to keep young people out of trouble through mentoring, midnight basketball and the like — had made a “significant dent” in violent crime. But Peter Scharf, a crime expert at the Louisiana State University School of Public Health, said it has been difficult to establish a causal link between city policies and crime statistics.</p>

<p>The broad public safety plan announced last year, which included an early version of the camera plan, discussed taking steps to “reduce the culture of permissiveness” in New Orleans. One of its ideas, to force bars to simply close their doors at 3 a.m. (though they could keep serving customers), has already been shelved after a flurry of criticism.</p>

<p>And there are doubts about whether the cameras would achieve their purpose. The city’s Independent Crime Monitor wrote a letter to council members in November, citing studies showing that video monitoring programs elsewhere have often had little effect on violent crime.</p>

<p>The letter noted that “rampant misuse has already presented itself within similar systems in the USA,” and cited a review of London camera monitoring that found abuses like voyeuristic monitoring of women’s bodies and a tendency to over-monitor black people.</p>

<p>Though the plan to require them on private property is still being debated, New Orleans is already installing scores of cameras and license-plate readers on public property, concentrated in 20 crime “hot spots” around the city. Last fall, the city opened a Real Time Crime Monitoring Center, with a huge wall of screens showing video feeds of street scenes, in a building at the edge of the French Quarter.</p>

<p>A block away at the Black Penny, a tiny bar on North Rampart Street, grousing over the cameras was easy to find. “It’s going to be very clinical — it’s going to take the mystique, the romanticism out of the city,” said Alyx Gauthier, 27, a local service-industry worker who was nursing a pint on a recent afternoon. “This city was built by pirates and whores,” she said.</p>

<p>Inside the new monitoring center, Michael S. Harrison, the police superintendent, seemed mildly annoyed by the criticism. “I don’t think it’s going to change the nature of the city the way this citizen that you spoke to characterized it,” he said. “I think it’s going to change the nature of this city because criminals, who have in their heart, mind and soul to commit violent harm against other citizens, will think differently.”</p>

<p>Aaron Miller, the city’s director of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the idea was partially inspired by Detroit’s Project Green Light, which allows businesses there to set up surveillance cameras that feed into a city monitoring system. That system, though, is voluntary.</p>

<p>Miller said that when a 911 dispatcher in New Orleans gets a report of a serious crime, software at the monitoring center will automatically call up video from the cameras nearest to the scene.</p>

<p>If the wider plan goes ahead, the police will also be able to quickly draw on the cameras of business owners, who will be required to keep 14 days’ worth of footage stored online. Miller said the center itself was under video surveillance, and that use of video footage is automatically logged and tracked as a precaution against voyeurism, blackmail or other abuses.</p>

<p>Some local advocates for immigrants are concerned that federal officials might try to use the system to ferret out undocumented people. But Harrison said that he would not allow that.</p>

<p>“People are not under surveillance,” Harrison said. “We want to make that clear.”</p>

<p>The 22-page public safety proposal includes other provisions that make bar owners bristle. One would allow an alcohol license to be suspended if the city receives five written complaints from nearby property owners or residents.</p>

<p>At the Café Lafitte in Exile on Bourbon Street, the bar owners’ objections to the plan have been printed up on a large poster that hangs near the entrance. On Wednesday, Ryan Hughes, who works at the bar, directed a reporter to the poster while a quartet of patrons in neon-dyed beards looked on. One of them was holding a potbellied pig.</p>

<p>“It’s almost like a direct attack on the bar culture in this city,” Hughes said.</p>

<p>Away from the tourist trail, however, the opinions are not so uniform. From his porch in a working-class stretch of the Upper Ninth Ward, Kelby Reed, 31, gestured to the parking lot of a corner store a few doors down.</p>

<p>“That store had some shootings and stuff before, so it might help with that,” Reed said of the camera proposal.</p>

<p>Katherine Prevost, the head of the Ninth Ward’s Bunny Friend Neighborhood Association, said the cameras might help provide evidence about violent crimes when local residents are reluctant to call the police.</p>

<p>“They could put cameras everywhere, as far as I care,” Prevost said. “If you’re doing the right thing anyway, the cameras shouldn’t matter.”</p>

<h2 id="mississippimightbanabortionafter15weeks">Mississippi Might Ban Abortion After 15 Weeks</h2>

<p>by: Linley Sanders</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-08</p>

<p>Updated on March 8 at 3:15 p.m.</p>

<p>The Mississippi House has passed a bill that would ban abortion after 15 weeks, according to the Associated Press, making the state one step closer to passing the strictest abortion laws in the country.</p>

<p>The AP reports the House voted 75-34 to pass the ban, outlawing abortion after 15 weeks. The Senate approved the bill on March 6. According to the AP, Gov. Phil Bryant has indicated support for the bill, saying he plans to sign it into law.</p>

<p>The bill includes two exceptions to the ban, according to the AP. An abortion after 15 weeks would be permitted if the mother's life or “major bodily function” was at risk because of a pregnancy, or if the fetus had a health issue that would prevent it from surviving after being born at full term.</p>

<p>Republicans in Mississippi are pushing forward with a policy that could create the most restrictive abortion law in the United States.</p>

<p>The proposed legislation would ban most abortions in Mississippi just 15 weeks after a pregnant woman’s last menstrual period with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. The bill was introduced by Republican Representative Becky Currie and is based on a vastly-disputed belief that abortions carry various “significant physical and psychological risks” for women that “increase” with each week of pregnancy.</p>

<p>A woman’s right to choose an abortion is often clouded by false narratives and myths about the procedure—especially by politicians and special interest groups. NARAL Pro-Choice America condemned the bill as a “strategic move by the anti-choice movement to make Mississippi the first state where legal abortion is no longer accessible.”</p>

<p>The organization believes that Mississippi is leading an “immensely concerning” national trend where anti-abortion advocates seek to make the procedure wholly inaccessible by chipping away at constitutional abortion access.</p>

<p>Mississippi’s current law bans most abortions after 20 weeks, and it’s one of six U.S. states that rely on a singular abortion clinic in 2018. The other states with one clinic—Kentucky, West Virginia, Wyoming, South Dakota, North Dakota—also have GOP-controlled legislatures.</p>

<p>Mississippi’s final clinic — the Jackson Women's Health Organization — performs abortions up to 16 weeks, according to The Clarion Ledger. If the abortion ban is signed into law, clinic owner Diane Derzis promised to sue Mississippi, saying she was “not surprised” by the bill’s quick introduction and advancement.</p>

<p>“Phil Bryant has never seen an abortion bill he didn't like,” Derzis told the Clarion Ledger.</p>

<p>The ACLU of Mississippi additionally warned that if the bill is signed into law, it will end up at the center of an inevitable legal battle. Anti-abortion advocacy organizations have long-encouraged lawmakers to introduce abortion bans that could eventually lead to a constitutional challenge of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision which secured women’s right to choose an abortion.</p>

<p>The ACLU said on Twitter that, “We cannot allow those who want to put abortion completely out of reach to pass another law that stands in the way of women and the care they need.”</p>

<p>The Mississippi Senate voted Tuesday, March 6, to approve the state abortion ban, and it is expected to receive secondary approval from the Mississippi House on small changes. If accepted by both chambers in the Mississippi legislature, it will be sent to Republican Governor Phil Bryant’s desk for his signature. Bryant has already made a statement that he supports the bill.</p>

<h2 id="olemissupdchiefcandidateopenforuminterviewsbegintoday">Ole Miss UPD chief candidate open forum interviews begin today</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-03-01</p>

<p>url: http://thedmonline.com/ole-miss-upd-chief-candidate-open-forum-interviews-begin-today/ </p>

<p>The Division of Student Affairs is holding open forum interviews on campus for UPD’s next police chief, beginning today.</p>

<p>The final stages of the Division of Student Affairs’ search for the next UPD police chief begins with Terence Calloway. The interview process continues with sessions for Jackie Allan Gilbert on March 7, Ray Hawkins on March 8 and Stephanie Hill on March 9.</p>

<p>Vice chancellor for student affairs Brandi Hephner LaBanc said it’s not uncommon to hold interviews of this kind on campus.</p>

<p>“It’s actually pretty common protocol that we have an open forum and really in this case because our police chief works a lot with extra law enforcement and other agencies,” Hephner LaBanc said.</p>

<p>Ahead of the interviews, an email was sent to all students with information on the forums and copies of each candidate’s resume.</p>

<p>Terrence Calloway has worked in law enforcement for 18 years, beginning as a patrol officer before serving as chief of police in Woodmere, Ohio, and at Austin Peay State University. He currently serves as assistant vice president of Safety and Parking Services and chief of police at Florida A&amp;M University.</p>

<p>Jackie Allan Gilbert has worked as a police officer since 1994. He has worked with the United States Secret Service and helped supervise special operations units on the protection details and motorcades for the 2008 presidential debate at Ole Miss between President Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain. Between 2009 and 2014, Gilbert worked as an FBI Task Force officer and worked with ESPN College GameDay to provide terrorism overwatch and security for football games. He currently serves as deputy chief of police for the Tupelo Police Department and Crime Stoppers coordinator for Northeast Mississippi.</p>

<p>Ray Hawkins is an Ole Miss graduate and has worked with the University of Mississippi Department of Police and Campus Safety for more than 20 years. He has served as a field training officer, lieutenant of Special Services, commander of Protective Service Team – SWAT, police lieutenant and detective lieutenant, among other positions. He currently serves as associate director of UPD.</p>

<p>Stephanie Hill has worked in law enforcement since 1997. She served as director of Public Safety and chief of police at Chattanooga State Community College Police Department for five years. She is currently director of Public Safety and chief of police at Central State University in Ohio.</p>

<p>Each interview will occur at 3 p.m. in the Multipurpose Room in the Center for Manufacturing Excellence on the day of each candidate’s interview. A question-and-answer session with faculty, staff and students will follow.</p>

<p>Everyone in the Ole Miss community is welcome to attend the presentations and is encouraged to provide feedback on the candidates.</p>

<p>“This is our chief of police. It’s a very important position on our campus,” Hephner LaBanc said. “It’s a position that serves the community, so we want the feedback of students, faculty and staff saying, ‘This is the person that I would trust in that position and someone that I could see moving the university forward.’”</p>

<p>Former UPD Chief of Police Tim Potts announced his resignation in January and has since returned to his home state of Indiana. Potts headed UPD for nearly three years and now serves as a police chief at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne. Ole Miss posted the open police chief position to its job site at the beginning of 2018.</p>

<p>Hephner LaBanc said there is no exact date set to announce the new hire because of background checks, clearance with the HR department and taking time to review feedback, but the university officials hope to have someone in the position as quickly as they can.</p>

<h2 id="coronershomiciderulinginblackmansdeathspotlightsasheriffsresistancetobodycameras">Coroner’s homicide ruling in black man’s death spotlights a sheriff’s resistance to body cameras</h2>

<p>by: Alan Pyke</p>

<p>Police killed a 22-year-old black man who’d fled after officers in plain clothes and unmarked cars raced up on him in a gas station parking lot last week, a Louisiana coroner announced Monday.</p>

<p>Bruising on Keeven Robinson’s neck suggests someone compressed his neck prior to his death of asphyxiation, prompting Jefferson Parish coroner Gerry Cvitanovich to rule the death a homicide. The initial coroner’s finding does not force legal action, but Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joseph Lopinto said he had moved four detectives to desk duty and had each man formally Mirandized and interviewed with Louisiana State Police representatives present.</p>

<p>More than a hundred people joined Robinson’s family in a march through the streets near where he was killed after the coroner’s initial findings were released. Lopinto told NOLA.com he thought Robinson’s history of asthma probably caused his death, but also acknowledged his officers had used force on the man while pledging a thorough investigation of whether their actions were reasonable.</p>

<p>Video from a security camera at the gas station where Robinson had been parked captures the moment when officers initiated the confrontation. The officers zip up almost simultaneously, suggesting they were employing a tactic known elsewhere as a “jumpout,” where cops hope that surprise and speed will help them subdue someone they want to talk to.</p>

<p>An unmarked sedan blocks Robinson’s rear, but a second pulls alongside him instead of blocking his natural escape route. Robinson’s dark sedan almost immediately pulls off, and all three vehicles quickly leave the security camera’s frame, pursued by a red pickup truck that was not part of the initial scramble.</p>

<p>Precisely what happened after that is anyone’s guess. Within a few minutes, though, Robinson was dead in handcuffs in a backyard of a house up the street.</p>

<p>There is no police video of the foot chase. The Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office has opted not to seek body-worn cameras for its deputies even as other departments find the devices useful in calming public outcry after shootings and violent arrests. Lopinto’s predecessor Newell Normand said the cameras encourage “Monday-morning quarterbacking” of law enforcement decisions, in a 2015 interview explaining why he had not and would not support adding the equipment.</p>

<p>Even if Lopinto had moved to reverse Normand, who retired last year to take a gig hosting a local talk radio show, there probably wouldn’t be video to clarify how exactly Robinson got dead. The officers were working plainclothes that day. The sudden, tire-squealing approach of non-uniformed men with guns can be hard to distinguish from a robbery or carjacking attempting, and numerous high-profile incidents involving plainclothes cops suggest that people respond differently than officers are trained to expect when the cops who approach them aren’t in uniform.</p>

<p>What feels to the officers in sneakers and polos like a normal police action seems to the civilian like an ambush by strangers, making it more likely they’ll flee or act to defend themselves than they might when surrounded by easily identified police. “Because you’re not wearing a uniform, if you roll up on a couple of guys, they might think they’re getting robbed, they might start shooting right away,” retired New York Police Department Sergeant Joe Giacalone told The Intercept recently.</p>

<p>This kind of adrenalizing unannounced roll-up tactic – known for decades in major city policing as a “jump-out” – is the bread and butter of plainclothes narcotics work. Born in the depths of the War on Drugs, the tactic has proved stubbornly persistent even as official policies on plainclothes work change in cities like Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Plainclothes work is deeply laced into police tradition, both as a status marker between officers with different types of responsibilities and as an essential tool for surveillance. Start tinkering with plainclothes work, and you’re likely to be seen as attacking the soul of policing tradition. The former Police Commissioner in Baltimore decided to end plainclothes work entirely as a way of ending jump-outs for good, only to get fired in short order as patience for his hardline reform agenda ran short.</p>

<p>The most scandalous incidents implicating plainclothes tactics have occurred in major coastal cities like New York, Baltimore, Washington, and Los Angeles. But the jump-out boys are by no means limited to big-city policework, or to the densely populated tracts between the Mississippi River and Lake Ponchartrain where the Jefferson Parish deputies tried to ambush Robinson.</p>

<p>A Mississippi sheriff’s department was accused last year of enforcing segregation through racially motivated checkpoints and aggressive jump-out raids. Plainclothes cops jumping out of an unmarked car in Columbus, Ohio, in 2016 made a threatening remark and then shot Henry “Bub” Green dead as he walked toward his house with a friend. Milwaukee police’s use of the tactic has drawn controversy in both fatal encounters and non-fatal ones.</p>

<h2 id="areturntodebtorsprisonsjeffsessionswaronthepoor">A Return to Debtors’ Prisons: Jeff Sessions’ War on the Poor</h2>

<p>by: Sophie Tesfaye Salon</p>

<p>One day after President Donald Trump invited Republican lawmakers to the White House to celebrate the historic tax cuts they passed for corporations and wealthy business leaders, his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, quietly reinstated a draconian policy that effectively serves as a regressive tax on America’s poorest people.</p>

<p>A symbol of Victorian England’s inequitable nature made infamous by Charles Dickens, debtors’ prisons were banned in the United States in 1833. The Supreme Court has affirmed the unconstitutionality of jailing those too poor to pay debts on three different occasion in the last century, finding that the 14th Amendment prohibits incarceration for non-payment of exorbitant court-imposed fines or fees without an assessment of a person’s ability to pay and alternatives for those who cannot. “Punishing a person for his poverty” is illegal, the Court said. Yet in recent years the modern-day equivalent of debtors’ prisons have returned, as cities have grown to rely on a punishing regime of fines and fees imposed on their own residents as a major stream of revenue.</p>

<p>Routine traffic tickets or even overdue student loan payments can set off a cycle of debt that also includes the suspension of a driver’s license or professional license and, in some cases, jail time. A suspended driver’s license makes it nearly impossible to get to work. When a person can’t pay, courts add more fines on top of the original. If those fees aren’t paid, a jail sentence is imposed. Incarceration is also often meted out to low-income defendants facing misdemeanor charges who cannot afford to pay bond ahead of a court date. It should come as little surprise that the policing tactics that have been enacted to generate revenue through this debtors’ system disproportionately impact people of color.</p>

<p>The protests in Ferguson, Missouri, following the shooting death of Michael Brown brought national scrutiny to the practice. Ferguson police sought to advance the “city’s focus on revenue rather than … public safety needs,” an investigation by the Obama-era Department of Justice found. Ironically, the judge who most frequently sent Ferguson residents to overcrowded prisons for their petty fines not only personally benefited from the system — he moonlighted as a both a prosecutor and a private attorney when he was not sitting on the bench — but also owed more than $170,000 in unpaid taxes. A 2014 Washington Post investigation found that some towns in Missouri derived 40 percent or more of their annual revenue from the hefty fines and fees collected by municipal courts.</p>

<p>This routine incarceration of poor people attracted the attention of the Obama administration, which eventually issued a guidance advising courts across the United States against “slapping poor defendants with fines and fees to fill their jurisdictions’ coffers.” The March 2016 letter did not, however, threaten any specific enforcement action for those who ignored it.</p>

<p>Apparently less concerned with the plethora of jurisdictions effectively funding their operations on the backs of their poorest residents, Sessions explained that he sought to do away with “the long-standing abuse of issuing rules by simply publishing a letter or posting a web page.” After ordering a reform task force to identify “existing guidance documents that go too far,” the attorney general revoked more than two dozen such documents going back to 1975 on various topics, including a Reagan-era “industry circular” that stated it was illegal to ship certain guns across state line. He also issued a memo last month barring the Department of Justice from issuing nonbinding guidances.</p>

<p>“Congress has provided for a regulatory process in statute, and we are going to follow it,” Sessions said in a statement. Most, but not all, of the guidances were enacted under the Obama administration.</p>

<p>Sessions’ move, while little noticed in the mainstream press or by the public, has already proven unpopular.</p>

<p>“These monetary punishments do nothing to protect the community while placing an unfair and unjust burden on people of lesser means,” wrote American Bar Association president Hilarie Bass in a statement.</p>

<p>“This latest action must be viewed alongside other actions taken by the attorney general to turn back the clock on civil rights compliance across the country,” said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Other actions she cited included “abandoning use of consent decrees as a vehicle for promoting constitutional policing practices, reversing positions in pending civil rights cases and bringing federal civil rights enforcement to a virtual grinding halt.”</p>

<p>The author of the Obama-era guidance on debtors’ prisons, Lisa Foster, who served as director of the Office for Access to Justice at the DOJ, criticized Sessions’ move. “The idea that the Department of Justice doesn’t care about the United States Constitution in courts is so wrong, and really unfortunate. It is a message that should not be sent, and has practical implications,” she told the Law&amp;Crime blog.</p>

<p>But the letter’s co-author, Vanita Gupta, who served as head of the Justice Department’s civil rights division in the Obama administration, thinks Sessions is already too late to cause too much damage.</p>

<p>“The retraction of this guidance doesn’t change the existing legal framework,” she reminded The New York Times. “He can retract the guidance, but he can’t change what the law says.” Indeed, as the ACLU has noted:</p>

<p>Several weeks ago, a federal court ruled that New Orleans judges faced a conflict of interest in jailing poor people for unpaid fines because the judges control the money collected and rely on it for court funding. That same week, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction halting Michigan’s system for suspending driver’s licenses upon non-payment of traffic tickets due to constitutional concerns. And days later, the Mississippi Department of Public Safety agreed to reinstate the driver’s licenses of all drivers whose licenses were suspended for non-payment of court fines and fees.</p>

<p>In Missouri, where the troubling resurgence of debtors’ prisons first gained national attention, more than a dozen plaintiffs won a class action lawsuit filed against 13 St. Louis suburbs they accused of “conspiring” to “extort money” from poor African-American residents via traffic tickets in “a deliberate and coordinated scheme.” Even in Sessions’ home state of Alabama, a Republican state legislator has sponsored legislation that would do away with debtors’ prison.</p>

<p>Fighting a losing battle seems to be Sessions’ forte. Just this week, the attorney general traveled to three states to declare that a crime wave is sweeping the nation.</p>

<p>“Let’s be frank, violent crime has been increasing in Milwaukee and throughout America and it’s troubling,” he said in Wisconsin. “As attorney general, I am committed to combating the surge in violent crime and supporting the work of our police officers,” he said the same day in North Carolina.</p>

<p>But a report released Wednesday by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law indicates that he rates for overall crime, violent crime and murder are all projected to drop in the 30 largest cities in 2017. Even according to statistics released by Sessions’ own Justice Department in September, the violent crime rate remains at historically low levels.</p>

<p>JACKSON, MS (Mississippi News Now) -</p>

<p>A Jackson councilman wants to decriminalize the use of marijuana in the city.</p>

<p>Tuesday Councilman De'Keither Stamps was joined by organizations in support of lessening penalties.</p>

<p>READ MORE: Jackson councilman pushing to decriminalize marijuana use</p>

<p>"We can stop turning users into criminals, but focus our efforts on hard drugs," Stamps told Jackson Council members after his ordinance to amend the city code was read.</p>

<p>He wants to change Chapter 86 Article III of the Jackson Code of Ordinances.</p>

<p>The Ward Four representative's proposal would decriminalize marijuana possession in the city.</p>

<p>He proposes limiting the maximum penalty for possession of 30 grams or less to a $100 fine, with no prison time.</p>

<p>"Hopefully, this is the beginning of multiple agencies taking the same stance focusing on murder and heroin and opioids and those things that are really ripping apart people's lives," said Stamps.</p>

<p>Prior to the council session, Stamps held a news conference.</p>

<p>The councilman was joined by members of the ACLU, the Mississippi Cannabis Coalition and others in support of the measure.</p>

<p>"The enforcement of marijuana laws generates some of justice's starkest racial disparities," said MS ACLU Executive Director Jennifer Riley-Collins. "A black person is almost four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person, despite almost equal use."</p>

<p>Dave Singletary, with the MS Cannabis Coalition, applauds the city's efforts and wants full recreational legalization of marijuana in the state.</p>

<p>"This is the first step in the direction for justice reform in the state of Mississippi, and also to relieve suppression of certain minorities in the state that are unfairly singled out by this war on drugs," said Singletary.</p>

<p>Stamps hopes the city passes the amendment to join 13 other states including: Atlanta, Memphis, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and Washington D.C. which have lessen penalties for personal possession.</p>

<p>No action was taken and the amendment will appear on the February 13 council agenda.</p>

<p>TUPELO, Miss. (WCBI) – Fifth and sixth graders are spending 2 weeks learning about the dangers of illegal drugs and the importance of making wise decisions.</p>

<p>The Tupelo Police Department is hosting its annual “DARE Camp.” That camp allows participants to take field trips, like the Oren Dunn Museum and Tupelo’s Veteran’s Museum.</p>

<p>They’ll also learn about the importance of healthy lifestyles and choices and how to make wise choices.</p>

<p>“If you are around second-hand smoke, somebody that you’re around smoking, you can get lung cancer from that,” said DARE camper Janiya Rogers.</p>

<p>Around that age group, kids are starting to mature a little bit, so they understand that terminology that we use, referring to drugs and also using coping skills and making good decisions,” said Tupelo Resource Officer Tremaine Frison. “At that age they’re more attentive and understand terminology and can apply it to everyday lives.</p>

<p>STARKVILLE and LOUISVILLE, Miss. (WCBI) – Across Mississippi, more and more law enforcement agencies are requiring their officers to use body cameras.</p>

<p>Now, a national organization is asking the State to standardize how they use them.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi released a report, highlighting what they call, the lack of uniformity in body camera regulations.</p>

<p>“This will charge the device and it will upload the information to the server,” says Starkville Police Public Information Officer, Brandon Lovelady.</p>

<p>That’s what Starkville Police Officers do after every shift.</p>

<p>They dump their body cam video into a server, where it stays for a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>“It can be viewed by the officer, as well as the supervisor, as well as me. So, but yeah, we maintain those videos for at least 45 days and if it’s a DUI, or any kind of a domestic crime, we try to preserve those videos for at least a year,” says Starkville Police Chief Frank Nichols.</p>

<p>The average lifespan for body cam video at the Louisville Police Department is 30 days.</p>

<p>“The video cameras that we’re using have 16 gigabytes of memory and when the officers are only running the camera when they are in contact with the public. Most of the time, it’s only necessary to download it about once a month. They get about that much run time out of it,” says Louisville Police Chief L.M. Claiborne.</p>

<p>The video lifespan is different for both departments, but one thing that’s not different, is how their body and patrol car cameras work together.</p>

<p>“Chances are, if the officer encounters you and he’s within sight of, straight-line sight of his patrol unit, there’s probably two cameras running at the same time, but then, if he’s out of sight of his unit, inside of someone’s home, or business, or something, then it’s just a body camera,” says Claiborne.</p>

<p>Claiborne says each department adopts its own rules for handling video evidence, and Chief Nichols believes it would be hard to create a “one size fits all” policy statewide.</p>

<p>“You’ll find out that most of the agencies that are accredited, they have a similar policy, but not all agencies are accredited and those ones that are not accredited, you know, they wouldn’t have the same policies I would, because they might not have the resources that Starkville Police Department has, so I think it’s a resource thing.”</p>

<p>Both police departments say body cams are very important because they provide transparency with the public and safety for the officers.</p>

<p>MADISON, MS (Mississippi News Now) -</p>

<p>New developments have been made in the deadly deputy-involved shooting that in Madison County over the weekend.</p>

<p>Officials from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation identified the victim as 36-year-old Michael Renfroe.</p>

<p>His wife Amanda Renfroe shared her side of the story, saying that her husband was unarmed and on the ground when he was shot three times.</p>

<p>Tonight, Madison County sheriff's have a different recall events.</p>

<p>RELATED: Wife: Husband unarmed when he was shot three times by Madison Co. Sheriff's deputy</p>

<p>Sheriff Randy Tucker is defending his deputy by saying the widow of Michael Renfroe is not telling the truth about what happened Friday night, and his deputy was acting in self-defense.</p>

<p>“No. He had nothing in his hands," said Amanda Renfroe. "His hands were on his sides and out walking."</p>

<p>Amanda said they were driving on Old Natchez Trace Road Friday night when her husband’s staff stick fell out of the window and he stopped to get it...that's when she says a vehicle pulled up with no lights.</p>

<p>"He didn't know who it was, so he kept walking," Amanda said.</p>

<p>She claims this led to the deputy tasing him and when he tried to turnover on the ground, he was shot.</p>

<p>“It was a pow. Then it was a short pause, then a pow, pow. He had three bullet holes in him.”</p>

<p>Sheriff Tucker says that story is false.</p>

<p>He says Michael Renfroe attacked his deputy and he was not shot on the ground.</p>

<p>Tucker says the department has video evidence to back his claim and once MBI completes their investigation, it could possibly be released.</p>

<p>According to Jackson police records, Renfroe had no prior criminal record.</p>

<p>While some folks agree deputies should defend themselves, others say they have become too "trigger happy."</p>

<p>“They never know what they are going to run up on," said a Madison resident. "From a domestic call of traffic stop."</p>

<p>“An officer is always going to defend an officer,” another resident said.</p>

<p>Sheriff Tucker says this is a very tragic situation for both the deputy’s family and the victim’s family.</p>

<p>The deputy is still on the job and was offered time off after the shooting.</p>

<p>JACKSON, MS (Mississippi News Now) -</p>

<p>The Jackson City Council met Tuesday to talk about several topics, including Jackson police using body cameras.</p>

<p>The city council meeting had several very important topics in the agenda. One of them was the update on JPD's uniforms and that comes in the form of body camera's.</p>

<p>After a vote, the city leaders approved the mayor's submission of the 2018 body worn cameras.</p>

<p>The body cameras come in the form of a $600,000 grant application from the department of justice.</p>

<p>City Councilman Kenneth Stokes believes this is an update that has been a long time coming, and pointed that out to the mayor at city hall.</p>

<p>"I think this will be a step in the right direction," said Stokes. "Everybody won't agree with it, but I think the majority will. Mr. Mayor, kudos to you and Chief Moore. We can't lose the confidence of the citizens. It was too hard to get the citizens and the police to work together. We just can't go back to those days." .</p>

<p>LAUREL, MS (WDAM) -</p>

<p>The Laurel Police Department announced the termination of two of its officers Monday following an internal investigation into alleged police brutality.</p>

<p>In the press conference, LPD Captain Tommy Cox and Laurel Mayor Johnny Magee addressed the allegations made by 36-year-old James Barnett, who said officers repeatedly kicked him in the face following a chase.</p>

Tommy Cox says two officers have been terminated following this investigation, where a man says he was kicked repeatedly in the face after a chase.</h1>

<p>— Melissa Egan (@_MelissaEgan) May 21, 2018</p>
<p><a href="https://t.co/bnoDE9kjhJ">link</a></p>

<p>While many on social media asked if officers had body cameras and commented about seeing the footage, Cox said the footage would not be released at this time because of the ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>In January, the ACLU of Mississippi released a detailed analysis of 65 state law enforcement agencies' use of body-worn cameras. The report, "Striking the Right Balance," detailed a lack of uniformity across state agencies and policies that lack basic privacy safeguards and bare-minimum accountability provisions.</p>

<p>"What we found was there was a lack of uniformity," said Jennifer Riley Collins, the Executive Director for the ACLU of Mississippi.</p>

<p>The Laurel Police Department was one of those 65 departments included in the report. WDAM spoke to Collins Monday about the alleged police brutality case.</p>

<p>Reporter: "Is it really enhancing transparency if the public's not getting a look at any of that footage?"</p>

<p>Collins: "Well actually, No. That's why we are advocating, continue to advocate and have advocated for body cam policies that allow for public disclosure on videos of public concern, and when you have law enforcement officers acting in an unprofessional matter, that is clearly a matter of public concern."</p>

<p>With public information, law enforcement agencies do not have to release some information, like body or dash camera video, due to ongoing investigations. Collins said that is constantly referred to in agencies across the state.</p>

<p>"What we would want the Laurel Police Department to do and law enforcement agencies across the state is not hide behind this 'ongoing investigation' exception, but in due diligence release the footage to the community, but at a minimum," said Collins.</p>

<p>WDAM spoke with Laurel Captain Tommy Cox about the department's policy back in January when the report was released.</p>

<p>"It's great back up, in this day and age, whether we like it or not,everyone wants video," said Cox. "It's hard to refute something when you're on camera."</p>

<p>According to the 'Patrol Vehicle/Body Camera' policy for the Laurel Police Department, provided through the ACLU report, all officers on duty are to have cameras activated when responding to incident.</p>

<p>WDAM asked Cox how many officers had the cameras recording, but that information was not released.</p>

<p>"We believe that it is imperative that body cams be used for mode accountability and law enforcement officers use the body cam mechanisms in a way that ensures accountability and transparency," said Collins.</p>

<p>The ACLU provided a model policy in the report for balancing police accountability and privacy protection.</p>

<p>Jackson Councilman Kenneth Stokes plans to ask the city council to approve the purchase of body cameras for the Jackson Police Department. Stokes says the recent officer-involved shootings resulting in the deaths of the suspects, has driven a wedge between Jacksonians and police officers.</p>

<p>Stokes says equipping Jackson police officers with body cameras will increase accountability in the interactions between police and citizens and dispel rumors.</p>

<p>"Some might feel that it may not solve the problem but we have a step in the right direction when it comes to evidence," said Stokes. "We need to make sure we have evidence of police officers doing right and evidence against a police officer doing wrong."</p>

<p>Stokes says he has talked to some council members about the issue.</p>

<p>He says some are concerned about funding and feel the money that would be spent on body cameras could be used to upgrade equipment or give officers raises.</p>

<p>A Jackson councilman wants to decriminalize the use of marijuana in the city.</p>

<p>Tuesday Councilman De'Keither Stamps was joined by organizations in support of lessening penalties.</p>

<p>READ MORE: Jackson councilman pushing to decriminalize marijuana use</p>

<p>"We can stop turning users into criminals, but focus our efforts on hard drugs," Stamps told Jackson Council members after his ordinance to amend the city code was read.</p>

<p>He wants to change Chapter 86 Article III of the Jackson Code of Ordinances.</p>

<p>The Ward Four representative's proposal would decriminalize marijuana possession in the city.</p>

<p>He proposes limiting the maximum penalty for possession of 30 grams or less to a $100 fine, with no prison time.</p>

<p>"Hopefully, this is the beginning of multiple agencies taking the same stance focusing on murder and heroin and opioids and those things that are really ripping apart people's lives," said Stamps.</p>

<p>Prior to the council session, Stamps held a news conference.</p>

<p>The councilman was joined by members of the ACLU, the Mississippi Cannabis Coalition and others in support of the measure.</p>

<p>"The enforcement of marijuana laws generates some of justice's starkest racial disparities," said MS ACLU Executive Director Jennifer Riley-Collins. "A black person is almost four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person, despite almost equal use."</p>

<p>Dave Singletary, with the MS Cannabis Coalition, applauds the city's efforts and wants full recreational legalization of marijuana in the state.</p>

<p>"This is the first step in the direction for justice reform in the state of Mississippi, and also to relieve suppression of certain minorities in the state that are unfairly singled out by this war on drugs," said Singletary.</p>

<p>Stamps hopes the city passes the amendment to join 13 other states including: Atlanta, Memphis, New Orleans, Pittsburgh and Washington D.C. which have lessen penalties for personal possession.</p>

<p>No action was taken and the amendment will appear on the February 13 council agenda.</p>

<p>url: https://wgno.com/2018/06/18/the-national-sheriffs-association-introduces-new-drone-technology-for-law-enforcement/ </p>

<p>NEW ORLEANS -- The National Sheriff's Association has gathered at the Ernest Morial Convention Center to display some new high tech gear for officers.</p>

<p>"Now, there is so much technology that helps them do their job and keep our community safe. Here they come to see that. They also get to get training, they get to share ideas with each other, it's just the one time a year they can pull together and help each other and see what's out there," says John Thompson, director of the NSA.</p>

<p>This year's exhibitors are featuring accessories like drones that attach to the back of your cellphone, showcasing tricked out law enforcement fleet, and introducing technology that should help officers stay safe and accountable.</p>

<p>"We created a holster for law enforcement that when they break leather, it engages the body camera. When they remove the firearm from their holster, it sends a second message to their body camera," says spokesperson for the European American Armoy, Keith Bernkrant.</p>

<p>If you like virtual reality training simulators, they have that too!</p>

<p>We met up with Jones County, Mississippi's sheriff, Alex Hodge, who jumped into a simulator that helps law enforcement practice how to act when coming across a canine.</p>

<p>"This scenario helps us to be more aware of our surroundings when it comes to animals. We love our dogs, we love our animals. Most animals are not aggressive, and as you saw in our encounter here, I had an opportunity to be able to talk down an animal to be able to render aid to the victim," says Hodge.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, these officers agree there is no ceiling when it comes to learning new ways to improve law enforcement.</p>

<p>The expo continues through Tuesday, June 18th from 9:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. as a jail training day designed for corrections and detention personnel.</p>

<h2 id="vtoxattheardenaneducationintheinhumanityinequityofmassincarceration">‘V to X’ at the Arden an education in the inhumanity, inequity of mass incarceration</h2>

<p>by: Howard Shapiro</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-04</p>

<p>url: https://whyy.org/articles/v-to-x-at-the-arden-an-education-in-the-inhumanity-and-inequity-of-mass-incarceration/ </p>

<p>You need only look at the front page of Wednesday’s New York Times to see the relevance of Kash Goins’ play “V to X,” at the Arden Theatre, about an appalling privately run prison and its inmates. That prison is fictional. The Times chronicles the current case against the real company that operated the East Mississippi Correctional Facility: prisoners so badly beaten they required hospitalization, pleas for medical attention ignored, fires set by inmates, and undisciplined guards.</p>

<p>Since 2000, the Times says, the national prison population has risen about 10 percent, yet the number of inmates in privately operated prisons has risen 45 percent. States and the federal government are turning over the incarceration to big business. Jailed offenders are “human capital,” the phrase an administrator uses in “V to X” when he slips up in front of a tour group.</p>

<p>The tour group is us, the audience, and the jail we see in Goins’ play is run by the fictional U.S. Prisons Corporation. The talented Goins is a prolific producer, actor, and playwright. He is an African-American artist from South Philadelphia who specializes in theater about being black in America. He first produced his “V to X” – a reference to five-to-10, as in years in prison – three years ago. Now, in a two-year residency at the Arden, Goins revives his disturbing — at times, chilling — play, directing an A-1 cast.</p>

<p>“V to X” is not a play you like, nor is it one you’re supposed to like. It unfolds with stinging realism, raw power, and a constant base tone that mirrors prison life, especially the lives of imprisoned black men who seem to have been consigned by fate and circumstance to incarceration from young ages.</p>

<p>The production under Goins’ direction is at once stark and florid: You feel the numbing sameness of jail life and also sense the enormous complications of the prisoners as they conduct their own bible study; trade in contraband; conspire with guards; pine for connection during severely limited visits from loved ones; try to find privacy; and get into vicious fights. Terri McIntyre’s fight choreography is remarkably real and unhinging.</p>

<p>The play has its faults — the street patois isn’t easy to understand whenever it’s delivered with furious speed, and the play feels indulgently long at two and a half hours. Its plot-driven second half is joltingly different from the first, which focuses more on the issues Goins wants to stress. These include the justice system’s reliance on plea bargaining that results in convictions and bypasses trial by jury; disproportionate sentencing guidelines for minor crimes; people without bail who languish in jail before a trial; and the privately managed prison systems for which prisoners are money. That last issue has been on the radar of two presidents in different ways: Barack Obama’s administration tried to phase private prisons out of the federal system, and Donald Trump’s attorney general has turned that policy around.</p>

<p>“V to X” whets our curiosities about the private prison system through the prison administrator (Steve Connor) who begins the play with our tour of the prison. He comes on stage several times between prison scenes to explain rules and to generally flog privatization as a way of saving taxpayer dollars. Late in the first half, the tour ends, and with it, the conceit that we’re learning about the system. The plot among the various prisoners picks up, and we’re at a different, more traditional play. I found myself wanting more on the subject of privatization, and wondering what makes the prison depicted in the play different from a prison the government operates, besides the corporate shareholders.</p>

<p>Goins stages the show close to the audience, with a row of bunk beds against cinderblock (Dustin Pettigrew’s convincing set) in front of us and a solitary confinement cell behind us. In that cell is the pathetic Bitch Baby (played by Jarron C. Battle), a juvenile awaiting a court date and confined because his family can’t afford bail. Goins modeled that character from Kalief Browder, a New York teenager charged with stealing a backpack and confined for three years of court delays — most of them in solitary. After his release, Browder began studying in college, but the depression that overcame him led to his suicide.</p>

<p>Filling the prison unit are the lifer Wolf (the excellent Monroe Barrick), a new inmate brutally introduced to prison society (George Carver), a recidivist white prisoner (Steve Lunger), a man who’s become a deacon while incarcerated (James Tolbert), and others in a cast that had me convinced I was imprisoned with them. That’s a terrible feeling, but, in this case, just the right one.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>“V to X,” produced by GoKash OnSTAGE, runs through April 15 at Arden Theatre Company’s studio theater at 62 N. Second St., a few doors north of the main Arden theaters on Second Street north of Market Street. 215-922-1122 or ardentheatre.org.</p>

<p>MADISON COUNTY, Miss (WJTV) - The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is looking into the death of a Byram man.</p>

<p>Authorities say the 36-year-old man, Michael Renfroe was shot and killed by a Madison County deputy Friday night on Old Trace Road near Highway 43.</p>

<p>Renfroe's wife says her husband dropped a stick out of the window of his vehicle, then stopped the car to retrieve it. That's when she claims the officer stopped behind them without turning his blue lights on, got out, tazed Renfroe and then shot multiple times.</p>

<p>According to Madison County Sheriff Randy Tucker, there is a tape of the incident which will 'speak for itself'. Tucker says Renfroe physically attacked the deputy.</p>

<p>The Department says it will release the tape after the grand jury rules on the case.</p>

<p>url: https://www.wjtv.com/news/metro/jackson-councilman-proposes-marijuana-fines/945721729 </p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss (WJTV) - </p>

<p>Marijuana is illegal in the State Mississippi. Councilman De'Keither Stamps says he wants to make the punishment better fit the crime,"What we're doing is we're turning users into criminals."</p>

<p>Advocates like Juan Cloy with the Justice Training Institution says a proposed ordinance would allow people to pay a fine in lieu of jail time, "Anybody with possession of marijuana from 30 grams and below will be issued a citation. We're not trying to make this legal, but we have to realize we have to be less punitive for misdemeanor possession of marijuana."</p>

<p>The proposed fine would not be more than $100. Councilman Stamps and supporters say they believe this would free jail space for more serious offenders.</p>

<p>"About 15 percent of the population in Hinds County are non-violent cannabis offenders," said Bud Hemp with the Mississippi Cannabis Coalition. Jennifer Riley-Collins with the ACLU Mississippi agrees, "Collateral consequences that flow from arrests and convictions such as loss jobs, ineligibility for public housing, suspended drivers licenses and restrictions on federal loans can derail lives."</p>

<p>The Councilman is optimistic the policy would free up police to investigate more serious crimes.</p>

<p>"In Jackson, we need our police officers to be focused on major crimes, murder, opiods, and all those types of measures so that we can be more effective in our crime fighting."</p>

<p>The City Council will voted on the proposed ordinance at the next City Council meeting. Similiar policy was adopted in Atlanta late last year.</p>

<p>Jackson, Miss. (WJTV) - If passed and signed, House Bill 1100 would require a moment of quiet reflection in public school classrooms across the state. It would also mandate that the 10 Commandments be read aloud and displayed.</p>

<p>Rep. Credell Calhoun authored the bill, “As you know, we have far too many killings in our community and mass shootings, all of those things. And we understand that those people that are doing it were once children so maybe it will help.”</p>

<p>The ACLU of Mississippi says the bill would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>

<p>“We understand that people are very, very passionate about their beliefs," says Aisha Carson, ACLU Advocacy Coordinator. "That’s one of the things that makes America great but what we absolutely don’t want to happen and what we also understand makes America great is people having the right to express their religion and not having a religion imposed on them.”</p>

<p>Calhoun says, “We understand that not everyone wants it but my constituent wanted to file it and we filed it.”</p>

<p>House Bill 1100 is being reviewed by the Education committee and must make it out of committee January 30 to be considered on the floor.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi released a report about police and body cameras.</p>

<p>The report recommends a statewide policy meant to standardize the use of police body-worn cameras.</p>

<p>"For body cameras to promote trust between police and the community, police must use them in a way that carefully balances interests in police accountability, government transparency, and privacy. In the policies we analyzed, we found inconsistent implementation guidance, a lack of privacy safeguards, and bare minimum accountability provisions," said Blake Feldman, ACLU of MS Criminal Justice Reform Advocacy Coordinator, and primary researcher and author of the report.</p>

<p>The report evaluated the use of body cameras. They said out of the 65 law enforcement policies reviewed, zero require individuals to be notified that they are being recorded; less than 20% require officers deactivate the camera when entering a home if the resident requests the camera be turned off; no policies provide provisions to protect victims of domestic violence; and most do not lift the activation of the cameras in school settings.</p>

<p>HARRISON COUNTY, MS (WLOX) -</p>

<p>A deputy has been fired from the Harrison County Sheriff's Department after he was found to have violated department policies and procedures, officials say.</p>

<p>The termination was announced after the Sheriff's Department held an administrative hearing on Thursday, April 26.</p>

<p>Previously, the deputy was placed on administrative leave after a controversial video surfaced on Facebook and the Sheriff's Department received complaints of alleged excessive force by law enforcement.</p>

<p>An internal investigation was launched on Tuesday, April 24. It revealed that the inmate was removed from one jail transport van and placed into another van after causing a disruption with other inmates. Reports say an argument sparked between a deputy and the inmate while the move was taking place.</p>

<p>As noted in the official statement by the Harrison County Sheriff's Department,"The deputy was required to use force to place the inmate in the transport vehicle to return him to the Harrison County Adult Detention Center."</p>

<p>On Monday, a 15-second video was uploaded to social media, showing the inmate jumping onto the bumper and leaning back before one of the deputies pushed him into the van. Sheriff Troy Peterson said security video from the courthouse was also reviewed as part of the investigation.</p>

<p>BILOXI, MS (WLOX) -</p>

<p>The ACLU’s Liberty Lobbyist training program came to Biloxi and gave a special lesson to advocates of change.</p>

<p>The program is designed to show those who wish to be a voice for change how to be more effective and get their messages across to state lawmakers.</p>

<p>Four people came to the session.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t concern me because all it takes is one person,” said Zakiya Summers with the ACLU Mississippi. “In fact, we hope that folks who do come to the training will take the information they gather today and share that with folks that are around them.”</p>

<p>The big lesson: Learn who your legislators are, connect with them and be prepared.</p>

<p>“We can’t sit back at home and expect these individuals to do what we want them to do,” he said. “We have to let them know what we want them to do and we have to do it in a way that’s going to bring the kind of change they want to see.”</p>

<p>So far, this is the third training session for this new program that will be taken all over the state.</p>

<p>On this day, teenagers had the floor.</p>

<p>“We are the next generation. We’re going to be the next leaders,” said Pascagoula High School student Brittney Kenyatta Thomas. “I think that our voice is extremely important and vital to the conversation about anything having to do with our education.”</p>

<p>Thomas, a member of the Mississippi Youth Council that supports the teaching of comprehensive sex education, wanted to apply what she learned at the session to help her organization.</p>

<p>“We have to advocate to legislators and talk to them and try to convince them to support us, and so I came here because I want to learn more about how to do that,” she said. “I want to be able to connect with them and to be able to see things from our side and why we’re advocating for this.”</p>

<p>Her classmate, Quinton Harry, has been doing a lot of lobbyist training.</p>

<p>He believes that even a small turnout can make a big difference.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel alone,” he said. “I know that people are out there. It’s just that in Mississippi, it’s hard rallying those voices together. Here, we really have to work harder and get those people to show up and grow. But the only way we can do that is for the few of us who do speak out, speak out louder.”</p>

<p>The ACLU of Mississippi will have a Legislative Advocacy Day on Jan. 23.</p>

<p>Among the biggest agenda items for this legislative session is to push for a statewide policy for the use of body cameras by police.</p>

<p>url: http://www.wtva.com/content/news/Local-police-respond-to-street-gang-threat-assessment--471185563.html </p>

<p>TUPELO, Miss. (WTVA) - Police departments in Tupelo and Corinth responded to a recent study on the threat of street gangs released this week.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Analysis and Information Center details that there are gangs in every single county in the state.</p>

<p>Some may say gang presence has been downplayed in the past, but three main ones are present in our area according to Homeland Security.</p>

<p>“We’re very fortunate that we don’t have a gang problem, but at the same time to deny that we don’t have gang activity would be an error,”said Major Anthony Hill with the Tupelo Police Department's Special Operations.</p>

<p>The recent street gang assessment says in Lee County the top three gangs are the Gangster Disciples, Vice Lords and Simon City Royals.</p>

<p>“Burglaries, robbery, vehicle theft, but it’s not a problematic situation where we don’t have control over it,” commented Hill.</p>

<p>The investigator says in Tupelo, they’ve found that gangs aren't concerned with territory but primarily with making profit.</p>

<p>In Corinth it’s a different story.</p>

<p>Police Chief Ralph Dance strongly agrees gangs are a problem. Back in 2015, two young men died to violence, all because of two rival gangs, the Black Gangster Disciples and Vice Lords.</p>

<p>About 80 rounds were fired, ending the lives of Ahmarus Swinney and Deonta Herman.</p>

<p>Major Hill says loyalties between gangs can become blurred.</p>

<p>“You may see two gangs that are traditionally against each other come together. Doesn’t matter what sect you’re from, we’re about making money.”</p>

<p>Investigators say there are neighborhood cliques in the area and that kids want to mock what they see on tv and social media with gangs, not knowing the consequences.</p>

<p>They recommend the best plan of action is communication between the police and community.</p>

<p>MGN Online</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (WTVA) – A report from the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi (ACLU) calls for a statewide policy to standardize the use of police body-worn cameras.</p>

<p>The organization released its report Monday, which “highlights the lack of uniformity in the way law enforcement agencies across the state deploy body-worn cameras.</p>

<p>“The report found key gaps in policies across the state. Of the 65 law enforcement policies reviewed, zero require individuals to be notified that they are being recorded; less than 20% require officers deactivate the camera when entering a home if the resident requests the camera be turned off; no policies provide provisions to protect victims of domestic violence; and most do not lift the activation of BWCs in school settings,” stated ACLU.</p>

<p>The organization says it is hopeful Mississippi lawmakers will consider the data the report shows.</p>

<p>“Used properly, body-worn video cameras can help deter police misconduct and uses of force, provide evidence to hold officers accountable when misconduct does occur as well as exonerate wrongly accused officers, and help the public understand how police operate. The lack of uniformity across the state makes it clear that the state must establish certain minimum criteria for policies governing the use of BWCs by agencies choosing to deploy them,” said Jennifer Riley Collins, ACLU of Mississippi Executive Director.</p>

<p>TUPELO, Miss. (WTVA) - Video on Facebook shows two security officers with the Mall at Barnes Crossing wrestling a teenager to the ground, arresting him, then dragging him inside the mall as a crowd of teens watched.</p>

<p>Late Friday night, Tupelo police responded to the mall for what was described as a "large group of juveniles."</p>

<p>Police say mall security made the call.</p>

<p>The viral video shows security refusing to let the teens into the mall after closing hours. Then one teenager walked up to a security officer standing in one of the entrances to the food court. When the teen approached in what appeared to be a threatening manner, the confrontation escalated with shoving between the two and the second officer grabbing the teen from behind.</p>

<p>Other security officers could be seen on the video trying to keep people away as the teen was being arrested.</p>

<p>According to Lee County Sheriff's Department records, 18-year-old Drew Smith was arrested and charged with three counts of failing to comply, all considered misdeamenors. A judge set bond at $3,200.</p>

<p>The sheriff's department said Tupelo police was the arresting agency and mall security is the charging agency.</p>

<p>At this time, we know one female hurt her leg during all of this.</p>

<p>Tupelo police say they do not know how the injury happened.</p>

<p>That female was not taken to the hospital, but she did wait in an ambulance until her parents arrived.</p>

<p>Tupelo police and the mayor's office are referring questions related to Friday night's incident at the Mall at Barnes Crossing to mall security for details.</p>

<p>Sheriff Jim Johnson says he has been made aware by the public of threats made on social media in reaction to this incident. He says it is his job to keep everyone safe and he will not tolerate threats.</p>

<h2 id="justiceforallinthelandofthefree">Justice for all in the land of the free?</h2>

<p>In the US criminal justice system, there is a fate far worse than being sentenced to death.</p>

<p>David A Love &amp; Vijay Das (Dec. 10, 2017)</p>

<p>A global outlier in criminal justice, the US undermines itself on the world stage when it engages in human rights abuses against its prisoners, write Love and Das [Reuters]</p>

<p>On this day 69 years ago the United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, sketching the foundation of human rights law. Led by Eleanor Roosevelt, the United States played a critical role in bringing 48 nations together to enumerate a set of core individual rights and freedoms that we all reference to this day.</p>

<p>Unfortunately today the US struggles to live up to these ideals it helped create. <mark>The punitive nature of American criminal justice deserves international censure.</mark> The US has emerged as the global capital of mass incarceration, and its sentencing laws must be examined.</p>

<p>Although it calls itself the "land of the free," the US maintains a draconian sentencing scheme, sending more people to prison than any other nation. While it touts its own human rights record and lectures other nations on their human rights shortcomings, its voracious appetite for life sentences without parole is an embarrassment that fails to live up to the lofty rhetoric of the US Constitution, and falls far short of international standards.</p>

<p>The sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, or LWOP, is just as the term implies. A person will remain behind bars for the rest of his or her life and until death, without any hope of release from prison. A cruel form of punishment often referred to as "the other death penalty," LWOP violates international human rights norms.</p>

<p><strong>Violating human dignity</strong></p>

<p>William W. Berry III of the University of Mississippi noted, human rights law is based on the concept of human dignity (pdf). Both the preamble of the Charter of the UN, and Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reinforce this concept.</p>

<p>Similarly, the US Supreme Court has said the basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution - which prohibits "cruel and unusual punishments" - is nothing less than the dignity of man. While the State has the power to punish, the Amendment stands to assure that this power is exercised within the limits of civilised standards. As Berry notes, LWOP - as a "one-time decision" and "death-in-custody sentence" - violates the human dignity of the condemned (pdf), the high court's decisions notwithstanding. A final and total condemnation of a person, LWOP sentencing is problematic because there is no way of knowing if there is proportionality in the sentence, it does not allow for rehabilitation and does not account for changes in the offender's danger to society over time.</p>

<p>According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the goal of the treatment of prisoners is reformation and social rehabilitation: "Life-sentence prisoners should be eligible for release into society once they have served a sufficient period of time in custody to mark the seriousness of their offences (pdf)".</p>

<p>The imposition of LWOP in the US is a violation of a number of UN human rights conventions, of which the country is a signatory, but often neglects to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Racial discrimination in sentencing</strong></p>

<p>For example, racial and ethnic minorities disproportionately receive LWOP sentences (pdf), a violation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), or the Race Convention. While African Americans are 13 percent of the population, they were 28.3 percent of prisoners serving life sentences as of 2009, 56.4 percent of those sentenced to LWOP, and 56.1 percent of juveniles serving LWOP (JLWOP), according to the ACLU (pdf).</p>

<p>Juan Mendez, the UN special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, noted the US is the only country to continue the practice of JLWOP. Many lifers serve their sentences in solitary confinement - isolation for at least 22 hours a day - which is a form of torture (pdf) under the UN Torture Convention.</p>

<p>The explosion of people doing time for life has been more about locking up black and brown bodies than deterring crime.
The European Court of Human Rights has found that life sentences with no hope of release raise issues under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The court ruled that a whole life sentence must allow for reducibility (pdf) if a prisoner has been rehabilitated and continued detention is no longer justifiable.</p>

<p>In practice, more than 50,000 prisoners are serving life without parole today. That's one in every 28 prisoners. One quarter of those serving life or virtual life sentences will never have an opportunity for parole.</p>

<p>Most doing life without parole were convicted of violent crimes. Others were not. There are more than 3,000 nonviolent LWOP offenders as young as eighteen. Offenses like stealing a $159 jacket or selling cannabis are costing lives. Sixty-five percent of these nonviolent offenders are African American. In nine states, African Americans make up two-thirds of those serving life without parole.</p>

<p>The surge in life without parole sentencing is staggering. LWOP rolls quadrupled nationwide from 1992 to 2012, from 12,453 to 49,081(pdf). That rate of growth is almost four times the percentage rise in people serving parole-eligible sentences.</p>

<p>The explosion of people doing time for life has been more about locking up black and brown bodies than deterring crime. Violent crime has been on the decline for decades, yet in states such as California, Florida, and Virginia LWOP prison populations exploded since 2003. California's violent crime decreased by 26.4 percent yet their LWOP count grew by 281.6 percent. California has made progress reversing its tough-on-crime past, yet they've thrown the book and then some for many of their prisoners to this day. </p>

<p>Finally, despite progress being made in the area of juvenile justice, the US is still an outlier. In 2012, the US Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama it's unconstitutional to sentence kids for life without parole. Today, however, approximately 2,100 people remain in prison for crimes they committed as children.</p>

<p>To give up on rehabilitating individuals attacks a core tenet of criminal justice in a functioning democracy.
Even in the aftermath of the US Supreme Court halting harsh sentencing of minors, the US continues to wrestle with the impacts of degrading sentencing. Legislators and prosecutors for too long have cast Black and Latino American children as young as 14 as irredeemable super-predators, charging, prosecuting, convicting and sentencing children as if they were adults. Most of these children, of course, sprung out of traumatic environments, poor mental health access and sometimes abusive households. </p>

<p>Many LWOP offenders grew out of over-policed under-resourced communities hollowed-out after years of divestment and systematic discrimination to access decent housing, education and employment. To give up on rehabilitating individuals attacks a core tenet of criminal justice in a functioning democracy. The system should not simply punish but be a place for mercy and change, a set of rules for offenders to reflect, repair and heal.</p>

<p>A global outlier in criminal justice, the US undermines itself on the world stage when it engages in human rights abuses against its prisoners. The nation will remain ill-equipped to serve as a human rights leader and role model as long as it ignores international standards regarding life sentences. The US must do much better, which means implementing sentencing laws that uphold human dignity and facilitate rehabilitation, rather than encouraging punitive measures that embrace cruelty and retribution for its own sake.</p>

<h1 id="extinguishingthebeaconofamerica">Extinguishing the Beacon of America</h1>

<p>The Trump administration’s policy of separating families is designed to erase hope—with devastating consequences for thousands of children.</p>

<p>Alex Wagner, The Atlantic, Jun. 15, 2018 <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/extinguishing-the-beacon-of-america/562880/">:link:</a></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2018/06/RTX682PA/lead_720_405.jpg?mod=1529031622" alt="img" /></p>

<p>Patrick Fallon / Reuters</p>

<p>In early May, I traveled to McAllen, Texas, to speak with U.S. Border Patrol about the  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/06/trump-cant-disown-his-immigration-policies-now/562097/">current immigration crisis</a> . It was a humid, overcast morning and Chris Cabrera, the agency’s spokesperson, stood on the banks of the Rio Grande as he explained the challenges posed by the current wave of migrants entering the country illegally, most of whom are refugees fleeing deadly violence and institutional failure in Central America. “You have a lot of women and children that are coming here. I’ve seen groups of 20, 25 people that are all women, or all girls, age 15 and below.”</p>

<p>Cabrera was anguished about the surge in illegal entries. “We have this beacon that says you can come in, and we will take you, right?” he said. “So what does that do? That activates people.”</p>

<p>Throughout our conversation, Cabrera returned to what he called “the beacon”—in this case, the promise of freedom that was luring children and their families across the border. “When you find an 11-year-old in the brush, dead, alone, and you could see that he’s got his little Pokemon belt on, it breaks your heart,” he said. “At what point do we turn off this beacon?”</p>

<p>But that beacon is the idea of America—the promise of a better life, of freedom from persecution. How might anyone possibly extinguish the idea of America?</p>

<p>The Trump administration seems to have come up with its answer in the current “zero tolerance” policy for migrant families, one that appears to be based in deterrence. Practically, this means that, for the families making the dangerous journey to the U.S. border, what awaits them is not respite, but trauma: the separation of families and the potential deportation of parents without their children. It is a clarion call to those considering migration north—here, in America, we will take your children. And you may not see them again  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/us/immigrant-children-separation-ice.html">for a very long time</a> . This, apparently, is how you turn off the idea of America: take the dreams of a better life in this country, and turn them into nightmares.</p>

<p>As a means of deterrence, the policy has failed: Illegal crossings in March saw a  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-border-20180405-story.html">fourfold increase</a>  since the same time last year. For the families—especially the children—who have already been torn apart in the process, and for whom deterrence is a ship long since sailed, the effects of this policy are profound and deeply disturbing.  <a href="http://www.terrafirma.nyc/">Alan Shapiro</a> , the senior medical director for community pediatric programs at Montefiore Health System, put it bluntly: “This is government-sanctioned torture of children.”</p>

<p>To understand the breadth of this suffering, I spoke with several experts who work with migrant children from Central American countries, including Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Each made a point of highlighting the trauma visited upon these children even before they reach the border of the United States.</p>

<p>“They have come from a place where they have been exposed to incredible turmoil and sometimes very severe trauma—whether the killing of one parent or family member, domestic violence, plus abject poverty,” said Shapiro. “There is a lack of food, poor living conditions, dangerous neighborhoods—all of that is the baseline of the children we are seeing. It’s critical to understand that these are not people looking for a better life, they are looking to flee dangerous environments with no protection.”</p>

<p>On Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/11/us/politics/sessions-domestic-violence-asylum.html">declared</a>  that domestic abuse and gang violence do not constitute grounds for asylum, thereby making it nearly impossible for many of these Central American migrants to claim legal grounds for staying in the United States. “The asylum statute does not provide redress for all misfortune,” Sessions  <a href="https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1070866/download">wrote in his ruling</a> . Quoting an earlier decision, Sessions downplayed the severity of the situation in places like Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. “Evidence consistent with acts of private violence or that merely shows that an individual has been the victim of criminal activity does not constitute evidence of persecution on a statutorily protected ground.”</p>

<p>Characterizing asylum seekers as “merely” the victims of criminal activity is telling, a rhetorical waving-off of troubles by the nation’s highest law-enforcement officer. Donna Abbott, the branch director of refugee services for Bethany Christian Services (which places unaccompanied migrant children in foster care), sees it differently. “The terminology is different, but just because it’s called a gang doesn’t mean it’s not a terrorist group,” she told me. “They recruit children, they use threats of violence, and they terrify communities and the most vulnerable populations.”</p>

<p>Sessions’s downgrade of this horror to a “private violence” reflects the administration’s hands-off attitude toward the collapse under way in the Central American triangle—but it is also evidence of the government’s fundamental miscalculation. Until President Trump and his associates begin to grapple with the severity of the situation in these countries, their efforts to stanch the flow of refugees through deterrence will be futile: The terrors at home (as yet) still outweigh the trauma that awaits.</p>

<p>But that is not to understate the severity of the damage the United States government has chosen to inflict on migrant children. Pediatric experts I spoke with described the voyage to America as yet another chapter in a profoundly disruptive experience. The children arrive at the border stressed and seeking stability. Instead, they find trauma piled on top of suffering, as a matter of policy.</p>

<p>“Stability is very important for a child’s life,” Shapiro said. “Going to bed at the same time, having meals at the same time, seeing the same people—it helps children’s own physiology stabilize. But if it’s constant change, their physiology is responding by releasing the stress hormone. Then they take the journey—they ride on the top of trains, in the back of trucks, they are exposed to extremes in weather and temperature, there is a lack of food. [This is] ongoing trauma—so in a child already sensitized, it’s ratcheting up the level of stress.”</p>

<p>This continued erosion of emotional health puts migrant children in a weakened state well before the Department of Homeland Security chooses to take the child away from his or her parents. “At the border, the family for the first time senses protection,” said Shapiro. “To have them ripped apart is adding a level of stress that most of us are finding hard to reconcile.”</p>

<p>“Any child that has gone through a traumatic event, the first thing they want is to be assured that their world is safe, that the adults caring for them have their best interests at heart. That’s the parents, right?,” Abbott said. “But you separate them from that—even though we are doing the best we can—and the child has to learn all over again: Is this person safe?”</p>

<p>“The ultimate stressor—the ultimate trauma—is being removed from your loving caregiver. On top of that, the child is losing the person who is supposed to buffer that stress,” Shapiro said. “Who are they to turn to, to give them that comfort?”</p>

<p>It is hard to overstate the challenge this presents, especially when one factors in the age of the children in question. One of the more sinister effects of the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance position is that the average age of the children who are being rendered “unaccompanied” (by virtue of the separation policy) has plummeted. According to Abbott, “The age range has been usually a little older. But now with the separations, we’re seeing day-care, toddler age. Children as young as eight months old.”</p>

<p>Wendy Young, the CEO of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND)—which assists migrant children with legal representation—told me, “The family-separation policy has particularly targeted the little ones. The youngest we’ve seen is an 11-month-old.”</p>

<p>The developmental implications for children at such tender ages are dire. “This is when the most rapid brain growth is happening,” Julie Linton, a co-chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Immigrant Health Special Interest Group, told me. “The traumatizing is really impeding children and their ability to contribute to the world.”</p>

<p>“The most alarming cases have been with really young children,” she said. “We’ve seen changes in bodily functions, sleeping, eating, and toileting.”</p>

<p>Children may start to wet themselves or lose bowel control, or engage in “self-injurious behavior,” Shapiro said.</p>

<p>“They are detached. Numb. Aggressive. Anxious,” Linton said. “They have exaggerated responses, like door slamming. There are changes in learning, there are temper tantrums and limited working memory.”</p>

<p>Separated children are often in shock. But there are also internal changes, ones that are less visible but no less distressing. “Physiologically, we are damaging the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems,” Shapiro said. “All these things with prolonged stress without a buffer lead to long-term chronic diseases: cancer, depression, obesity, worsening asthma.”</p>

<p>And then there is the impact on mental development. “We are putting children in a constant fight-or-flight mode,” Shapiro said. “It shuts down their memory centers and is potentially affecting their long-term learning and development. I almost have never seen this.”</p>

<p>While heroic efforts are under way—by advocates, aid workers, and nonprofit groups—to mitigate the effects of this state-directed trauma, the sheer magnitude of the demand is compromising the efficacy of that work. After being taken from their parents, many children end up in large detention centers—in some cases, little more than  <a href="http://thehill.com/latino/392200-msnbc-reporter-detained-immigrant-children-are-effectively-incarcerated">warehouses</a> —which are increasingly overcrowded, due to the surge in demand. According to the director of one nonprofit group that assists migrant children (who asked to remain anonymous), these facilities—housing as many as 1,500 children of tender ages—are far too large and ill-equipped to deal with children who are grappling with severely traumatic experiences. In America’s domestic child-services management, the director explained, “we stopped doing that decades ago—putting kids in large facilities. And now we’re going in the opposite direction.”</p>

<p>With numbers like these, the ratio of adult caregivers and clinicians to children has grown alarmingly low, complicating efforts to reach and rehabilitate the most vulnerable. (It has also compromised the ability to assist children in finding their parents before they are deported—an increasingly time-sensitive proposition, given the Trump administration’s policy of  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/opinion/boumediene-rule-of-law-border.html">expedited removal</a> .)</p>

<p>The complications facing even the most seasoned advocates would be farcical, if they weren’t so grim. “We now have the huge challenge of representing babies,” Young said of her organization’s legal advocacy. “How do you represent babies? How do you represent toddlers? It’s extremely challenging.”</p>

<p>I asked her whether the children even realized what was happening, as they were forced to navigate the thicket of government groups—from DHS to HHS to the state courts—in a bid to find home. “Generally not,” Young said. “They are very, very confused. It’s not unusual when the attorney briefs a child—and rebriefs the child—that you get questions like ‘When we get to court, do you walk in first, or do I walk in first?’ No matter where they are from, children have certain steps in their development and a certain capacity to understand … We just have to support them.” She added, “We’ve reached a new low point.”</p>

<p>I asked the same of Abbott: How are foster parents grappling with such young children who have been through so much? “We’re hearing from foster parents about how difficult it is to hear a child cry half the night for Mama or Papa—or who doesn’t understand where their parent is.”</p>

<p>Her organization, which has contracts with the federal government, has been reluctant to wade into the politics of immigration, but Abbot was clear in her assessment of separating migrant children from their parents. “This is still a developing process,” she said, “but what we do know is that it’s just plain wrong to separate children for seeking safety. From the parents’ perspective, from Bethany’s perspective, this makes no sense.”</p>

<p>The ACLU is  <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-aclu-judge-border-families-lawsuit-20180504-story.html">suing to end the practice of family separations</a> , and a ruling is expected soon on a preliminary injunction. Lee Gelernt, the ACLU attorney handling the suit, told me that while the government is not arguing that the basis of the policy lies in deterrence (the administration instead contends that children must be separated from their parents as a matter of criminal prosecution), the extended separation of children from their families is “purposeful.”</p>

<p>“This is not neglect or incompetence,” he said. “This is a practice and a policy.”</p>

<p>It is hard to imagine otherwise. After speaking with these aid workers and doctors and lawyers, I thought back to that day on the banks of the Rio Grande, and I remembered how impossible Cabrera’s proposition seemed, this notion that you could somehow extinguish the idea of America—its hope, its freedom, its fairness. The treatment and repeated traumatization of migrant children is a test of that hypothesis: Perhaps those ideals are not as immutable as we might have imagined.</p>

<h1 id="afteranincreaseinicearrestsneworleansimmigrantsorganizeagainstmasssurveillance">After an increase in ICE arrests, New Orleans immigrants organize against mass surveillance</h1>

<p>Alex Woodward (mar. 5, 2018)</p>

<p>url: https://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/after-an-increase-in-ice-arrests-new-orleans-immigrants-organize-against-mass-surveillance/Content?oid=10731803</p>

<p><strong>A few steps from the doors to New Orleans City Hall</strong> Feb. 23, children took turns thrashing a colorful pinata shaped like an oversized surveillance camera. Surrounding the entrance were cartoonlike effigies of cameras, mocking a proposed plan requiring cameras outside nearly every bar and restaurant that could stream to law enforcement, joining a growing network of newly installed surveillance cameras throughout New Orleans.</p>

<p>After a few minutes, the pinata broke open. Candy poured out.</p>

<p>Immigrants, their families and advocates routinely protest outside the doors of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Massive crowds outside City Hall also have rallied against a series of executive orders from President Donald Trump on immigration. Now those fights against a new administration are meeting a creeping parallel within local government.</p>

<p>Immigrant advocacy organizations are joining a growing opposition to <a href="https://www.bestofneworleans.com/gambit/new-orleans-you-are-being-watched/Content?oid=9498736">a $40 million public safety plan</a> proposed by the city, part of which would stream video from cameras installed throughout the city into a central nervous system at the newly launched Real Time Crime Monitoring Center, which shares feeds with the city's Department of Homeland Security, the Louisiana State Police, the FBI and other "law enforcement partners," as well as the data storage companies that ultimately will be responsible for the footage.</p>

<p>New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) officials say the surveillance network won't be used for immigration enforcement; NOPD Superintendent Michael Harrison has stressed the department's role in building trust with immigrant communities to prevent crimes from going un- or under-reported, and the NOPD's federal consent decree with the U.S. Department of Justice strengthens anti-bias and anti-profiling protections within the department.</p>

<p>But there's fear among immigrant communities that it won't be enough to keep ICE out of New Orleans.</p>

<p>"Our fear is based in real-life situations that happen every day," says Jose Torres, who has lived in New Orleans for nearly 13 years after fleeing El Salvador. "Police do not collaborate directly with ICE, but we're very concerned with this camera situation. Will ICE have access to this? These are private companies. What control do we have over that? While it's a fear right now, it's a well-founded fear."</p>

<p><img src="https://media2.fdncms.com/gambit/imager/u/original/10731800/coverstory-2.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p><strong>ICE agents from the New Orleans field office made 7,968 arrests</strong> (5,059 for "criminal" offenses) in the last fiscal year, a 65 percent increase in arrests from 2016, when there were 5,174 arrests. During that same time from 2017, ICE deported 9,471 people from the region.</p>

<p>ICE's arrests throughout the U.S. reached more than 143,470 in 2017, which saw a surge in arrests following Trump's inauguration. ICE made 110,568 arrests between Jan. 20 and Sept. 30.</p>

<p>The New Orleans office, which includes Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana, peaked in 2011 with 12,895 arrests, but arrests began to dip sharply in the following years, reflecting a national trend after President Barack Obama's administration issued a mandate that deprioritized some immigration cases and focused on people involved in more serious crimes. Last year, however, the number of arrests spiked for the first time since 2010.</p>

<p>Whether or not New Orleans' camera network will be used by the feds, the further expansion of a surveillance network into lower-income neighborhoods in a city largely populated by people of color has increased fear and speculation among residents in those communities, who see cameras as adding insult to injury as crime persists in their neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Immigrant advocacy group Congress of Day Laborers, an arm of the New Orleans Workers' Center for Racial Justice, fears camera footage could wind up in the hands of ICE, either as a "law enforcement partner" under the policing umbrella, or as a buyer scooping up footage from the company storing it.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of reasons our communities are living in fear," says Santos Canales with the Congress of Day Laborers. "We've all seen a wave of racism and discrimination arise since the election. It's very open, so much so that our community doesn't feel safe anywhere. We feel like we always have to be watching our back, that there may be somebody watching us differently, keeping eyes on us, looking for any reason to implicate us for things we didn't have anything to do with."</p>

<p>Despite assurances from NOPD, ICE already appears to be looking into local technology to track immigrant communities.</p>

<p>A story first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17054740/palantir-predictive-policing-tool-new-orleans-nopd">published by The Verge</a> last month revealed how Peter Thiel's Silicon Valley data services company Palantir Technology has worked alongside City Hall and local law enforcement since 2012 using its "predictive policing" software to identify people who could be involved with or victims of gun violence. Palantir also has a contract with ICE to build out a platform that allows ICE to search government databases to gather personal information. The Department of Homeland Security also is able to search social media accounts linked to people who have interacted with immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>In January, ICE entered into a contract with West Publishing and Vigilant Solutions to allow the agency to search national license plate reader databases. That information would allow ICE not only to search for addresses attached to license plates but also track where those vehicles have routinely traveled — at work, a doctor's office — to map drivers' footprints and the people and places to which they're associated.</p>

<p>NOPD recently purchased 22 license plate readers and will bring another 80 online in the coming months. Those cameras also will stream into the Real Time Crime Monitoring Center, along with footage from cameras installed in crime "hotspots" throughout the city and — if the New Orleans City Council votes in support of a proposed plan this month — cameras installed outside every business that sells alcohol, creating one of the largest surveillance networks in the U.S.</p>

<p>Canales has lived in New Orleans for more than a decade after fleeing Honduras, which endured escalating political violence leading up to and following a 2009 coup. He's able to live in the U.S. with a temporary protected status designation, but he fears the Trump administration's realignment of immigration enforcement could dissolve his stability at any moment.</p>

<p>"We're all at risk right now," he says. "I've always felt good in this city. We've really gotten accustomed to it. We've become a part of life here. We work here, we pay taxes here‚ this is our home. I feel part of this city. I feel part of this community. ... But the smallest error, the smallest mistake, you could fall out of the good graces and be deported. For many of us there's no guarantee we could return, not to mention the conditions we could face while we're there."</p>

<p>Rachel Taber, an organizer with Congress of Day Laborers, says cameras could end up penalizing people living in high-crime neighborhoods by them being profiled by law enforcement.</p>

<p>The group is calling on the City Council to invest in initiatives that strengthen families and improve access to jobs, "not more incarceration and criminalization," Taber says.</p>

<p>Canales says unless there's a written policy affirming that local policies against racial profiling will extend to the companies and agencies responsible for the cameras, the city can't guarantee it's surveilling its residents equally. And without law enforcement's trust in the communities it serves, Canales says people aren't likely to report crimes they've witnessed if they continue to fear for their own safety from police.</p>

<p>"You're not seeing the same level of surveillance around Tulane University or Loyola University," he says. "Perhaps law enforcement believes some demographics are more liable to commit crime, but we know everybody is equal."</p>

<p><img src="https://media2.fdncms.com/gambit/imager/u/original/10731801/coverstory-3.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p><strong>When he was 18 years old, Jose Torres made the</strong> <strong>long, difficult journey</strong> through Mexico and across the Rio Grande after fleeing violence in El Salvador. He was detained in the U.S., briefly, then forced into labor at a Texas ranch, where his employer threatened to report Torres to police if he left. He escaped to New Orleans in 2005, where he worked among day laborers and construction workers to rebuild homes following Hurricane Katrina and the levee failures.</p>

<p>Immigration authorities caught up with Torres in 2013 after he was charged with a DUI. He received probation, paid fines and completed community service and substance abuse counseling. He ultimately was granted a stay of deportation to remain with his family, including his wife and two young daughters, but he knew it was only a matter of time before he would be told to leave the country.</p>

<p>On Nov. 15, 2017, Torres was scheduled to appear for a check-in appointment at the New Orleans ICE office, which would hand him a ticket to "self-deport." Instead, standing on the steps of First Grace United Methodist Church in Mid-City that morning, Torres announced that the church offered him sanctuary.</p>

<p>First Grace — which also provides meeting space for the Congress of Day Laborers — gave Torres "some degree of safety" by opening its doors that, the community hopes, will keep out law enforcement, Pastor Shawn Anglim told <em>Gambit</em>.</p>

<p>"You remember that you were once in that place, you were once treated as a foreigner, as strange, as a stranger," Anglim said. "Being a human being means providing a space for people who once felt that way. The word 'sanctuary' is to harbor, to protect, and that's what we're doing here for Jose."</p>

<p>Four months later, Torres sits with his hands clasped on a table inside a small office at First Grace, where he continues to live.</p>

<p>"No parent wants to be in those shoes or in that situation, where you're separated from your children," Torres says. "Children are what motivate us to wake up every morning and keep working and move forward with your lives. Having an order of deportation or being deported, it's horrible."</p>

<p>The debate over New Orleans' role as a "sanctuary" city for people living in the country illegally has reached the state attorney general's office, the U.S. Congress and the White House.</p>

<p>Mayor Mitch Landrieu has adamantly refused defining New Orleans as a "sanctuary" city, pointing to policies with the NOPD that allow communication between the police and ICE.</p>

<p>In January, Landrieu, who also serves as the president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, canceled a meeting with U.S. mayors and Trump, whose administration issued another round of warnings to two dozen jurisdictions that the Justice Department warned are in jeopardy of losing certain funding if they can't prove cooperation with immigration enforcement. In a statement, Landrieu said Trump's "decision to threaten mayors and demonize immigrants yet again — and use cities as political props in the process — has made this meeting untenable."</p>

<p>Though New Orleans isn't designated a "sanctuary" city, Landrieu has come forward in the defense of cities who have fought against federal intervention into immigrant communities seeking sanctuary status.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, state Attorney General Jeff Landry has emerged as his fierce opponent: Landry wants an appeals court to overturn a ruling that effectively blocks Trump's "sanctuary" order after a federal judge declared it unconstitutional in 2017. Landry also has butted heads with Landrieu and state lawmakers over Landry's support for a local measure that aims to strip funding to cities he believes harbor people living in the country illegally.</p>

<p>But statewide law enforcement largely agrees its hands are tied when it comes to enforcing federal law — while Landry and ICE see them as local arms of immigration enforcement, local police see it as a strain on their own limited resources.</p>

<p>At a Feb. 26 forum, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joe Lopinto said his office won't stop "ICE holds," the practice of local and state police detaining people suspected of living in the country illegally on behalf of ICE when they enter local custody — but like his predecessor Newell Normand, he's pushed against efforts from state lawmakers (and Landry) that pressure local cops to ban "sanctuary" policies or risk losing certain funding. Lopinto — currently in a race against John Fortunato in a March election for parish sheriff — says he's "not at a point to enter the parish into a sanctuary city where we don't cooperate."</p>

<p>"If that costs me a vote, so be it," he said. "I'd much rather be housing a person that is an actual criminal than housing someone who is just undocumented. That's a federal issue that has to work itself out, and it's not fair for me or my opponent to try and solve a federal issue we can't solve locally."</p>

<p><img src="https://media1.fdncms.com/gambit/imager/u/original/10731802/coverstory-infographic.jpg" alt="img" /></p>

<p><strong>Torres fears his deportation would break his family apart.</strong> With two daughters, one of whom suffers chronic health issues, Torres previously could've relied on prosecutorial discretion to allow him to remain with them in the U.S. Now, he says, "It almost doesn't matter what your story is."</p>

<p>"None of that matters to Immigration," Torres says. "I could be pursued by Immigration at any time. It's very hard as a father."</p>

<p>Torres says additional surveillance measures ultimately will lead to more families being separated.</p>

<p>"When a child suffers that kind of trauma, if we're talking about crime prevention, we need to look at the roots," Canales says.</p>

<p>In September, the Orleans Parish School Board (OPSB) agreed to new guidelines aimed at limiting law enforcement interaction and intimidation on campuses. The policies provide a set of instructions for school administrators when police — including ICE agents — enter a school, including asking for a warrant seeking student data or access to the student and making "every reasonable effort" to notify the student's parent or guardian before police can see them.</p>

<p>"School should be a safe place for all children," OPSB Superintendent Henderson Lewis Jr. said in a statement. "The Orleans Parish School Board holds this as a basic principle."</p>

<p>Though the policy change applies only to schools run directly by OPSB, it was a triumph for family advocacy group Nuestra Voz, which led a campaign among parents, teachers and other community members to get the issue on the OPSB's agenda. Nuestra Voz also is campaigning to get a similar policy into Jefferson Parish schools.</p>

<p>What began as a protection for immigrant students has expanded the organization's reach to support black families and students, which Nuestra Voz director Mary Moran says disproportionately interact with law enforcement on campuses. The organization has grown into a student representative body that not only helps Latino parents advocate for their children's access to education but also acts on behalf of all students — last month, the group presented its 30 NOLA Ed Watch school accountability campaign to the New Orleans City Council.</p>

<p>The group's role was amplified as a critical voice speaking for the hundreds of immigrant students in Louisiana following Trump's decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which gives protections to more than 800,000 "dreamers" who came to the country as minors, including roughly 2,000 young people in Louisiana.</p>

<p>The New Orleans City Council also passed a resolution calling on Congress to preserve DACA and grant "dreamers" permanent legal status.</p>

<p>DACA protections were set to expire this month, but the U.S. Supreme Court declined to take up the Trump administration's challenge of the Obama-era ruling until lower courts have heard the case. Last month, the office of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services also issued new guidance to accept new applications for DACA status.</p>

<p>It's a short-term victory for thousands of people while Congress is deadlocked with Trump over the program's future.</p>

<p>For the roughly 11 million in the U.S. without legal status, including 70,000 people in Louisiana, mounting the challenges to federal and local policies on immigration begins with organizing among those communities. Immigrants with little legal recourse have manifested power in local organizing — the Congress of Day Laborers has brought the fight to the New Orleans City Council.</p>

<p>"We need afterschool programs for children, we need job training and dignified jobs and dignified housing," Canales said to the crowd outside City Hall Feb. 23. "We live here, we work here, we pay taxes — this is our home. We want to be recognized as part of this community."</p>

<h2 id="americaafteranthonykennedy">America after Anthony Kennedy</h2>

<p>Anthony Kennedy, the longest-serving member of the Supreme Court, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/27/17510800/anthony-kennedy-retiring-read-statement">is retiring</a>.</p>

<p>By Dylan Matthews, Vox, Jun. 27, 2018, 2:07pm EDT <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/6/25/17461318/anthony-kennedy-ideology-retirement-supreme-court">:link:</a></p>

<p>Kennedy has, since at least 2005, been the swing vote on many of the Court’s most ideologically charged decisions, responsible for 5-4 rulings that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/26/8823655/gay-marriage-legal-scotus-obergefell-v-hodges">legalized same-sex marriage</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/27/11713644/whole-womans-health-supreme-court-choice">preserved Roe v. Wade</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapper_v._Amnesty_International_USA">upheld warrantless wiretapping</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC">blew up</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCutcheon_v._FEC">campaign finance</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Free_Enterprise_Club%27s_Freedom_Club_PAC_v._Bennett">restrictions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_v._Heller">overturned DC’s handgun ban</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/5/30/15710628/voting-rights-act-new-north-carolina-shelby-voter-identification-id">weakened the Voting Rights Act</a>. That position has made him one of the most powerful people in America for well over a decade now, not even counting the 18 years he shared his position as the Court’s swing voter with Sandra Day O’Connor.</p>

<p>But Kennedy, who turns 82 this July, is already the 14th longest-serving justice (out of 113) in the Court’s history. President Donald Trump reportedly nominated Neil Gorsuch, a former Kennedy clerk, to the Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-neil-gorsuch.html">in part to reassure Kennedy</a> that he could trust Trump with picking his replacement. It’s not surprising he decided it was ultimately time to go.</p>

<p>With Kennedy gone, the Court’s decisions on issues where he’s a down-the-line conservative — like campaign finance and corruption, most business regulation and voting cases, gun rights, religious liberty, etc. — likely won’t change. There’s already a 5-4 conservative majority on those, so conservative rulings like the ones Kennedy wrote or joined in <em>DC v. Heller</em>, <em>Citizens United</em>, or <em>Hobby Lobby</em> will continue apace.</p>

<p>What will change are rulings on issues where Kennedy has helped maintain a shaky 5-4 center-left consensus. Because of the court’s longstanding principle of stare decisis, or obeying past precedent barring a compelling reason not to do so, some liberal Court achievements are likely to stay. But a Court without Kennedy is substantially more likely to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overturn <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and allow states (and maybe the federal government too) to ban most or all abortions.</li>

<li>Reject challenges to capital punishment and solitary confinement.</li>

<li>Rule in favor of religious challenges to anti-discrimination law, and perhaps, in an extreme case, reverse some past Supreme Court rulings on gay rights.</li>

<li>Bar government actors from engaging in explicit race-based affirmative action.
And there are likely to be more aftershocks that are hard to anticipate this far in advance.</li>
</ul>

<p>An America after Anthony Kennedy looks significantly different from America before. The movement against mass incarceration could run into unprecedented resistance from the Court, and the anti-abortion movement could notch its greatest victories in a half-century.</p>

<p>This Supreme Court vacancy will give Donald Trump the power to shift jurisprudence on a range of critical issues. It could wind up being the most important part of his legacy.</p>

<h3 id="abortioninamericaafterkennedy">Abortion in America after Kennedy</h3>

<p>Nothing is guaranteed, but Kennedy’s replacement will be much likelier to join a decision overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and giving states the ability to ban abortions as early as the first trimester. </p>

<p>This may take years after the replacement’s confirmation; a state would need to pass a law clearly incompatible with the Court’s existing approach to abortion rights and wait for the challenge to reach the Supreme Court before the new justice would have a chance to join a ruling. The anti-abortion movement might choose a more cautious strategy, instead chipping away at <em>Roe</em> with measures that fall short of outright bans. But with Kennedy gone, the votes for an outright reversal of <em>Roe</em> would probably be there.</p>

<p>Once Kennedy (or one of the liberals) leaves the court, UC Berkeley law dean and constitutional law expert <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-chemerinsky-trump-effect-on-supreme-court-20161109-story.html">Erwin Chemerinsky</a> wrote in 2016, “There almost certainly will be a majority to overrule <em>Roe v. Wade</em> and allow states to prohibit abortions.”</p>

<p>It’s certainly possible that Chief Justice Roberts will <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/2/1/14464120/neil-gorsuch-supreme-court-roe-v-wade-trump-abortion">decline to join an anti-Roe majority due to precedent</a> and a desire to avoid a massive public backlash, but there are reasons to think it unlikely. Roberts has on two occasions joined decisions overturning past Supreme Court precedent: one was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montejo_v._Louisiana">case on the right to counsel</a> and how it can and cannot be waived, and the other was <em>Citizens United</em>, which sparked massive national outrage. </p>

<p>Roberts voted to overturn precedent anyway, knowing a backlash was inevitable. Indeed, in his <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/558/310/concurrence.html">concurrence</a> to <em>Citizens United</em>, Roberts suggested that “hotly contested” issues might provide for exceptions from the principle of stare decisis and respect for precedent. Also possible is that instead of decapitating <em>Roe</em> in one blow, Roberts will instead “vote to kill it with 1,000 cuts rather than overturn it outright,” as <a href="http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-hasen-roberts-swing-vote-20170410-story.html">UC Irvine Law’s Richard Hasen</a> puts it. </p>

<p>Perhaps we’ll see another case like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/27/11713644/whole-womans-health-supreme-court-choice">Whole Women’s Health</a> <em>(</em> a 2016 decision where Kennedy joined the Court’s liberals in striking down Texas regulations meant to disrupt abortion provision), but this time the court sides with the state’s restrictions. Perhaps another state takes its 20-week ban to the Supreme Court, which then relaxes <em>Roe</em> and rules that you can bar abortions that early in a pregnancy. Bit by bit, the Court enables states to get more creative and bold in their restrictions, until one day it finally gives up the ghost and announces <em>Roe</em> is dead.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of a reversal, the current gap in abortion services between red and blue states will become even more severe. The pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/article/2018/01/policy-trends-states-2017">classifies 29 states as “hostile or extremely hostile”</a> to abortion rights, of which all but two voted for Trump in 2016 (the exceptions are Rhode Island and Virginia). It rated only 12 as supportive, with Montana the only supportive red state.</p>

<p>There are already substantial gaps between states in access to abortion. A <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667%2817%2930158-5/fulltext#sec1">study</a> by Guttmacher researchers found that while the average American woman aged 15 to 44 lives fewer than 11 miles from the nearest clinic, that number varies dramatically from state to state and county to county. In Mississippi, the average woman lives 68.8 miles from the nearest clinic. In North Dakota, the number is 151.6. A lot of the variation is just a function of how rural the state is, but the political environment appears to be a significant factor as well.</p>

<p>Overturning <em>Roe</em> would harden these gaps between states, and also open up a vast new market for self-induced abortions. That market already exists. Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, an economist and writer who has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/opinion/sunday/the-return-of-the-diy-abortion.html">conducted research on demand for abortion</a> using Google search data, once <a href="https://www.vox.com/conversations/2017/6/13/15768622/facebook-google-racism-social-media-seth-everybody-lies">told Vox</a>, “I was blown away by how frequently people are searching for ways to do abortions themselves now. These searches are concentrated in parts of the country where it’s hard to get an abortion and they rose substantially when it became harder to get an abortion.”</p>

<p>But while “self-induced” conjures up images of wire hangers and back alleys, the form this will most likely take is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/04/28/if-abortions-become-illegal-heres-how-the-government-will-prosecute-women-who-have-them/?utm_term=.1476df8704eb">greater usage of abortion pills</a>. About a third of all abortions, and a higher share of early-term abortions, are <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/induced-abortion-united-states">medication abortions</a> now. It’s possible that’s what some of the <a href="https://talkpoverty.org/2017/08/14/no-isnt-self-induced-abortion-crisis/">searches for “self-induced abortion”</a> were about, anyway.</p>

<p>How much do you want to bet that the US market for RU-486, purchased from online pharmacies or other dubiously legal means, will explode in the aftermath of <em>Roe</em> falling?</p>

<h3 id="prisonsandthedeathpenaltyinamericaafterkennedy">Prisons and the death penalty in America after Kennedy</h3>

<p>Currently, there appears to be a five-justice majority on the Supreme Court for sharply limiting solitary confinement in America. Without Kennedy, that majority has evaporated, likely replaced with a harder-line majority that could preserve the practice.</p>

<p>In 2015, Anthony Kennedy filed a concurring opinion in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1428_1a7d.pdf">Davis v. Ayala</a>, a death-penalty case in which the Court (joined by Kennedy) sided against the defendant. Nevertheless, Kennedy used his concurrence to unleash a bracing jeremiad against the evils of solitary confinement, in which the defendant had been held for most of his 25-plus years in prison.</p>

<p>”Research still confirms what this Court suggested over a century ago: Years on end of near-total isolation exact a terrible price,” Kennedy wrote. “In a case that presented the issue, the judiciary may be required, within its proper jurisdiction and authority, to determine whether workable alternative systems for long-term confinement exist, and, if so, whether a correctional system should be required to adopt them.”</p>

<p>The implication was clear: Kennedy wanted advocates to bring a case challenging the constitutionality of long-term solitary confinement on the grounds that it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. He <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/justice-kennedy-says-make-my-day-solitary">basically dared them to</a>, and suggested that if such a case reached the Court, he’d be inclined to limit the practice. </p>

<p>Sharon Dolovich, a law professor at UCLA and faculty director of the university’s Prison Law &amp; Policy Program, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/8/22/12484000/supreme-court-liberal-clinton">told me in 2016</a> that solitary confinement was the “one major unresolved issue” in criminal justice “that is definitely going to come up” in the next few years.</p>

<p>It’s a long time coming. At any given moment, about <a href="http://solitarywatch.com/facts/faq/">80,000 to 100,000 people</a> are held in solitary confinement in the US; in many states, the average stint in solitary lasts years. And it’s been that way at least since the 1980s, without any federal court intervention to halt it.</p>

<p>”There’s so much data now — physiological data, psychological data, reentry data — there’s so much data making clear the extended physical, psychological, and emotional trauma that people suffer in extended solitary confinement, it would be so easy for the Court just to point to it all and conclude there’s an objective harm,” Dolovich said.</p>

<p>Jonathan Simon, a law professor and director of the Center for the Study of Law and Society at UC Berkeley, also speaking in 2016, told me that solitary confinement is on “the verge of being found unconstitutional, at least in its most excessive forms.” Just what “excessive” means there is, naturally, a matter of debate, and Simon cautions that the Court could err on the side of giving prisons too much leeway.</p>

<p>He noted that <em>Ashker v. Brown</em>, a recent case <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/09/scaling-back-solitary/403441/">challenging solitary confinement in California</a> that ended in a settlement rather than reaching the Supreme Court, “involved a class of inmates that had been held more than 10 years, and the settlement will still allow people to be held up to five years, and even after that they can still be held in solitary if they’re given programming and special services.” By contrast, the United Nations special rapporteur on torture has called for an <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40097#.V7I5RJMrL6A">absolute ban on solitary confinement lasting 15 days or more</a>. “I’m not sure Kennedy or any justice would go nearly that far,” Simon says.</p>

<p>But without Kennedy on the court, a ruling going even as far as a five-year maximum becomes less likely.</p>

<p>Solitary confinement is not the only case where a more conservative justice could make a difference. In 2011, Kennedy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Plata">wrote a 5-4 decision</a> upholding a lower court order that California release tens of thousands of prisoners to reduce overcrowding, which the state itself admitted was unconstitutional. It was, Simon told me, “the first prisoners’ rights decision to come down in favor of the prisoner in a long time. It ended mass incarceration in California.” More decisions like that could come if Kennedy stays on the court</p>

<p>Kennedy was also the best hope that opponents of capital punishment have for a ruling against the practice, even though he’s often sided with conservatives in some past death penalty cases on the constitutionality of, say, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossip_v._Gross">using a particular lethal injection method</a>.</p>

<p>Back in 2016, Simon told me that he was “somewhat optimistic” that Kennedy would join with Breyer and Ginsburg (who have already declared their belief that capital punishment is across-the-board unconstitutional), Sotomayor, and Kagan in an anti-death penalty case. “The reason … goes back to his interest in dignity,” Simon said. “The strongest of the opinions in <em>Furman</em> ” — the 1972 case that briefly abolished capital punishment — “was William Brennan’s, and Brennan based it most directly on human dignity. He argued the Eighth Amendment bans any punishment you can’t carry out without respecting the dignity of those being punished.”</p>

<p>Kennedy leaned heavily on the importance of dignity in <em>Brown v. Plata</em>, the California prison overcrowding case. Simon even found an early Kennedy opinion from when he was a circuit court judge in the 1970s in which he quoted Brennan’s concurrence in <em>Furman</em> at length. </p>

<p>Even if Kennedy didn’t buy a dignity argument for abolishing the death penalty, Simon said he thought Kennedy would be swayed by the issue of delays, which Breyer raised in his 2015 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-7955_aplc.pdf">anti-capital punishment dissent</a> — and which were the entire reason for the prisoner’s stay in solitary confinement that Kennedy assailed in his concurrence last year.</p>

<p>”[Kennedy] came and gave a talk at Berkeley Law about a year and a half ago, and one of my colleagues was rude enough to ask him point blank whether he thought the death penalty was compatible with human dignity,” Simon told me. “Of course he declined to answer, but he said kind of cryptically, ‘Here in California you guys take so long enough to execute people that we may not even need to reach that cliff.’”</p>

<p>This is all moot now that Kennedy is gone, sure to be replaced by a more doctrinaire supporter of capital punishment.</p>

<p>Having him off the bench will also prevent incremental steps against it from going forward. In 2008, Kennedy wrote for a 5-4 liberal majority that it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_v._Louisiana">unconstitutional to impose the death penalty</a> on people convicted merely of rape, not murder. Without him on the Court, incremental limitations of capital punishment’s scope like that become less likely.</p>

<h3 id="affirmativeactioninamericaafterkennedy">Affirmative action in America after Kennedy</h3>

<p>Anthony Kennedy is hardly an uncritical supporter of affirmative action in public employment, education admissions, or other realms.</p>

<p>In 2003, he dissented in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2002/02-241">Grutter v. Bollinger</a>, a case where O’Connor and the Court’s liberals ruled that the University of Michigan Law School’s racial affirmative action system was constitutional, and not an unconstitutional quota system. In 2007’s <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/05-908">Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1</a>, he was the swing vote behind a ruling holding that Seattle, Washington, and Louisville, Kentucky’s voluntary desegregation programs were unconstitutional. </p>

<p>In 2009’s <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/07-1428">Ricci v. DeStefano</a>, he ruled that New Haven, Connecticut’s Fire Department discriminated against white applicants for promotions. He wrote the controlling opinion in 2014’s <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2013/12-682">Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action</a>, which upheld Michigan’s ban on affirmative action.</p>

<p>But he is not an implacable foe of the practice, either. In his <em>Grutter</em> dissent, he echoed Justice Lewis Powell, who held Kennedy’s seat before him and wrote the controlling opinion in <em>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</em>, a 1978 case in which the Court held that affirmative action was constitutional but explicit quotas (“16 of the 100 students must be black”) went too far.</p>

<p>“There is no constitutional objection to the goal of considering race as one modest factor among many others to achieve diversity, but an educational institution must ensure, through sufficient procedures, that each applicant receives individual consideration and that race does not become a predominant factor in the admissions decision-making,” Kennedy wrote in the <em>Grutter</em> dissent.</p>

<p>This position of his became additionally relevant with 2016’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/23/11743972/fisher-texas-affirmative-action-supreme-court">Fisher v. University of Texas</a>, in which he wrote a majority opinion defending the University of Texas’s use of race in admissions. With <em>Fisher</em>, he effectively became the one vote holding together the Court’s majority defending affirmative action in at least some cases.</p>

<p>With Kennedy gone, replaced by a more stalwart conservative, it’s likely that the uneasy affirmative action consensus will buckle, and a ruling finally doing away with public affirmative action programs will come.</p>

<h3 id="gayrightsinamericaafterkennedy">Gay rights in America after Kennedy</h3>

<p>Arguably, Kennedy’s greatest legacy on the Court — and certainly what he <em>hopes</em> will be his greatest legacy — are his decisions expanding the scope of LGBTQ rights.</p>

<p>In 1996’s <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1995/94-1039">Romer v. Evans</a>, he authored the Court’s first major pro-gay rights decision, invoking the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause in striking down a Colorado state constitutional amendment that prevented cities and towns from adopting their own bans on discrimination against gays, lesbians, or bisexuals.</p>

<p>Seven years later, in 2003’s <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2002/02-102">Lawrence v. Texas</a>, Kennedy wrote for a 6-3 court invalidating Texas’s ban on oral and anal sex between two men or two women. That decision overrode 1986’s <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1985/85-140">Bowers v. Hardwick</a>, a decision upholding Georgia’s sodomy law. In <em>Lawrence</em>, Kennedy tellingly did not use equal protection reasoning but instead found that any bans on consensual sexual behavior between adults, regardless of the genders involved, violate the due process clause’s guarantee of personal liberty. (This was similar to the reasoning the court had used in <em>Roe</em> and to invalidate bans on contraception in <em>Griswold v. Connecticut.</em> )</p>

<p>A decade later, in 2013, Kennedy wrote the 5-4 decision in <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2012/12-307">United States v. Windsor</a> overturning the federal Defense of Marriage Act on equal protection grounds. The decision required the federal government to respect and honor same-sex marriages at the state level, while still allowing states to ban same-sex marriage if they wished. And two years after that, in 2015’s <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/14-556">Obergefell v. Hodges</a>, he swept away bans on same-sex marriage altogether, ending with a stirring tribute to the value of marriage that’s become a mainstay of wedding readings in the years since:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were. As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death. It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is fair, then, for gay rights advocates to worry about what could happen to the <em>Obergefell</em> precedent now that Kennedy has retired.</p>

<p>There are certainly some conservatives on the Court who are interested in chipping away at the ruling’s guarantees. Gorsuch, Thomas, and Alito in 2017 dissented from a ruling requiring Arkansas to list same-sex parents on their children’s birth certificates, arguing that to do so does not violate <em>Obergefell</em>. That, Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern argued, set the stage for a legal strategy based on gradually chipping away at the right to marriage until it’s practically worthless.</p>

<p>“[John] Roberts would be free to rewrite <em>Windsor</em> and <em>Obergefell</em> however he wants,” <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2017/07/how_the_supreme_court_could_overturn_obergefell_v_hodges.html">Stern writes</a>. “Roberts could remain faithful to the original text of both decisions. He could also reverse them. But the likeliest possibility is that Roberts first cuts them down to a single guarantee—the right for same-sex couples to receive a marriage license with no attendant privileges. In case after case, Roberts could vote to allow discrimination against same-sex couples but affirm their right to the license itself.”</p>

<p>The trouble with this argument is that we don’t actually know where Roberts stands on the precedential value of <em>Obergefell</em>. He didn’t <a href="https://takecareblog.com/blog/making-sense-of-the-scotus-per-curiam-in-arkansas-ssm-birth-certificate-case">register a dissent in the Arkansas case</a> the way his conservative colleagues did; it’s possible he dissented without letting that dissent be recorded but it’s also possible he sided with the liberals.</p>

<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/emerging-consensus-on-lgbt-issues-findings-from-the-2017-american-values-atlas/">majorities of Americans in 44 of the 50 states</a> now support same-sex marriage. The overwhelming public opinion shift in favor of marriage equality might make Roberts more hesitant to chip away at the right, and it also might deny the Court opportunities to take up the issue, if the popularity of same-sex marriage prevents states from trying to restrict the right in ways that would be challenged and make it to the Court.</p>

<p>My hunch is that LGBTQ rights are the part of Kennedy’s legacy least likely to be sacrificed should he leave the Supreme Court. But certainly a Court without Kennedy, and with a Trump-appointed successor, will be less friendly to LGBTQ causes than a Court with him around.</p>
