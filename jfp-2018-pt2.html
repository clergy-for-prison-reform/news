<h2 id="trumpundercutshousegopdontwastetimeonimmigration">Trump Undercuts House GOP: Don't Waste Time on Immigration</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday told his fellow Republicans in Congress to "stop wasting their time" on immigration legislation until after the November elections. GOP leaders said they'd press on anyway, but his comments further damaged their attempt to win over wavering lawmakers for a measure already facing likely defeat.</p>

<p>A little more than four months before the congressional elections, Trump also took a new shot at Democratic lawmakers, accusing them of spreading "phony stories of sadness and grief" about young immigrants separated from parents by his "zero tolerance" policy on illegal border crossings.</p>

<p>Trump's tweet on immigration legislation was the latest example of his abrupt reversals on issues, to the dismay of Republicans who crave his backing as a seal of approval for conservative voters. Just Tuesday, he met privately with GOP lawmakers and told them he supported the immigration legislation and would have their backs in November.</p>

<p>"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November," he tweeted. "Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solve this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!"</p>

<p>Trump's history of turnabouts has made it harder for congressional leaders to win over other lawmakers for the immigration bill. The measure would grant young "Dreamer" immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children a chance for citizenship — a move many Republicans worry would enrage conservative voters who'd view it as amnesty.</p>

<p>"You just fear that tweet in the morning," said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a supporter of efforts to help Dreamers. She said members think, "The day's not over. Heck, it's not even noon yet. How many times could he change his mind?"</p>

<p>Despite Trump's stance, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the chamber would press ahead on legislation next week. Differences between conservative and moderate Republicans delayed a vote initially planned for Thursday.</p>

<p>The bill would also require the government to separate fewer migrant children from parents when they are detained and finance Trump's proposed wall with Mexico.</p>

<p>"I think it's important that the House be able to show we can take the action," said McCarthy, R-Calif.</p>

<p>"We're not giving up," said No. 3 House GOP leader Steve Scalise, R-La.</p>

<p>House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he "absolutely" would continue the immigration push.</p>

<p>"I don't think it will affect the mood of members who got very close yesterday and want to continue," he said.</p>

<p>In a private meeting late Thursday, party leaders said they would add provisions to the bill in hopes of rounding up the support they need.</p>

<p>Trump's comments come amid an international outcry over the separation of migrant families at the southern border. Trump asserted Thursday that Congress could provide the "only real solution" to the crisis.</p>

<p>The last ditch effort on immigration ahead of the midterm elections was meant to help vulnerable Republicans this fall.</p>

<p>A measure backed by conservative lawmakers failed Thursday. Hours later Republican leaders postponed final voting on what was billed as a compromise immigration package until next week as negotiators made a last-ditch push for support.</p>

<p>Lawmakers said two new provisions would be added to the bill in hopes of winning votes. One would require employers to use an online system to verify the citizenship of their workers, which could attract conservatives.</p>

<p>The other would make it easier for employers to retain migrant workers, which could bolster support from Republicans from agricultural regions. Legislation on those issues had been promised for July, but skeptical lawmakers wanted it sooner.</p>

<p>Calling Democrats "obstructionists" and accusing them of not caring about border security, Trump tweeted Friday that voters need to elect more Republicans.</p>

<p>"Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill," he said.</p>

<p>Despite the president's prediction of a "Red wave" this fall, Republicans are facing an uphill battle this November as they seek to hold control of the House and Senate. Headwinds from the controversy-embracing president and a wave of retirements in the House have put the GOP majority at risk there.</p>

<p>Democrats face a more challenging map to retaking control in the Senate, with the GOP eyeing pick-ups of seats in states Trump carried in 2016.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus is asking Gov. Phil Bryant to recall the Mississippi National Guard from the U.S.' southern border and refuse to send more troops.</p>

<p>In a hand-delivered letter to the governor's office, the caucus says it does not want any Mississippi troops at the border while the policy to separate families is in effect.</p>

<p>Around 2,300 migrant children have been separated from their families on the U.S' southern border since May 2018. On June 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending the separation of families, creating a policy of family detention.</p>

<p>"While the president's executive order may temporarily pause the separation of families, we urge you to stand with governors across the country who, in a bipartisan manner, refuse to support the enforcement of this inhumane policy of jailing children," the letter says. "We pray you that you agree and Mississippi will stand on the right side of history."</p>

<p>The letter makes a plea to Bryant's understanding as a father and grandfather, asking him to think about the vulnerability of children. It also references the fact that the U.S. is a "nation of immigrants built by the hands of a mixture of races."</p>

<p>Sonya Williams Barnes, chair of the caucus, and 14 other members, a mixture of Senators and Representatives, signed the letter.</p>

<p>"This is not what Mississippi represents," the letter says. "We call on you to take action now."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant is endorsing a prosecutor in a Republican congressional runoff.</p>

<p>Michael Guest of Brandon, who won 45 percent of the vote in a six-person field on June 6, announced Bryant's endorsement Wednesday. The 48-year-old district attorney for Rankin and Madison counties faces Madison Republican Whit Hughes in a runoff Tuesday. Hughes won 22 percent of the vote. The 43-year-old former state development official later worked as fundraiser for a Baptist hospital system.</p>

<p>Republican Bryant says Guest will be a supporter of President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Hughes is criticizing Guest for refusing to debate.</p>

<p>Guest and Hughes are running in the 3rd District in central Mississippi. Current GOP congressman Gregg Harper isn't seeking re-election. The winner faces Democratic state Rep. Michael Ted Evans and Reform Party member Matthew Holland.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The parking lot of Christ United Methodist Church in northeast Jackson looked like the rear of any prison in the state this morning—lined with white Mississippi Department of Corrections vehicles and vans. Hundreds of judges, lawyers, legislators, politicians, corrections officers, re-entry advocates and previously incarcerated people gathered in the church hall for the 2018 Statewide Re-Entry Symposium.</p>

<p>MDOC Commissioner Pelicia Hall hosted the program and introduced the notorious keynote speaker: Richard F. "Dickie" Scruggs. He is a former high-powered trial attorney in Mississippi known for lawsuits against the asbestos and tobacco industries, as well as for suing insurance companies that would not pay out to homeowners after Hurricane Katrina devastation. In 2007, Scruggs pled guilty to conspiracy to bribe Circuit Judge Henry L. Lackey in 2008 and then pled guilty in 2009 to a bribery scheme involving Hinds County Circuit Judge Bobby DeLaughter and former Hinds County District Attorney Ed Peters. Scruggs served six years in federal prison, and was released in 2014. DeLaughter also served time, and Peters got immunity for admitting his role in the scheme.</p>

<p>At the symposium, Scruggs made the crowd laugh, but also shared personal stories from his time in federal prison to underscore how people inside the system view re-entry. The federal system often carries much longer sentences, especially without a parole system. Scruggs talked of fellow inmates adjusting to the prison conditions, and fearing life on the outside, where they have to make decisions for themselves again and perhaps return to the same environments where they landed in trouble.</p>

<p>He also painted the grim reality that without familial support, many returning citizens struggle to successfully re-enter society. Studies back Scruggs up.</p>

<p>"I think when we think of re-entry we want to think of men and women released from prison, reconnecting with their families, getting jobs, going to school, getting back into the American mainstream," Sruggs said. "But many of the people like I served time with have a different view of re-entry: They have by and large ruptured their family relationships. I bet you would be surprised that the typical inmate during the time he is in prison gets two visits. It's not two visits a year; that's two visits the entire time."</p>

<p>Scruggs talked about re-entry programs needing to help at-risk returning citizens mitigate their fears that include going back to the dysfunctional lives they may have led before incarceration.</p>

<p>After being released from prison, Scruggs founded 2nd Chance Mississippi, a nonprofit organization that helps those who did not finish high school obtain a GED and skills-based training to join the workforce. Not all the people in Scruggs' program have been incarcerated.</p>

<p>Mississippi does not often make it easy for returning citizens to become a part of the American mainstream, as Scruggs puts it. There is a list of 22 disenfranchising crimes that permanently prevent Mississippians from voting if convicted.</p>

<p>Matthew Riley, a state re-entry coordinator, recently told the Jackson Free Press that some mid-level employment positions are closed to ex-offenders per state law such as the casinos. Even restaurants or hotels attached to the casinos will deny formerly incarcerated people's job applications.</p>

<p>Riley spoke at the re-entry symposium this afternoon about his 82 counties in 82 days tour across the state in search of employment opportunities for returning citizens leaving the state's corrections system. Some had zero-tolerance policies, refusing to hire formerly incarcerated people. He asks those employers to follow up if they ever have a change of heart. He learned that most supervisors he talked to are willing to give people a second chance.</p>

<p>"The goal was to reach out to the employers ... to develop partnerships to let them know we have individuals that have been released that have credentials," Riley said "... As we talk to these individual employers, we had good response for the most part ... but in some cases I was thrown out the door."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A group of about 30 demonstrators on Monday burned a Mississippi state flag, saying it symbolizes the racism at the heart of the state's problems with poverty, education and health care.</p>

<p>Demonstrators with the Poor People's Campaign burned a Confederate battle flag and then a separate Mississippi state flag Monday in front of the governor's mansion.</p>

<p>Mississippi's flag has contained the Confederate battle emblem since 1894, and residents who voted in a 2001 statewide election chose to keep the emblem on it.</p>

<p>The campaign includes activists in 40 states who are demonstrating, seeking to force communities to address poverty. They say poverty continues to be ignored and only a "moral revival" can bring it to the nation's consciousness.</p>

<p>"This flag needs to come down," said organizer Danyelle Holmes of Jackson. "This flag needs to burn. We're burning the hate out of their hearts. We're burning the hate out of our state."</p>

<p>Monday was the climax of six weeks of demonstrations in Mississippi. Last week, for example, protesters built a cardboard shack symbolizing homelessness with signs calling for better social services and health care for the poor. Holmes, though, said lingering white supremacy is bound up in all of Mississippi's problems.</p>

<p>Confederate symbols have been the subject of widespread debate across the South, particularly since the racially motivated killings of nine African-American parishioners in 2015 at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and after last year's violent protests at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>

<p>Although flag protests are frequent in Mississippi, burning the banner is rare.</p>

<p>Several city and county governments and all eight of Mississippi's public universities have stopped flying the state flag in recent years amid critics' concerns that it does not properly represent a state where 38 percent of residents are African-American. Supporters of the flag say it represents history.</p>

<p>Republican Gov. Phil Bryant maintains that if the flag is to be changed, another election should be held.</p>

<p>"This is an unfortunate instance of a group exercising their rights in a completely disrespectful and unproductive manner," Bryant said in an emailed statement. "There are better ways to bring attention to one's opinions than burning the state of Mississippi flag on a public street corner."</p>

<p>McALLEN, Texas (AP) — Inside an old warehouse in South Texas, hundreds of immigrant children wait in a series of cages created by metal fencing. One cage had 20 children inside. Scattered about are bottles of water, bags of chips and large foil sheets intended to serve as blankets.</p>

<p>One teenager told an advocate who visited that she was helping care for a young child she didn't know because the child's aunt was somewhere else in the facility. She said she had to show others in her cell how to change the girl's diaper.</p>

<p>The U.S. Border Patrol on Sunday allowed reporters to briefly visit the facility where it holds families arrested at the southern U.S. border, responding to new criticism and protests over the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy and resulting separation of families.</p>

<p>More than 1,100 people were inside the large, dark facility that's divided into separate wings for unaccompanied children, adults on their own, and mothers and fathers with children. The cages in each wing open out into common areas to use portable restrooms. The overhead lighting in the warehouse stays on around the clock.</p>

<p>The Border Patrol said close to 200 people inside the facility were minors unaccompanied by a parent. Another 500 were "family units," parents and children. Many adults who crossed the border without legal permission could be charged with illegal entry and placed in jail, away from their children.</p>

<p>Reporters were not allowed by agents to interview any of the detainees or take photos.</p>

<p>Nearly 2,000 children have been taken from their parents since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the policy, which directs Homeland Security officials to refer all cases of illegal entry into the United States for prosecution. Church groups and human rights advocates have sharply criticized the policy, calling it inhumane.</p>

<p>Stories have spread of children being torn from their parents' arms, and parents not being able to find where their kids have gone. A group of congressional lawmakers visited the same facility Sunday and were set to visit a longer-term shelter holding around 1,500 children — many of whom were separated from their parents.</p>

<p>"Those kids inside who have been separated from their parents are already being traumatized," said Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who was denied entry earlier this month to children's shelter. "It doesn't matter whether the floor is swept and the bedsheets tucked in tight."</p>

<p>In Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for people trying to enter the U.S., Border Patrol officials argue that they have to crack down on migrants and separate adults from children as a deterrent to others.</p>

<p>"When you exempt a group of people from the law ... that creates a draw," said Manuel Padilla, the Border Patrol's chief agent here. "That creates the trends right here."</p>

<p>Agents running the holding facility — generally known as "Ursula" for the name of the street it's on — said everyone detained is given adequate food, access to showers and laundered clothes, and medical care. People are supposed to move through the facility quickly. Under U.S. law, children are required to be turned over within three days to shelters funded by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>Padilla said agents in the Rio Grande Valley have allowed families with children under the age of 5 to stay together in most cases.</p>

<p>An advocate who spent several hours in the facility Friday said she was deeply troubled by what she found.</p>

<p>Michelle Brane, director of migrant rights at the Women's Refugee Commission, met with a 16-year-old girl who had been taking care of a young girl for three days. The teen and others in their cage thought the girl was 2 years old.</p>

<p>"She had to teach other kids in the cell to change her diaper," Brane said.</p>

<p>Brane said that after an attorney started to ask questions, agents found the girl's aunt and reunited the two. It turned out that the girl was actually 4 years old. Part of the problem was that she didn't speak Spanish, but K'iche, a language indigenous to Guatemala.</p>

<p>"She was so traumatized that she wasn't talking," Brane said. "She was just curled up in a little ball."</p>

<p>Brane said she also saw officials at the facility scold a group of 5-year-olds for playing around in their cage, telling them to settle down. There are no toys or books.</p>

<p>But one boy nearby wasn't playing with the rest. According to Brane, he was quiet, clutching a piece of paper that was a photocopy of his mother's ID card.</p>

<p>"The government is literally taking kids away from their parents and leaving them in inappropriate conditions," Brane said. "If a parent left a child in a cage with no supervision with other 5-year-olds, they'd be held accountable."</p>

<p>Dr. Colleen Kraft, the head of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that she visited a small shelter in Texas recently, which she declined to identity. A toddler inside the 60-bed facility caught her eye — she was crying uncontrollably and pounding her little fists on mat.</p>

<p>Staff members tried to console the child, who looked to be about 2 years old, Kraft said. She had been taken from her mother the night before and brought to the shelter.</p>

<p>The staff gave her books and toys — but they weren't allowed to pick her up, to hold her or hug her to try to calm her. As a rule, staff aren't allowed to touch the children there, she said.</p>

<p>"The stress is overwhelming," she said. "The focus needs to be on the welfare of these children, absent of politics."</p>

<h2 id="updatedrepthompsonreturnsshermandonationwillendorsebaria">UPDATED: Rep. Thompson Returns Sherman Donation; Will Endorse Baria</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/18/sherman-donated-wicker-thompson-sessions-baria-all/ </p>

<p>JACKSON — Howard Sherman, the slight frontrunner coming out of a crowded Democratic primary election, has a short but unique history of donations in federal elections—from a 2003 donation to then-U.S. Sen Jeff Sessions, a conservative Republican, to a 2018 donation to U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the only Mississippi Democrat elected to federal office.</p>

<p>In May 2018, records show that Sherman donated $481 to U.S. Rep. Thompson, the state's only black and Democratic congressman who is running unopposed. But after an earlier version of this story reported Sherman's contribution, Congressman Thompson called the Jackson Free Press to say he returned the contribution from Howard Sherman last week. He said the donation came in electronically, but if it had been a physical check, he would not have deposited it.</p>

<p>“I’m not supporting him,” Thompson told the Jackson Free Press. When asked to elaborate on why he did not want to take Sherman's contribution, Thompson said it would be misleading.</p>

<p>“Well, it would have been, I think, disingenuous on my part to take a contribution from someone who’s running for office that I’m not supporting because it could be construed that I am,” Thompson said.</p>

<p>Thompson told the Jackson Free Press that he will probably make a public announcement before the week’s end about supporting Baria in the run-off election on June 26.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press is reaching out to the Sherman campaign for comment.</p>

<p>Sherman's Republican Donations</p>

<p>In 2003, Sherman gave $500 to then-U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is now President Donald Trump's attorney general and presiding over the new zero-tolerance immigration policy on the southern border, including family separation.</p>

<p>Sherman recently explained that donation to the Jackson Free Press. After Sept. 11, 2001, Sherman said a friend and Nobel Prize winner called him up about a possible idea to combat biochemical attacks. He needed funds for his research, and that led Sherman to Washington, D.C., where U.S. Sen. Sessions knew Anthony Fauci, the then-director of the National Institutes of Health. The goal was to get support from NIH for the research so that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency would fund it, Sherman said.</p>

<p>"We fly to Washington. We go to a cocktail party, (pay) $500, and meet Senator Sessions. He's just the senator of Alabama. I don't know I'm running for the Senate 15 years later," Sherman told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"I'm there trying to help a Nobel Prize winner get funded. He introduces us; we sit in a meeting with Tony Fauci. Tony Fauci takes us over to DARPA, and he gets funded. A Nobel Prize winner is working on something that can make us all safe. If I go back to that moment, do I not go to that cocktail party and get this guy funded to make us safe? Of course not."</p>

<p>Sherman also gave $5,000 to Sen. Roger Wicker last year, whom he could now challenge in November. His wife, the actress Sela Ward and a Mississippi native, also gave $5,000 to Wicker last year. Sherman's campaign website explains that he donated to Wicker as a way to prevent Sen. Chris McDaniel from winning, citing "the fear held by Democrats was, 'What if Chris McDaniel beats Roger Wicker?" He also made a $2,000 contribution to Trent Lott in 2006 because of the former senator's support of Sherman and Ward's Hope Village for Children.</p>

<p>Baria's Federal Donation History </p>

<p>State Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, who is in the run-off election against Sherman, has a long history of donating to Democratic federal elections, with consistent donations to the American Association for Justice PAC and the Trial Lawyers of America PAC.</p>

<p>Most recently, in 2016, Baria gave $500 to Mark Gladney who challenged Rep. Steven Palazzo to represent the Mississippi Coast in Congress. In 2017, Baria donated $3,000 to the Mississippi Democratic Party, FEC filings show.</p>

<p>"I put my money where my interests lie and where I think that folks are trying to improve the situation for folks who don't have a voice otherwise," Baria told the Jackson Free Press in a recent interview when asked about his donations.</p>

<p>"That's been what's guided my professional life, that's been what's guided my political life, and I think you'll find I've been pretty consistent in that regard."</p>

<p>Who's Giving to Them</p>

<p>Now that Baria and Sherman are no longer on the sidelines, their own campaign finances are in the spotlight. Sherman has raised more than $840,000 in campaign funds, but $650,000 of that total are loans he made to his own campaign. Sherman has spent $786,000, current FEC filings show.</p>

<p>Baria has raised about $250,000 without loaning his campaign any money. He had more than $150,000 on-hand to spend in mid-May, FEC filings show. Sherman spent a lot of his funds and was down to $56,000 in cash-on-hand on June 6, FEC filings show. These numbers will likely change before the run-off election on June 26.</p>

<p>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) — An audio recording that appears to capture the heartbreaking voices of small Spanish-speaking children crying out for their parents at a U.S. immigration facility took center stage in the growing uproar over the Trump administration's policy of separating immigrant children from their parents.</p>

<p>"Papa! Papa!" one child is heard weeping in the audio file that was first reported Monday by the nonprofit ProPublica and later provided to The Associated Press.</p>

<p>Human rights attorney Jennifer Harbury said she received the tape from a whistleblower and told ProPublica it was recorded in the last week. She did not provide details about where exactly it was recorded.</p>

<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said she had not heard the audio but said children taken into custody by the government are being treated humanely. She said the government has high standards for detention centers and the children are well cared for, stressing that Congress needs to plug loopholes in the law so families can stay together.</p>

<p>The audio surfaced as politicians and advocates flocked to the U.S.-Mexico border to visit U.S. immigration detention centers and turn up the pressure on the Trump administration.</p>

<p>And the backlash over the policy widened. The Mormon church said it is "deeply troubled" by the separation of families at the border and urged national leaders to find compassionate solutions. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, reversed a decision to send a National Guard helicopter from his state to the Mexican border to assist in a deployment, citing the administration's "cruel and inhumane" policy.</p>

<p>At the border, an estimated 80 people pleaded guilty Monday to immigration charges, including some who asked the judge questions such as "What's going to happen to my daughter?" and "What will happen to my son?"</p>

<p>Attorneys at the hearings said the immigrants had brought two dozen boys and girls with them to the U.S., and the judge replied that he didn't know what would happen to their children.</p>

<p>Several groups of lawmakers toured a nearby facility in Brownsville, Texas, that houses hundreds of immigrant children.</p>

<p>Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico said the location was a former hospital converted into living quarters for children, with rooms divided by age group. There was even a small room for infants, complete with two high chairs, where two baby boys wore matching rugby style shirts with orange and white stripes.</p>

<p>Another group of lawmakers on Sunday visited an old warehouse in McAllen, Texas, where hundreds of children are being held in cages created by metal fencing. One cage held 20 youngsters.</p>

<p>More than 1,100 people were inside the large, dark facility, which is divided into separate wings for unaccompanied children, adults on their own, and mothers and fathers with children.</p>

<p>In Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for people trying to enter the U.S., Border Patrol officials say they must crack down on migrants and separate adults from children as a deterrent to others trying to get into the U.S. illegally.</p>

<p>"When you exempt a group of people from the law ... that creates a draw," said Manuel Padilla, the Border Patrol's chief agent there.</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, speaking to reporters during a tour of San Diego immigration detention facilities with Rep. Juan Vargas and other House Democrats, said family separation is a "heartbreaking, barbarian issue that could be changed in a moment by the president of the United States rescinding his action."</p>

<p>"It so challenges the conscience of our country that it must be changed and must be changed immediately," she said during a news conference at a San Diego terminal that is connected to the airport in Tijuana, Mexico, by a bridge.</p>

<p>U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas announced late Monday that he was introducing emergency legislation intended to keep immigrant families together.</p>

<p>"All Americans are rightly horrified by the images we are seeing on the news, children in tears pulled away from their mothers and fathers," Cruz said. "This must stop."</p>

<p>President Donald Trump emphatically defended his administration's policy Monday, again falsely blaming Democrats.</p>

<p>"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility," he declared. "Not on my watch."</p>

<p>Mississippi Coding Academies, a joint project between Innovate Mississippi and the Mississippi Development Authority, recently named Belhaven resident Javier Peraza as an instructor for two new coding classes that will launch at the end of June.</p>

<p>Peraza, 35, was born in Los Angeles and moved to Dallas with his family in 1996, when he was 13 years old. He dropped out of high school in the 10th grade because he felt like "education wasn't for me" at the time, he said.</p>

<p>"After a while, I realized that was a terrible decision I had made in my life," Peraza said. "I ended up working a bunch of lousy jobs for years, until one day, I realized that I needed to get my life together and get my (General Education Diploma)."</p>

<p>Peraza earned his GED in 1999 and later attended community college at Richland College in Dallas. While there in 2008, he became interested in the world of politics.</p>

<p>He was taking a class on government when his professor offered an extra-credit assignment that involved taking a picture with a staff member of then-Sen. Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign during a rally.</p>

<p>"After hearing (Obama) speak, I decided that I would vote for him and help get him elected, so I started looking into how I could get involved," Peraza said.</p>

<p>He learned that the Obama campaign was offering a six-week internship for campaign organizers and decided to sign up. When campaign staffers informed him he would need to fly out to one of the swing states for the campaign, Peraza said he was initially reluctant because he was still in college and short on money. Ultimately, he chose to enter the program and traveled to Milwaukee. After the 2008 primary, the Obama campaign hired him as a field organizer.</p>

<p>After the 2008 election, Peraza returned to Dallas and worked as an organizer for health-care reform efforts in Texas. While there, he also finished his coursework at Richland College, earning his associate's degree in 2010. After his experiences in Milwaukee and Dallas, Peraza chose to continue his education at the University of San Francisco, where he majored in political science.</p>

<p>He took about a year a half off from college to work on Obama's 2012 presidential campaign. Then, he returned to USF, and during his senior year, he decided to become a teacher. He joined Teach for America, a nonprofit organization that helps find educators for low-income schools, and the organization assigned him to the Jackson Public Schools district.</p>

<p>Peraza moved to Mississippi from San Francisco in 2014 and worked at Forest Hill High School for one year before becoming a debate coach at Murrah High School. He stayed in that position until May 2018.</p>

<p>While at Murrah, one of his debate students expressed an interest in learning how to code, and prompted Peraza to develop a program that would teach kids that computer skill. Peraza contacted a friend, Devon Cantwell, and together, they created a start-up called Jackson Kids Code in 2017, so students like the one in his debate class could have an avenue to learn coding, Peraza said.</p>

<p>"Jackson Kids Code was initially going to act as a year-round coding course, but later, the focus shifted to summer coding camps," he said. "Later, I found out that Innovate Mississippi was setting up its Mississippi Coding Academies around the same time, and I met up with the organizers to see how we could cooperate. After Innovate started expanding its operations and taking on more students, they invited me to work as an instructor, and I accepted."</p>

<p>As an instructor at Mississippi Coding Academies, Peraza puts together lesson plans and evaluations for students. He is also working on a coding program for JPS students called the Mayor's Summer Jobs Coding Program, which is a partnership between Innovate, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba's office, Apple and other organizations. Four Coding Academies students will teach the JPS coders XCode (the programming language that Apple uses), and then, participants will go to businesses and work on building apps.</p>

<p>"I love working with the kids in these programs because they're hardworking and have a lot of guts, courage, determination and motivation to stick with a program for so long," Peraza said. "These students are dedicated to bettering their lives by learning to code."</p>

<p>In addition to his work with the academies, Peraza is in the process of obtaining a master's degree in criminology at Delta State University.</p>

<h2 id="whitesupremacyprotestersburnconfederateflagneargovernorsmansion">White Supremacy Protesters Burn Confederate Flag Near Governor's Mansion</h2>

<p>The Mississippi branch of the Poor People's Campaign burned a replica of the Confederate Flag and a Mississippi flag outside the Mississippi Governor's Mansion Monday afternoon. Photo by Marie Weidmayer</p>

<p>JACKSON — The charred remains of a replica Confederate flag and a Mississippi flag lay on the sidewalk outside the Mississippi Governor's Mansion Monday afternoon in protest of white supremacy.</p>

<p>Mississippi's chapter of the Poor People's Campaign burned the flags to conclude six weeks of activism against issues such as white supremacy and ecological devastation, National Organizer and Mississippi native Danyelle Holmes told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Forty-one states protested Monday, fighting for four ideals: overcoming poverty, the war economy, ecological devastation and a distorted moral narrative, Holmes said.</p>

<p>"We decided to burn it because it needs to be burned, it needs to come down," Holmes said. "We need a flag that represents all. We need a flag that does not represent hate, and so that's why we took to the state capitol to fight back against white supremacy."</p>

<p>The flag does not represent all the people of Mississippi, and in fact alienates poor people, especially poor black people, Hattiesburg resident AnnaBeth Row told the Jackson Free Press. In Mississippi, white supremacy tells poor white people that they may be poor but at least they are not black and poor, which makes it harder for people to come together, she added.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Sons of Confederate Veterans are fighting hard to keep the state flag to honor the Confederacy. Others are fighting back.</p>

<p>"Burning the Confederate flag means burning false lines of segregation," Row said. "There's this constant othering of the most marginalized people in our society, and this constant othering is what divides us."</p>

<p>Around 20 people gathered in protest, and chants of "hate has no home here" echoed through downtown Jackson. The protest came 48 hours after Gov. Phil Bryant, who attended a white supremacist Citizens Council high school in south Jackson, received the Gov. John J. Pettus Heritage Award from the Sons of Confederate Veterans.</p>

<p>Gov. John Jones Pettus was the 23rd governor of Mississippi who presided over Mississippi's secession on Jan. 9, 1861, to join the Confederacy. A Tennessee native, Pettus moved to Mississippi as a child and owned at least two dozen slaves in Rankin County as an adult. Pettus was one of the state's "fire-eater" pro-slavery politicians, who were the South's strongest proponents of secession in order to both maintain slavery in the South and guarantee that it was extended to new western territories. The fire-eaters also wanted to ensure that Mississippi's fugitive slaves would be returned to their owners after apprehension in other states. Pettus argued that Mississippi could only keep slavery a reality if it seceded and joined the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Pettus' brother, Edmund Winston Pettus—a fire-eater slave owner and later a U.S. senator in Alabama—served as a delegate at the Mississippi secession convention his brother convened. Active in the Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War, he is the namesake of the Edmund Winston Pettus Bridge in Selma, the site of major civil-rights protests in the 1960s.</p>

<p>In 1860, one in two families (49 percent) in Mississippi owned at least one slave. In 1857, Mississippi had passed an anti-manumission law to make freeing slaves illegal, as other southern states were doing up until the Civil War.</p>

<p>Pettus called Mississippi legislators together on Nov. 26, 1860, to vote on becoming one of the first six slave states to secede. Lawmakers stated their reason for secession in Mississippi's Declaration of Secession: "Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery - the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product, which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization."</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press revealed to the world in February 2016 that Gov. Bryant had declared April "Confederate Heritage Month," but with no mention of slavery.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press broke the news in February 2016 that Bryant was continuing the old tradition of declaring "Confederate Heritage Month" in April at the behest of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a proclamation that was not then routinely listed among others on the governor's website.</p>

<p>"I think it was a very brave action for this group to come out and burn this flag here in front of Governor Phil Bryant's mansion," Row said. "He is not just a proud member of Sons of Confederate Veterans; he also just won one of their awards. He is king white supremacy in Mississippi and this is making a direct statement to him as well as his followers, as well as letting him know, we see you."</p>

<p>Mississippi native Matt Salter said he attended the protest because he is planning to become a teacher in Mississippi and as an educator, he needs to be able to say he participated.</p>

<p>"If you're going to invest in the future of teaching kids, you have to have been involved in the process," Salter told the Jackson Free Press. "You have to have actually participated at least in some small way."</p>

<h2 id="lawmakersbarredfromchildmigrantfacilityinflorida">Lawmakers Barred from Child Migrant Facility in Florida</h2>

<p>HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson accused the Trump administration of a "cover-up" after officials denied him entry Tuesday to a detention center for migrant children in South Florida where he had hoped to survey living conditions.</p>

<p>Nelson and U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, both Florida Democrats, went to the contractor-run Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children following reports it was receiving detained migrant children who had arrived in the country illegally.</p>

<p>Wasserman Schultz said the facility was being used for an estimated 1,000 children, aged 13 to 17, who arrived here as unaccompanied minors as well as children separated from their families at the border. She said two other facilities in South Florida were being used for younger children.</p>

<p>"It is an affront as the senior senator of this state that an agency head would tell me that I do not have entrance into a federally funded facility where the lives and health of children are at stake," Nelson said.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump's immigration policies have come under intense scrutiny following reports of the forced separation of migrant children from their parents. Democrats and some Republicans are urging an end to the practice at the U.S.-Mexico border. Thousands of children split from their families at the U.S. southern border are being held in government-run facilities.</p>

<p>Wasserman Schultz said her staff had spoken Tuesday with the Florida-based company, Comprehensive Health Services, contracted to run the facility. She said her staff was told the lawmakers would be "welcomed warmly and allowed into the facility."</p>

<p>But Nelson said Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Eric Hargan told him it would take two weeks for them to get access.</p>

<p>"I think what they're doing is a cover-up for the president," Nelson said.</p>

<p>Trump doesn't like the negative response he's received, even from fellow Republicans, Nelson said.</p>

<p>"Are they abusing these kids? Are they sleeping on the floor? Are they in cages, like we've seen in some videos?" Wasserman Schultz asked after being barred from the building.</p>

<p>The Florida facility is overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Department spokesman Kenneth Wolfe said in an email Monday that it had reopened as "a temporary unaccompanied alien children program facility." He did not provide additional details.</p>

<p>An Associated Press reporter was denied access to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar while he was at a Miami hospital Tuesday to meet with opioid patients. Spokesman Gavin Smith barred the AP reporter from asking Azar questions about the immigration facility because an interview with the secretary had not been pre-arranged.</p>

<p>Several dozen children could be seen Tuesday morning playing soccer outside the building behind a chain link fence, mostly talking and shouting to each other in Spanish. Some did cartwheel flips while running across the field.</p>

<p>Reporters were not allowed onto the property. Security officials would not let reporters near the facility or provide details on conditions inside.</p>

<p>Martin Levine, from the Miami suburb of West Kendall, came to the facility with a sign showing a Nazi guard pulling a child away from woman with a Jewish star, and saying "Nazis took children away. Trump inhumane."</p>

<p>Levine said he believed the policy to separate families was immoral.</p>

<p>"This is not a Democrat or Republican issue, because all of the former first ladies have found this policy despicable," Levine said.</p>

<p>Republican lawmakers from Miami-Dade County have condemned the policy of separating families crossing the U.S. border.</p>

<p>Florida's other senator, Republican Marco Rubio, said in a tweet Tuesday, "Let's change the law so we can hold families together while awaiting expedited hearings."</p>

<p>JACKSON — Matthew Riley has been on the road a lot lately. As the state re-entry coordinator, Riley visited all 82 counties in Mississippi in the past nine months in search of employment opportunities for returning citizens leaving the state's corrections system.</p>

<p>He found mixed results, and the Mississippi Department of Corrections is hosting an all-day re-entry symposium on Thursday, June 21, to bring more stakeholders to the table to work on re-entry efforts. Riley said he is working on a survey for employers in the state to see if they have hired any ex-offenders.</p>

<p>"We had some good responses and ... after the symposium, we will come back and follow up with those employers we visited and ask them if anything has changed—asking if they hired anyone," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>MDOC staff members are in contact with some of the state's big employers like Nissan, Toyota and Ingalls Shipbuilding as well as other, smaller businesses. Riley is keeping a list of businesses statewide that will hire former inmates.</p>

<p>Riley was surprised that some mid-level employment positions are closed to ex-offenders due to rigorous requirements in state law. The casinos, which the Mississippi Gaming Commission governs, will not employ an ex-inmate, even in the restaurants or hotels. All casino employees have to go through extensive background checks, Riley said.</p>

<p>"I thought we had an opportunity to gain some ground for our men and women to go into hotels ... (but) that's out of the question. That really shocked me, particularly with the casino hotels and the restaurants," Riley said.</p>

<p>State law mandates that the executive director of the Gaming Commission "shall refuse to issue a work permit if the applicant has committed, attempted or conspired to commit a crime which is a felony in this state." MDOC currently has several vocational programs in its facilities, including welding and automotive programs. Riley said his goal is to identify mid-level career positions for ex-offenders, targeting companies that need the workforce.</p>

<p>"Mississippi offenders are an untapped workforce we are training in our facilities," Riley said.</p>

<p>Riley's big sell for companies unsure of hiring ex-inmates is the federal bonding program, a national incentive that provides protection for employers from loss of money or property for six months after they hire an ex-inmate. Riley is also educating employers about parole and probation. Mississippians on parole and probation are subject to drug testing and at times, other restrictions. He said those on parole or probation are already more accountable due to their required check-ins with an officer.</p>

<p>The re-entry symposium this week will bring subject-matter experts to the capital as well as policymakers, educators and health-care professionals, Riley said. MDOC needs community support to help with re-entry efforts, ultimately, due to lack of funding.</p>

<p>"We have no additional money for new programs," Commissioner Pelicia Hall said in a press release. "Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to make sure that we are teaching offenders what they need in the programs we have."</p>

<p>Indeed, MDOC cut off funding to county sheriff's departments after the legislative session this year, citing a budget deficit and the need to conserve funds. Lawmakers are aware of the budget shortfall in corrections in the state, but revenue collections are not likely to increase—many Democrats point to the 2016 tax cut that will pull even more funds from the state's coffers this fiscal year as the reason for this.</p>

<p>Even House Corrections Committee Chairman Bill Kinkade, R-Byhalia, admitted the challenges in corrections funding.</p>

<p>"The fact is we have funding issues in corrections. That's not a revelation to anybody," he said at the Capitol in April when sheriffs requested a hearing about their cut funds. "There have been some deficit-spending issues, and all of them haven't been addressed."</p>

<p>The state re-entry council has repeatedly handed off recommendations to lawmakers to ease re-entry for inmates, including provisions to not take away driver's licenses immediately upon arrest because inmates need identification to get a job upon release. The Legislature enacted a handful of criminal-justice reforms this year, including measures to stop judges and law-enforcement officials from stacking penalties on individuals as well as keeping judges from jailing men and women who cannot afford to pay their fines and fees.</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant vetoed another criminal-justice measure this year, however, that would have allowed inmates to keep their licenses (unless their offense was driving-related). Bryant said he vetoed the bill primarily because a provision would have required MDOC to determine whether an inmate is indigent before making him or her pay parole, probation or supervision fees. Mississippians on parole or probation must pay a monthly $55 fee; these fees account for an estimated $13.5 million in MDOC's budget. Citing budget concerns for the agency, Bryant vetoed the measure.</p>

<p>The re-entry symposium is Thursday, June 21, at Christ United Methodist Church in Jackson on Old Canton Road, at 9 a.m.</p>

<h2 id="editorsnoteamericawemuststopdehumanizingourchildren">EDITOR'S NOTE: America, We Must Stop De-humanizing Our Children</h2>

<p>Immigrants recently processed and released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection wait at the Catholic Charities RGV, Wednesday, June 20, in McAllen, Texas. Nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their families at the U.S. border over a six-week period during a crackdown on illegal entries, according to Department of Homeland Security figures obtained Friday by The Associated Press.

<p>Donna Ladd</p>

<p>As a child in the 1960s and 1970s, I was a bit of a freak of nature in my hometown of Philadelphia, Miss. You could call me sensitive or soft-hearted, or as the odd insult still goes, I had a bleeding heart. It broke me up (and still does) to see an animal hurt, and I felt human injustice deeply in my bones as early as elementary school.</p>

<p>Racial injustice was everywhere. Just about everyone around me of any age called black people by the n-word when I was a little kid, and the word "drunk" often preceded the word "Choctaw" for no apparent reason. The language of feigned superiority was like being blanketed with hate every day from all sorts of people calling other humans lazy, criminal animals by nature.</p>

<p>"They can't help it," some people, usually women, would add after one or another disparaging remark, often out of the blue and apropos of nothing.</p>

<p>By then, the slurs were whispered more often because unlike a decade before, white folks were more afraid to yell racially disparaging statements across parking lots or at people walking up to the courthouse to register to vote.</p>

<p>For reasons that are still unclear to me, I hated the ugly "prejudice," as we called it then, as early as third grade. Maybe I was born with neurons firing logic because it never made sense to me that a human being could be lesser than another based on the tone of their and their family's skin.</p>

<p>I started to speak up about it, and white adults would call me an n-lover (using the whole word). I guess that's when my skin began to toughen about speaking up about things that matter. I still don't insult easily, although many try, especially when I talk about racism. A white woman is just not supposed to do that, it seems. Sorry.</p>

<p>In a way I dodged a bullet, being only 3 when men I knew killed civil-rights workers Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner, and the media and FBI poured into town. The worst of white resistance was beaten down by the time I learned to properly write my name, and it was whimpering underground with at least a chance of dying out over time. Or at least that's what I hoped as I got older and learned more about my town, state and nation's brutal race history.</p>

<p>I have often wondered what my life would've been like had I come along 10, 20, 50 or 100 years sooner. Would I have attended those festive lynch-mob parties, or might I have put my life on the line alongside black civil-rights protesters? Would I have sat on the veranda in a hoop dress ignoring the brutality, or helped people get through the underground railroad? Would I have been one of those people who were complicit by doing nothing amid evil?</p>

<p>This week, many of us are encountering one after another person who is defending Donald Trump's horrendous policy of taking children from parents on the border and caging them. The defenders are swallowing Trump's ugly bait as so many adults around me did when I was a child, and as my ancestors must have as they owned slaves and their kids fought for the South.</p>

<p>Yes, they were taught many lies, just as people are now. Trump is using the same tactics of dehumanization of dark-skinned people that Mississippi's secession governor, John J. Pettus, did about slaves on the eve of the Civil War, and as Gov. Ross Barnett did about black citizens in the 1960s before we named a reservoir after him and threw up green signs on the interstate in his honor.</p>

<p>The language of racial and ethnic oppression is always about convincing willing participants that other groups of human beings are like animals, mongrels and predators who "infest" our nation, as Trump tweeted this week about migrants and asylum seekers trying to find safety and opportunity in the U.S. Since he announced for president by slurring Mexicans as rapists and murderers, while pushing lies about "black-on-white" crime, he has fed group bigotry to those apparently ready on some level to hear and embrace his "prejudice."</p>

<p>This week, Trump's apologists jabbed pitchforks at anyone daring to say that children do not deserve this treatment. They claim that breaking a law (which asylum seekers aren't) justifies arresting the parents and locking up the children. It's the families' fault that they put their kids at risk, you damn liberals, they yell at anyone who wants the babies out of the cages. You try to tell them that people like Barnett said breaking laws (like trying to vote or register at Ole Miss) justified what they did then, too. No, it's nothing like that, they declare.</p>

<p>Except that it is. So far, American history has cycled through dehumanization of whatever group the majority culture (usually white Protestants so far, let's be honest) has decided is inferior to good, hard-working people because they make bad decisions, or have a disorderly "culture," or their parents commit a misdemeanor to try to save their kids. People who dehumanize simply show no interest in the causes of the problems they blame entire groups for harboring in their ranks, much less the solutions.</p>

<p>They get a rush of superiority by judging "the other" without compassion or regard to the biblical teachings so many of them go on and on about.</p>

<p>Children have never been immune to this bigoted dehumanization; Hitler's goons killed Jewish babies with glee. Here in the U.S., slave children were stripped from their parents, with boys beaten by owners who often raped and impregnated young teen girls for their own pleasure and to produce new labor. (Call it long-range planning.) Native American children were stolen and put into boarding schools. Black boys, especially, have always felt threatening to many whites, studies show, accounting for why so many justify the killing of unarmed black children they deem "scary."</p>

<p>Horrendous crime policies were designed around the neo-conservative myth that young black and Hispanic boys made up a terrifying "super-predator" generation by nature, and those policies fueled mass incarceration and, ultimately, cycles of poverty, trauma and more violence.</p>

<p>Thus, it's not really a surprise that so many red-blood American white people are defending brown kids spending a few nights, or weeks, in cages—which are really just big chain-link rooms, they try to tell us. This dehumanization habit is embedded deep into our white DNA, and people like Trump purposefully trigger it with terrifying talk about MS-13 (which started in Los Angeles) and wild-eyed Mexicans coming for our women, just as the Ku Klux Klan and other racists ginned up fear of white women being raped to justify racism and violence.</p>

<p>That is exactly the way state bigotry has always worked—and it always will until we make it stop.</p>

<h2 id="runoffbluesinsidetheplayofftochallengerogerwicker">Run-Off Blues: Inside the Playoff to Challenge Roger Wicker</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p>Democratic U.S. Senate contenders David Baria and Howard Sherman share a common interest in basketball, at least for campaign metaphor purposes.</p>

<p>Speaking after a campaign lunch June 11 with state Democratic lawmakers at the King Edward Hotel in downtown Jackson, Baria compared the run-off election to the first game of the NBA finals, which turned the interaction between J.R. Smith and Lebron James into a meme overnight. The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors were tied with four seconds left, and Smith caught an offensive rebound. Instead of going back up to shoot and possibly end the game, he dribbled out of traffic and prompted the Cavs to take an off-balanced shot, forcing the game into overtime. The Cavs went on to lose the game.</p>

<p>"Did you see the first game of the NBA finals? One of the Cavs took a play off and it cost him, right?" Baria said speaking to reporters after the lunch. "Mississippians, you cannot afford to take a play off or a day off, so June the 26th is an opportunity for you to get out and vote for the right person for this job. Don't take a play off, OK?"</p>

<p>Sherman uses NBA basketball coaching to explain why he is running for office.</p>

<p>"I talk about it like a sports analogy, like the Cleveland Cavaliers before they got Tyronn Lue. Or the Warriors before Steve Kerr became the coach. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson were there," Sherman told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Lue joined the Cavs as head coach in 2016; Kerr became head coach at Golden State in 2014. Since 2015, the two teams have traded off being NBA champions, until this year when Golden State clinched its third championship in four years.</p>

<p>"When you put (in) the right leaders, you can re-shuffle the parts," Sherman said.</p>

<p>The June 26 run-off election is a bit like the final playoff game in a tied series. Both candidates are vying to be the Democratic challenger to Sen. Roger Wicker, who holds a strong 11-year grip on his Senate seat and is now the ranking Mississippi senator since Sen. Thad Cochran's retirement.</p>

<p>In the June 5 primary election, Sherman brought in 713 more votes than Baria. Both candidates received 31 percent of the total votes cast, however, forcing the two to a run-off. This means that 37 percent of voters who did not choose either candidate initially can sway the election on June 26.</p>

<p>The Making of a Run-off</p>

<p>Turnout in the June 6 primary was higher than it was in 2014 by about 2,000 votes with 87,931 Mississippians casting a Democratic primary ballot. Baria and Sherman are working to swing voters who account for the nearly 32,000 ballots cast that were not for either candidate.</p>

<p>Delreco Harris State Rep. David Baria, also an attorney, says he is running for the U.S. Senate for his kids and the next generation of Mississippians.</p>

<p>Rep. Omeria Scott, D-Laurel, had filed her candidacy papers just before the deadline on March 1. Scott, a longtime lawmaker from Laurel, Miss., and former chairwoman of the Legislative Black Caucus in the Mississippi Legislature, came in a solid third place in the June 5 primary, receiving more then 20,000 votes. Scott, a colleague of Baria's in the House, endorsed Sherman just a few days later.</p>

<p>Scott, flanked Sherman and wife, Sela Ward, outside the city hall in Laurel called on Democrats to unite around the California native in the run-off election on June 8, Facebook live recordings show.</p>

<p>"Howard has met the criteria that has been articulated by the Democratic leadership in the state," Scott said, listing off some members by name who want a candidate who can raise money and who is electable.</p>

<p>"He (Sherman) came from the bottom to leading in the first leg of the primary," Scott said.</p>

<p>She endorsed Sherman on June 8, but when asked to elaborate on her decision for this story, she declined, deferring to the Sherman campaign's press release.</p>

<p>Many of the Democratic House members endorsed Baria early rather than Scott. His Twitter account was laden with photographs of lawmakers and their endorsements in the days leading up to the primary. On June 11, several Democratic state lawmakers met in downtown Jackson to strategize about getting their delegations to vote for Baria in the upcoming run-off. Baria leads the Democratic caucus in the Mississippi House of Representatives.</p>

<p>"I think it's fair enough to say that there are people who may not have been involved, even some members," Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, the vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said on June 11. "The first time we had another member running. This time we have one member running. This time I think there's going to be a more cohesive group of people working and doing it with a whole lot more energy."</p>

<p>The Legislative Black Caucus endorsed Baria before the end of that week.</p>

<p>Chairwoman Rep. Sonya Williams-Barnes, D-Gulfport, said she is working hard to ensure record-breaking turnout numbers for the run-off on June 26. Williams-Barnes' district is also on the Mississippi Coast, where Baria lives and is from originally. Williams-Barnes endorsed Baria personally as well.</p>

<p>"David is a man of his word. If he says he's going to do something, he does it, and if he finds out he can't, he's man enough to come back and say things will be different," she told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>After the Legislative Black Caucus endorsed Baria, the Associated Press called Scott, who said no one asked her about the group's endorsement.</p>

<p>The Businessman ...</p>

<p>The two candidates share some qualities: Both have had long, successful careers as an entrepreneur and a trial attorney, respectively. Both candidates are good at politicking, using their influence whether that be in the statehouse or Hollywood to gain ground in an election. The two candidates diverge, however, at their approach to the senator's job based on their experiences.</p>

<p>Sherman, 63, is a venture capitalist and entrepreneur who has made his career in the health-care technology business. He brings his business mentality into the room with him. When he met this reporter for an interview at Banner Hall, he walked right in to Lemuria and asked to use a private office for the interview, citing his relationship with the owners. Sherman worked with a Nobel Prize winner on technology to help prevent American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan from overheating in desert temperatures. Then he worked with a Michigan-based company on technology to keep bodies warm during surgeries, without pumping hot air over them, as is common practice.</p>

<p>Delreco Harris</p>

<p>"I get asked all the time what's the number-one trait of an entrepreneur, and it has to be great peripheral vision," he told the Jackson Free Press. "I was trying to help my friend get funding to help us all (stay) safe. The next thing you know I'm in the health-care business."</p>

<p>Born and raised in California, the son of an Eastern European immigrant mother was raised in a Democratic family, going with them to knock on doors for JFK.</p>

<p>Sherman voted as a Republican in California elections around 2000, because California Democrats got "anti-business," he said. He continued to vote as a Democrat in national elections during that time, however, and after he moved to Meridian, Miss., full-time, he disagreed with Mississippi Republicans. He drafted a 100-day plan he released this month and his anecdotes shared in his full interview (see jfp.ms/sherman) indicate that he understands the business side of politics. That has included giving campaign donations to candidates in order to seal funding for research and projects he was involved in.</p>

<p>The entrepreneur, who said he prefers jeans and a T-shirt to his campaign suit, does not believe being a Mississippi native is an important component of the campaign.</p>

<p>"The voters voted a week and a half ago, and they said we're going to pick the guy who wasn't born here because his ideas are better," he said. "(Voters said my) view of the future is better, and if they vote for him because he was born here then you're not going to wind up with these ideas."</p>

<p>Sherman has access to a network of Hollywood powerhouses, demonstrated by Robert de Niro and Alec Baldwin hosting a New York fundraiser for him in May. He also has access to his own personal funds. He has loaned his campaign $650,000 and hired the Doug Jones campaign team of Joe Trippi and Giles Perkins (Jones' campaign manager) to run his own. They are also running Democrat Mike Espy's campaign to fill Sen. Thad Cochran's vacated seat.</p>

<p>... vs. The Lawmaker</p>

<p>David Baria, 55, is banking on his experience as a lawmaker and his track record to secure the Democratic spot on the November ballot. When Baria met with this reporter for an interview in his glass-walled Baria-Jones law firm in Jackson, he was finishing up emails for what he calls "dialing for dollars" for the campaign.</p>

<p>His success as an attorney only translates to a certain point when it comes to raising campaign finances. Baria, who has a long history of donating to the Democratic Party and PACs in federal elections, lives on the Gulf Coast where he lost his home during Hurricane Katrina and soon his first son to an unexpected illness. As leader of the House Minority Caucus, he has had to wage losing battle after losing battle against a staunch Republican supermajority.</p>

<p>"I'm not telling anybody that we have been successful with our requests of the speaker (Philip Gunn) because we haven't, but we get heard. We do have input from time to time, and what I have learned in my time as leader is what (former U.S. Sen.) Trent Lott said is right. It's like herding cats because you have 47 individually strong personalities. You have to have a strong personality and an ego to get elected," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>David Baria for Senate Campaign</p>

<p>Winning several narrow elections in both the Mississippi Senate and House with Republican finances and endorsements against him, Baria is no stranger to being the underdog. His approach to the job is informed by his experience leading the minority caucus, his full interview with the Jackson Free Press (jfp.ms/baria) shows.</p>

<p>"My style of leadership is not to say, 'Here's what I think we ought to do, what do you think?' I say, 'Here's the problem, let's discuss,' and I take what folks say to me and try to synthesize it and then I try to make the best decision going forward," Baria told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>As the career lawmaker in the run-off election, he is reliant on his political experience and knowledge of policy matters from the Capitol. He has raised about $250,000 in donations and is working with Chism Strategies for his campaign. His law partner, Brandon Jones, is his campaign manager.</p>

<p>About the Tax Cut</p>

<p>Sherman and Baria agree that the recent GOP tax cut in Congress benefitted corporations and the wealthy the most—and that it did little to stimulate the U.S. economy. The two candidates have differing views on what could be done next, though. Sherman, who studied economics at Claremont McKenna College, says all fiscal policy is designed to achieve an objective. The only one that the GOP tax cut achieved, he said, was to benefit corporations.</p>

<p>"So if they had said, 'What do we need? Where do we want them to direct that money?' Because a lot of (corporations) just bought their stock back. A lot of them bonused out CEOs, and they bought yachts from Italy—well that didn't help the economy at all," Sherman said.</p>

<p>He said that if lawmakers had specifically targeted places that companies had to locate businesses—like the Delta—then they could have given them the tax cut.</p>

<p>"Had they said ... 'Pick a plighted part of the state, if you put a plant there in the Delta where unemployment is high, we will give you a tax cut.' But if you just are simply going to rebuy your stock back, it didn't do anything for the economy. I'm not saying I'm anti the tax cut; I'm anti an unfocused tax cut," Sherman said.</p>

<p>Baria sees the GOP tax cut as "nothing more than a payback for Republican donors who donated to the president." He noted that the tax cuts for the middle class are temporary, while the corporate tax cuts are permanent.</p>

<p>"I think if you want to do real tax reform that will stimulate our economy, then you give a big tax cut to middle-class America," he said. "Those folks will take that money and improve their lives by buying a new refrigerator, buying a new car, buying a new house, and that stimulates the economy," he said in his interview.</p>

<p>Baria said that rolling back the tax cuts for the wealthy would free up funds to use on transportation or education.</p>

<p>Immigration in Focus</p>

<p>As the Trump administration continues to separate children from their parents at the southern border, immigration is increasingly becoming an issue that Congress might act on in the future. Both Democratic Senate candidates believe that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, immigrants deserve a path to citizenship or an extension of their status.</p>

<p>Sherman said immigration should be a focus point.</p>

<p>"If we have a shortage of nurses, then let's say, 'Hey, guess what? We'll bring in 10,000 nurses.' But if we have an over-abundance of construction workers and there are already people having a hard time finding (a job), then maybe we don't bring in a ton of construction workers," he told the Jackson Free Press. "I want to bring in—I don't know what the right number is—if it's 100,000 or whatever, but maybe we can do it in a way where we don't create a problem by trying to solve a problem."</p>

<p>At one point, Democrats in Congress were considering a compromise that allowed a path to citizenship for DACA recipients in exchange for Trump's border wall. Sherman noted the budget deficit when speaking about the wall.</p>

<p>"And the border wall, you know, we're in such a deficit to begin with. I haven't seen the data that shows me that that's going to really keep us safe," Sherman said. "We do need to be kept safe; all it takes is one person getting through, and we're in jeopardy."</p>

<p>Baria said the concept of the border wall is ridiculous, however.</p>

<p>"What we need is an effective means of securing our border with a combination of wall, fence, live security, cameras—a combination of those things, which I think pretty much already exists," he said. "Could it be improved? Yes. But the Great Wall of China along our southern border is a ridiculous expenditure of money, and it is nothing more than a political ploy."</p>

<p>Baria says the U.S. needs to revamp the entire immigration system and expressed concerns about the cost-effectiveness of locking people up or deporting those who are not criminals.</p>

<p>"... I don't think that it is cost-effective to deport every single person who is here without proper documentation," he said. "If someone is here without proper documentation and we pick them up because they have committed a crime, I'm for deporting them. ... There should be probably some level of crime that we define above which they get deported, below which they do not, (like) speeding."</p>

<p>Doug Jones Effect?</p>

<p>What will matter more in the June 26 run-off could come down to money and people-power—or both. Pam Shaw, political director of the Baria campaign, emphasizes their ground game with Mississippians.</p>

<p>"One of the things we're confident of is that people trump dollars. We will have the people; we will not have the dollars," Shaw said in Jackson on June 11. "But this election cannot be won by dollars alone."</p>

<p>Sherman hired the Doug Jones team to run his campaign, which helped Alabama elect a Democrat to the Senate in a solidly red state. His victory is seen as a part of the wave of candidates and seats "flipping" around the country in the wake of President Donald Trump's election. So far, Sherman has paid Trippi's team more than $490,000 for media and political consulting services, FEC filings show.</p>

<p>Howard Sherman for Senate Campaign</p>

<p>In an interview with Ezra Klein of Vox after the Jones victory, Trippi talked about the campaign's strategies.</p>

<p>"Trump's creating energy among the Democratic base that wants to come out and wants to make the change and wants to do something to fight back against what's happening. At the same time, he's creating enough chaos and divisiveness and hostility that Republicans who would never ordinarily vote for a Democrat say, 'OK, well, I've got all the chaos and hostility I can handle right now. I'll vote for somebody who wants to try to find common ground and get things done for me, even if they're a Democrat,'" Trippi told Klein.</p>

<p>Giles Perkins, who ran Jones' campaign, is also running Sherman's. Perkins was not made available to the Jackson Free Press for an interview by press time.</p>

<p>Rickey Cole, the former chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party, says turnout is typically very low in non-presidential election years for federal primary elections. Cole said often times voters will not select a candidate they have not heard of or turn out to vote unless they are given a reason to do so.</p>

<p>While Cole is not privy to either Sherman or Baria campaigns, he said it appeared that the Sherman campaign did a good job of identifying likely voters in the primary election. Baria or Scott could have had the best shot at name recognition going into the primary, but Cole, who is supporting Baria, pointed out it would be limited at best.</p>

<p>"There are 122 House seats, and so, at best, David and Omeria had been on the ballot for 1/122 of the population in the state of Mississippi," he said. "... (That's) less than 1 percent state ID-recognition."</p>

<p>"I think a successful campaign has to overlay the geography with the virtual in order to be successful," Cole said.</p>

<p>More than 21,000 Mississippians are behind bars, and 34,000 more people are on probation or parole. Returning citizens go back to their communities looking for work, and true reform comes from people across the state offering second chances to the many Mississippians who need and deserve support after serving their time.

<p>This week the Mississippi Department of Corrections will host a re-entry symposium in Jackson, a necessary step to re-engage stakeholders involved with the criminal justice system, from lawmakers and mental-health professionals to judges and experts.</p>

<p>Mississippi tried criminal-justice reform for a while, following the 2014 reforms the Legislature passed, but now as financial resources dwindle, MDOC is forced to reach out to community organizations in search for help. Conversations across industries are important, but how about some action?</p>

<p>More than 21,000 Mississippians are behind bars, and 34,000 more people are on probation or parole. Returning citizens go back to their communities looking for work, and true reform comes from people across the state offering second chances to the many Mississippians who need and deserve support after serving their time.</p>

<p>While Republican and Democratic lawmakers have found bipartisan progress in supporting reform measures, that support must trickle down to neighborhoods. Reforms work best in transparent and honest environments, which is where local government and law enforcement come into play.</p>

<p>In Jackson, the City has yet to implement a meaningful program to help returning citizens find work, despite promises to do so. The officer-identification task force has been underway to work on issues of transparency in the Jackson Police Department, but the members have promised to get a recommendation to the mayor by early August and have not yet begun writing policy.</p>

<p>Those who deal with every aspect of the law from mayors and police chiefs to district attorneys and lawmakers need to fix wait times in jails, find workable solutions to the roots of crime, job opportunities for returning citizens, and initiatives that demonstrate that all of the aforementioned entities don't just have to come in contact with people in handcuffs or behind bars.</p>

<p>David Baria knew he was fighting an uphill battle when he decided to run for U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker's long-held Senate seat. Baria's first challenge, however, is securing the Democratic spot on the November ballot. He faces entrepreneur Howard Sherman in a run-off election on June 26, after coming in second in the Democratic primary earlier this month.</p>

<p>Baria, a longtime state lawmaker, is not daunted by his odds. He readily admits that funding has been a struggle, and he knew that from the get-go. Wicker has more than $3.4 million in cash on-hand, even after launching a targeted campaign against state Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ellisville, before he switched to the special election. Baria, a trial attorney by trade who fought tort reform when it came to the state, has served at the Mississippi Capitol for 10 years. The Jackson Free Press sat down with him at the Baria-Jones law office in downtown Jackson last week for about 40 minutes.</p>

<p>What motivated you to get into this race? Is there a moment or a story that led you to make that decision?</p>

<p>I don't think there's a moment. I think there's a series of moments that led me to get into the race for the U.S. Senate—and a series of decisions that I think were very, very poor decisions made by our leadership here at the State Capitol and in Washington. If I had to point to the most important reason why I'm in this race, he's sitting right there at the end of the table (Editor's note: his son, Max, was sitting inside the conference room for a few minutes.), and I have two daughters, one of whom has just graduated from college, and the other one of whom is in college. So what I mean is, that not just for my kids but for everybody's children and our grandchildren, we've got to do something right now. The time has never been more appropriate to make some changes so that we can change the trajectory of our state. I want to be a part of that; I did when I first ran. You know, working in the Mississippi Legislature has been a very good experience, and at times it's a positive experience, and I have had successes there, but it can be very frustrating because I see our leadership make decisions that keep us in 50th place.</p>

<p>So, now that you're in a run-off, has your strategy changed at all for these three weeks? Or are you going to do more of what you've been doing?</p>

<p>Our strategy really hasn't changed. I think we had a very good strategy, which was to take somewhat limited resources, and when I say that, I'm very thankful that we've been able to raise and spend $300,000, which is really phenomenal for a Democrat in Mississippi during a two-month span, that's essentially what we're talking about. So I'm very proud of that, but when you're up against someone with what appears to be unlimited resources, then suddenly your resources don't seem to be as bountiful as they might otherwise. But what we're going to do and continue to do is to focus our resources on places that we believe the most Democratic votes are going to come from. We were fairly targeted; there were a lot of counties that we just weren't able to get to (before June 5). We had a different strategy for reaching those counties. One thing we are doing a little differently is I'm circling around to some of the counties that I didn't actually have a presence in—meaning I didn't go there, I didn't have an event there, I didn't visit there.</p>

<p>I made calls, and I called someone in every county before June 5, but now we're going to some places where we didn't really get to visit. What I found in looking at the data from the primary is that where I visited and where I had an on-the-ground presence, we did very well. And where I didn't, we did not do as well. So we're making a concerted effort to get the vote back out—our vote back out. And in addition to that, take some votes that may have voted for Rep. Scott, some votes that may have voted for the other gentleman, my opponent, and even create some new votes—folks that didn't go to the polls on the 5th—and we're doing that in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>I'm fundraising because I don't have the ability to write myself a huge check, so I'm spending some time ... dialing for dollars, which is the least fun part of this entire thing. I enjoy campaigning. I enjoy getting in the car with Matt (a campaign worker) and Pam (campaign political director), and going to an event and speaking before a bunch of people I've never met before. It's perverse, I know, but I enjoy that.</p>

<p>Part of what I've looked at is campaign donations and expenditures, but also where you've donated money in federal elections before. I was hoping you could comment on your contributions to the American Association for Justice PAC and other Democratic PACS.</p>

<p>I don't know what you mean; I put my money where my interests lie and where I think that folks are trying to improve the situation for folks who don't have a voice otherwise. That's ... what's guided my professional life, that's ... what's guided my political life, and I think you'll find I've been pretty consistent in that regard. Where I've spent my professional time outside of actually representing people, I just rotated off the board of United Policyholders, which I was very proud to be a part of for four, five, six years. That's a group that is an insurance, policy-holder, consumer advocate (group). I didn't get paid for that. I traveled at my own expense, and my time was at my own expense, but that's where my passion lies—in trying to help folks who might not otherwise have the ability to help themselves.</p>

<p>You were a strong advocate against tort reform, and I'm wondering how you think that's affected Mississippi, specifically when it comes to fundraising and "dialing for dollars."</p>

<p>It's impacted Mississippi in a number of different ways, but the biggest pitch that was made for tort reform was that you couldn't attract businesses to the state of Mississippi because we were a judicial hell hole, and that if we would just (enact) tort reform, then we would see a dramatic increase (in) job growth. If you will track Governor Barbour's statements from 2003 to today, you can see that job growth in Mississippi is flat. While we are always happy to promote companies that come to the state and open up new business and create new jobs, we had just as many companies fold their tent and go elsewhere. So the job growth never materialized, and the trade-off to me was too important to make, and that is folks that are catastrophically injured have a cap on the damages that they can recover.</p>

<p>I know firsthand, because I have represented people in this situation, when there's a cap on the damages, you never get to the cap, so it has decreased the settlement value of cases, and that is not a good thing for anybody but insurance companies. It doesn't help the person who is catastrophically injured because they have less money that they can recover in those cases.</p>

<p>Now, I would say that in terms of a perception standpoint that it's probably been a good thing because people may not think of us in the way that we were portrayed by the pro-tort-reformers. And they spent a lot of money portraying Mississippi as a terrible place to do business or practice medicine, so that was created, but at least with the passage of some of those tort reform measures, that part has gone away. But I don't think you've seen an influx of doctors since tort reform, and as I said before, you haven't seen an influx of businesses or jobs; and in fact, what you've seen since 2013 is a decrease in people locating in Mississippi, including young people your age and younger who are leaving the state in droves—so something is wrong here, and tort reform didn't fix it.</p>

<p>You've campaigned against the GOP tax reform bill that passed. Could you explain why you are against it, and what it does or does not do for individuals (in your opinion).</p>

<p>So let's talk about the federal GOP tax bill, Trump's tax bill if you will. I believe that that tax cut was nothing more than a payback for Republican donors who donated to the president. And we gave permanent, significant tax cuts to corporations that had, for years, offshored their businesses, offshored their profits and offshored their employees without asking anything from them in return.</p>

<p>The 1 percent got an enormous tax cut, which they did not need, and theirs is permanent. The middle class got a modest tax cut, which is temporary. I think that's upside down. I think if you want to do real tax reform that will stimulate our economy, then you give a big tax cut to middle class America. Those folks will take that money and improve their lives by buying a new refrigerator, buying a new car, buying a new house, and that stimulates the economy. Because if GE has to make more refrigerators, they've got to make more parts, they've got to hire more people. That leads to economic activity.</p>

<p>I just think the concept was wrong, and in addition to that, the way we paid for this tax cut was to increase the debt, which I thought every Republican in Washington said was a terrible thing to do when President Obama was in office. And the other thing they are already talking about doing is cutting Social Security and cutting Medicare. It's just wrong at every level. Now I won't argue with ... a middle-class person who says, "Well I'm getting an extra $500 in my check every month, is that a bad thing?" No, that's not a bad thing. You should be getting more. You should get more of the tax relief, and corporations should get less and the 1 percent should get none. And look, there are so many loopholes, if you really want to do tax relief, take the loopholes out. The effective rate that corporations were paying was already down around 16 or 18 percent with loopholes, so if you wanted to create a proper rate for them but eliminate loopholes, okay, I can see that. (Editor's note: While all corporations are subject to a 35-percent federal income tax rate, only half of those companies pay that full percentage, a recent study found.) But we didn't do any of that hard work. We just gave money to corporations—many of which were offshore—and to the very wealthy.</p>

<p>What would be your priorities for immigration reform? And specifically, there have been discussions about a compromise with a border wall for DACA. More recently, we have a (Jeff) Sessions decree saying you can't seek asylum as a domestic violence victim or if you're wanted by a gang. So what would you prioritize?</p>

<p>This is a complex issue, so I'm not going to give you some simple sound bite, and if you want my full response, get your hand ready. First of all, the concept of a border wall that runs the length of our border with Mexico is ridiculous. What we need is an effective means of securing our border with a combination of wall, fence, live security, cameras—a combination of those things, which I think pretty much already exists. Could it be improved? Yes. But the Great Wall of China along our southern border is a ridiculous expenditure of money, and it is nothing more than a political ploy.</p>

<p>So I don't agree with that, but I understand what you mentioned about Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi offering to agree to the wall in exchange for DACA. You know, DACA is important, those folks who are part of DACA, I think it stands for Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals, and these are kids who came to our country. You can't choose your parents. These kids came to our country, and we put certain restrictions or requirements on them. The kids who are here on DACA are meeting those requirements. They've upheld their end of the bargain. They are in school, or they have jobs, and they are paying taxes. This is what we should want from an immigration system, so DACA should be extended, and we're talking about a finite group of people that this applies to. These people will age through the system and become productive adults hopefully, that's the idea, but it's not a program that is continually open to new Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. It's a finite group of people. ...</p>

<p>I think that we need to revamp our entire immigration system. I think it is fraught with problems. I hear stories about people who try to do it the right way, and they stand in line metaphorically for years, and then you have folks who swim across the river, and they're here. That's not fair, and I understand that, but I don't think that it is cost-effective to deport every single person who is here without proper documentation. If someone is here without proper documentation, and we pick them up because they have committed a crime, I'm for deporting them. I have no problem with that whatsoever. There should be probably some level of crime that we define above which they get deported, or below which they do not (get deported, like) speeding, I don't know. But the other thing that is critically important to me, and I think it should be to all Americans, is that we don't separate families when we can help it. If someone commits a murder and they're here undocumented, then they (have) got to go. But we can't snatch children out of mama's arms at the border as a deterrent to folks trying to get into our country illegally. We've got to figure out a better system than that.</p>

<p>And the final thing is the piece that Jeff Sessions recently said about ending asylum for victims of domestic violence. I heard a very poignant story this morning on The Daily. They interviewed a woman from Burkina Faso, and she went through the story of her life and how her family essentially took a dowry, and then she belonged to her husband in her country and then he beat her all the time. He constantly humiliated her in public and made her life a living hell, and you know, if we can't be a place that accepts folks from other countries under such circumstances, then we're not the America I thought we were.</p>

<p>What is your stance on abortion rights?</p>

<p>Fair question. I didn't vote on the latest iteration (15-week abortion ban bill). I wasn't there. I was campaigning. There was another bill in 2014 (20-week abortion ban bill) I think that I didn't vote on; I'm not sure why. I don't know whether I wasn't there. I don't know whether I was in court, but I didn't vote on the bill, which I might look back and say there was a reason. ... There was an amendment to that bill offered by Rep. (Toby) Barker that I know I would have voted for if I was there because it provided exceptions to the 20-week bar in cases of rape, incest, health of the mother. I know I would have voted for that if I was there, so I was either off the floor or away from the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>But here's my position: I think abortion should remain safe and legal, so that we don't have a situation where only wealthy women are capable, because of their wealth, of getting an abortion by flying to some country where it's legal. I think that this should be a woman's right to make that decision, in consultation with her family and her physician. I have two daughters, whom I referenced earlier. If some crazed psycho killer raped one of them, then we should have the right as a family to make the decision whether we want to bring that baby to full-term or not. No one should take away that right.</p>

<p>Now, could there be some limitations on when you should terminate a pregnancy? Yes. I don't know what that should be. I'm not a doctor, nor will I ever get pregnant, but I think that we should let science dictate what that limit ought to be. And there absolutely ought to be exceptions to that limit for rape, incest, viability of the fetus, health of the mother. ... There ought to be exceptions if we're going to have a bright-line rule on a certain number of weeks.</p>

<p>What national criminal-justice reforms do you think Mississippi could benefit from the most? What, on a national level, can you do to help make that a reality?</p>

<p>You could end mandatory-minimum sentencing, particularly for drug crimes. This (currently) takes the discretion away from a judge and ends up with results that sometimes in retrospect appear to be unfair and just odd. And so I believe in electing good judges and letting judges have the discretion in any particular case, based on the facts of that case. We have far too many people who have been convicted of nonviolent drug offenses who are rotting in our prisons. And let's make no mistake about it, it is much more expensive to construct, to maintain and to operate a maximum-security prison than it is (to maintain) a community-based facility with less security.</p>

<p>I'm a criminal-justice major from (the University of) Southern Mississippi. In 1984, I had the privilege of going on the British studies program, and I studied at the University of London. And I studied the British criminal-justice system, and we toured prisons all over London and all over the countryside, and at the end of that program, I was required to write a paper. And I chose to write about community-based sentencing, and I've been in this place where I'm at now since 1984 because no one has convinced me that I'm wrong.</p>

<p>And that is, we ought to do more community-based sentencing for nonviolent drug offenders primarily, so that we don't remove them from their families and from their communities, but we punish them within those communities. We allow for more visits; we allow more freedom. So they can work on public beautification, picking up litter or whatever, but that they serve their sentences in a less restrictive environment because we shouldn't be in fear of them hurting us. They weren't convicted of a violent crime. I think that that is less expensive, more humane and a better way to re-integrate people back into society, and that's the goal of our system, is to rehabilitate people. So if that's really our goal, that's the best way to do it. Now, I'm not talking about murderers and rapists, those folks can go to Parchman. I'm talking about folks that have committed nonviolent, primarily drug crimes.</p>

<p>In the Legislature I watched you have a bargaining presence on the House side when it came to the education-funding-formula re-write, but if you were to go to the Senate, education policies that trickle down to the states are very different. So what, at a federal level, would you want to do for education? </p>

<p>I don't think that all the Title I money that is supposed to be coming to states is coming to states, and these take care of schools in underserved areas. And I don't think that all of the money that's coming to SPED (special education) that should be coming through SPED is coming to SPED, so that's a federal, congressional issue.</p>

<p>Here's what we could do in addition to those two things: You could roll back the corporate tax cuts and the cuts for the 1 percent, and you could send billions of dollars to the states that they could use for teacher-pay raises and to upgrade school infrastructure. You know, in our education budget, there's a lot of federal dollars already, but we could use more, and that's a way to get more money to states that are in need—and Mississippi's education system is in need.</p>

<p>If you go down to the coast, we have bright, shiny, relatively new schools because of Katrina, but if you go to Carroll County, it's raining on your head when you go into classrooms, in some of them. If you go to the bathroom there, two of the toilets, you can't use them. They try to keep it clean, but it's falling down around their ears, and that's a shame, and I hate to pick on Carroll County, but that's an example of a school I have visited and seen with my own eyes.</p>

<p>How has leading the Democratic caucus in the House changed your perspective about the political process or informed how you're running this campaign and what you would do as a senator?</p>

<p>I went to law school with the speaker, and we weren't best friends, but we were friends in law school. When I first got to the House of Representatives, he greeted me warmly and said you know, 'I know you're a smart guy, and I'm looking forward to working with you and I'm going to put you to work.' And I was elated, (I thought), "This is going to be great. We're going to be able to work across the aisle and get stuff done." That is not how things started off, and frankly, that's not how it's gone. But you know, while we started off kind of rocky because of some bills they tried to run through that we objected to, and we did a lot of bill reading and kind of slowed things down for a while to get an ear, since those days, we have been talking regularly.</p>

<p>I'm not telling anybody that we have been successful with our requests of the speaker, because we haven't, but we get heard. We do have input from time to time, and what I have learned in my time as leader is what Trent Lott said is right. It's like herding cats because you have 47 individually strong personalities. You have to have a strong personality and an ego to get elected. And you are responsible to your voters, so you have your own little area of responsibility, but yet, you're being asked to be a part of the group and cede some of that responsibility for the better of the group or the better of the policy issue at hand. It's a difficult management issue, but I think I've done a good job with it. Organizing and preparing for what is coming to us in a committee or on the floor in any particular day takes some time and energy. It takes a lot of help, so I have to be able to talk to folks who are on my team about how we're going to work through this problem.</p>

<p>And my style of leadership is not to say, "Here's what I think we ought to do. What do you think?" I say, "Here's the problem; let's discuss," and I take what folks say to me and try to synthesize it, and then I try to make the best decision going forward. And folks might not always agree with it, but they feel like they've been heard. Developing or honing those skills is going to be invaluable to me as I move forward. Working in an environment where you have to take into account what other people think and feel all the time is invaluable to me. I'm not coming from the perspective of a CEO. I'm not running for president, and I'm not running for governor. I'm running to be a member a 100-member body, and as a member of the super minority in the Mississippi Legislature, we can't get anything done without reaching across the aisle and getting Republican help. Whether that's passing something we want to pass or beating a bad bill, we have to have help.</p>

<p>So I've been there 11 years. I've built some relationships with some people that other people might look at and go, "Why are these two friends?" or "Why is he friends with her?" I will give you an example. I have filed a bill to create gender equality in terms of pay since 2013—five years now. The last two years, I have gotten help on that bill from Rep. Becky Currie, who is a staunch, probably Tea Party Republican, that is probably how she would describe herself. But we worked together on that and on other issues because we built relationships. You can't walk into a body like (the Legislature) in the super minority and say, "This is what I want to do, let's pass it this year." It will never happen. You have to work it over time, year after year, building relationships and trust, and those skills and that experience is going to serve me in Washington.</p>

<p>Mississippi is one of the poorest and unhealthiest states. Identify the top health-care reforms that you think could benefit the state the most. What decision do you think that the Senate and eventually Congress could make that could benefit Mississippians' health care and overall health?</p>

<p>(There are) two immediate things we could do. You could take the ACA, if you wanted to keep that legislation around, and there are some objections to it because it sort of forces people to buy insurance. And I frankly have a personal issue with forcing anybody to buy anything, whether it's car insurance or health insurance, but the ACA is here, and one of the things we could do is impose a requirement on states to expand Medicaid. Because we took the federal subsidy for a disproportionate share of uncompensated care away, so you're pulling the rug out from underneath them and not replacing it if you don't expand Medicaid.</p>

<p>So you could mandate that states do that, and I think that 37 states, maybe 38 after Virginia, have already done that. (Editor's Note: 34 states have expanded Medicaid, including Virginia, according to Families USA.) Mississippi could still do that voluntarily if we had leadership that wanted to do that. Look at Louisiana, after they elected John Bel Edwards, they expanded Medicaid, and that's helped Louisianans—so we could do it (too). But why not just say at the federal level, we made a mistake when we wrote this. The Supreme Court says we didn't make it mandatory; let's make it mandatory, and that would be a big step in the right direction.</p>

<p>The other thing we could look at is scrapping the ACA and enacting some sort of legislation that requires a basic minimum level of health care, maintenance health care for everybody. I don't care what you call it, but you know you could do that and then folks who had really good health insurance policies could keep that if they wanted to, but you would be providing basic health care for citizens who don't have it now.</p>

<p>And the group we are talking about, they are not the poorest of the poor because they are already on Medicaid. We are talking about the working poor. These are sometimes single moms with kids who work two jobs, but neither job provides health insurance and they can't afford to buy health insurance and put food in their kids' stomachs and put the roof over their heads. And those people, they get health care, but they get it sometimes when it's critical—so where do they go to get it? They go to the emergency room where health care costs five times as much, and folks who have insurance end up paying for it. That's a bad system.</p>

<p>We already get a lot of federal transportation funds, but do you have ideas to free up more federal dollars for states?</p>

<p>I definitely think we need more federal money for infrastructure, and I thought that's what President Trump was saying in 2016 when he ran on fixing our crumbling infrastructure. This is the right thing to do for two reasons. One, our infrastructure is falling apart. We have bridges falling down, we have bridges we have to close because they are impassable, we have roads that will tear out the bottom of our car. If we are going to continue to be a world leader, we need state-of-the-art infrastructure, and that's not just roads and bridges, but that's our power grid, our water and sewage systems, that's our Internet system—all of it.</p>

<p>The other reason we need to do it is because it creates jobs. This is investing in ourselves. This just makes sense on every level, but the proposal that came out of Washington, or the president I should say, was upside down. He proposed 20 percent coming out of Washington, and 80 percent coming from state and local governments. If our state and local governments had that much of the need met already, they'd be doing the work because they have to answer to their voters every day in their districts. So you've got to flip that percentage. You've got to keep TIGER (Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery) grants in place, and you have to have the money to do it.</p>

<p>Now this is something that I wouldn't mind increasing the debt a little bit to get done, because I think it would pay off in the long run through job creation and additional taxes being paid. But to me, the first step would be, again, to roll back the tax cut for the 1 percent and corporate America—leave the middle class in place. You would raise billions of dollars simply by doing those rollbacks, and then take some of that money, most of that money perhaps, and put it into a national infrastructure program where the feds pay 80 percent, and the state and local governments are paying the 20 percent.</p>

<p>What are you doing to engage young people to vote in this run-off?</p>

<p>Not enough. It's difficult to engage any age person in a run-off; you know the primaries in Mississippi in nonpresidential years just don't get much of a turnout. In 2014, the last time the Senate was on the ballot in a nonpresidential year, 83,000 Democrats turned out to vote. This year we had 87 or 88,000, so a bit of a tick up, and in a runoff you always have a drop. (Editor's note: In 2014, 85,866 Mississippians cast a Democratic ballot. In 2018, 87,931 Mississippians cast a Democratic ballot in the primary.) So could we do more to engage young voters? Absolutely.</p>

<p>One of the things I would like to see us do as a state is to give young people the opportunity to go to two-year colleges (with) tuition paid, as long as they keep a minimum GPA. We need to provide Internet in every community in this state, as well as better cell service. This is again part of our infrastructure. We just drove to Lawrence County today, on the way back from Lawrence County, I tried to call somebody three times and the call dropped three times. And this is not way out in the woods, this is just off the interstate, so we've got to take steps to improve that. ... Kids notice that more than old folks. ... Folks your age and younger—my kids' age—everything they do is through this phone in their hand, and they know when they don't have cell service. So in terms of engagement of younger voters, I definitely can and will do a better job of that as we move forward in November.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Tuition is a big thing. Making Mississippi an attractive place to live by offering 21st-century jobs. I mean, we can do things that attract companies here, but we have to fix our own house first. I think we take the (state) flag, and we put the flag in a museum. Then we adopt a new state flag that everybody can be proud of, because if 40 percent of your population is offended by your state flag, then it's time for it to go. And I think a lot of young people see things like H.B. 1523. ... They see some of these carry-guns-in-churches kind of bills, the bills we see over there. They see the state flag and the reluctance to do anything about it. They see Confederate Memorial Day; they see these things as reasons why they shouldn't come to Mississippi. And hopefully, if they know that I'm the candidate who has opposed those things that are divisive in nature and give Mississippi a black eye, then they can get on board because I'm the kind of candidate who wants to change this 'us-versus-them' mentality that we've been suffering under for so long, and turn the page on this, and make Mississippi an open and inviting place for all ages.</p>

<p>Are you planning more town halls?</p>

<p>Between now and Tuesday the 26th, the answer is no. Going forward, yes. And I intend to ask Roger Wicker on June 27 if he will debate me, and what I intend to propose to him is at least four debates: one in each congressional district, live, televised debates. ... There will be two other folks on the ballot in November in this race. ... The people I think deserve to hear us talk side-by-side about the issues, and I'm not afraid of that.</p>

<p>I know I probably don't know (as much) about foreign policy at this moment as Roger Wicker, as he's been in Washington for 24 years. If he doesn't know more than me about foreign policy, that's his fault, but I will get up to speed. I think the people deserve to hear candidates debate, but no, I will not do another town hall between now and Tuesday the 26th. We just don't have the time and resources to do it right now. Our resources are better spent in other places.</p>

<p>Should you win the run-off, Wicker has a lot of campaign-finance resources. Do you have the funds?</p>

<p>Before I chose to get in this race, Wicker was sitting on four and a half million dollars, and I was sitting on zero. As I said earlier, I was pleasantly surprised by the outpouring of support I got from Mississippians. I was able to raise roughly $300,000 between March the 1st and June the 1st. In three months, I raised $100,000 a month. If I can raise that between now and November, I'd be in great shape. I don't know that we can do that, but we are certainly going to work as hard at it as we did in the primary. Here's the other thing: A lot of money was sidelined in this race because some folks don't want to give when there's a contested primary. They don't want to pick and choose between Democrats. Those folks will be off the sidelines after June 26. And I can tell you that we believe that we can attract the resources necessary to run a competitive campaign, including some folks who are outside the state who have already expressed interest in the possibility of electing two Democrats to represent Mississippi to Washington.</p>

<p>So I think some money will come. Am I saying I will match Roger Wicker dollar-for-dollar? No, but I don't need to because I have people on my side. Let me tell you a short vignette, this is a lived experience for me. When I ran against Scotty Cuevas in 2007, he was a 16-year incumbent, and he raised and spent probably twice as much as me, and I won. In 2011, I ran against a Republican who was endorsed by the governor and financially supported by the governor, she raised and spent three times as much as me, and I won by 16 points. Then in 2015, the governor, lieutenant governor and the Speaker of the House all endorsed and raised money for my opponent. He raised and spent four times as much as me, and I'm still sitting here.</p>

<p>So I don't mind long odds; it's what I do in my professional life every single day. That's what I've done in my political life. I know that's what I've gotten myself into, and I still believe in our possibility and our ability to win November 6. Look, we're outspent in this primary. Hell, he's loaned himself $650,000, and he's raised and spent with his loans probably close to a million, which is three times what I've raised and spent, and I have no idea what he's going to spend in the next week—but that difference will probably go up.</p>

<p>Howard Sherman won the most votes (about 31 percent) on June 5 in the Democratic primary for Sen. Roger Wicker's Senate seat. He even beat out longtime lawmaker Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis. Sherman, an entrepreneur and businessman, hired Alabama Sen. Doug Jones' campaign team and spent more than half a million dollars on his own campaign. Now Sherman faces Baria in a run-off election for the seat on June 26.</p>

<p>The California native moved to Meridian, Miss., permanently in 2016, with his wife and actress, Sela Ward, best known for her roles in TV shows like "CSI: New York" and "House" as well as films like "Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights." Ward, a Meridian native, and Sherman run Hope Village, a children's home in Meridian. Sherman and Ward have two kids but are now empty-nesters, and as Ward committed to filming "Westworld," Sherman met with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to figure out how he could get involved with politics in Mississippi. The Jackson Free Press sat down with Sherman in a back office of Lemuria in Jackson for a half hour interview on June 14.</p>

<p>Who or what convinced you to get into this race in the first place? ... What made you want to get into this Senate race to begin with?</p>

<p>Before I met my wife, Sela Ward, on a blind date 27 years ago, and just around that time, a little before that time, I was going to run for a congressional seat in Los Angeles where I lived. When I met Sela, I made a life choice. With her career being all over the place where she films and a career in Washington, (politics) wouldn't work, and it was very, very important for me to have a family and children and have some sense of balance, so I put that on hold—I thought (it) was (a) permanent hold, and then I spent a lifetime with Sela.</p>

<p>We've been married 26 plus years, and raising two fabulous kids and migrating from moving from Los Angeles to Mississippi. First, we spent four months a year (in Mississippi) because we wanted our children to understand authenticity, not superficiality. And now we've lived here two years full-time. I didn't plan two years ago when we moved here full-time to run for political office, and last December....</p>

<p>Let me segue for a second. Eighteen years ago, Sela and I came across these two young African American boys, Jimmy and Michael, in our (Meridian) community that were about to be separated. Their parents' rights had been terminated, and they didn't have any place to keep them together. There was no foster home for them, and we weren't in a position to take them because Sela was on a TV show 16 hours a day, and I was raising our kids while running my business, so we found a place for them. (We) swore to ourselves that that would be our project, giving to the community, and we started Hope Village for Children. We spent two years putting it together, and then 18 years ago we opened our doors, and since then, we're really proud of it.</p>

<p>We've taken care of over 3,000 kids—Mississippi's most challenged kids—and we're so proud of it. So I kiddingly say, you can mess with me, but don't mess with my kids—either my two kids or my Hope Village kids. And last December, I got a phone call from the executive director of Hope Village, and she said, "I need you in Jackson Thursday." And I was like, "What's up?" and she goes "I'll tell you in the car." So I jump in the car with her, and she explains to me that the Legislature in Jackson passed H.B. 2179, signed off by everybody, including the person I'm running against. He voted for it. And what the bill did was it moved the agency that funds kids, the kids at Hope Village and social workers, etcetera, and it moved that agency from being a DHS (Department of Human Services) agency to Child Protective Services.</p>

<p>By doing that, they lost all of their DHS funding, over $50 million. So suddenly, the crisis was that there was no money for more social workers. ... It was in a real crisis—and that's just horrible. I'm not going to stand here and accuse people who voted for that that they really wanted to do something horrible for the kids, but I will accuse them of just not understanding the implications of what they were doing. That in the private sector, a day doesn't go by that you're not thinking about revenue. If you have a business (like) Jackson Free Press, I'm sure they think about revenue all the time. And yet, a career legislator would think, "Oh let's move it, that sounds like a good idea. We'll move it to child protective services."</p>

<p>So I was so upset, because it would have been the end of Hope Village, so and then it triggers this waterfall effect. You know when you make a mistake, it's not just the immediate ramifications, there's the waterfall effect. (It) puts us in breach of the Olivia Y lawsuit, which is where Mississippi was sued for poor care of the kids, now the federal government could come in and take over—there's a cascade effect. So I went and met with the Democratic Party, and said, "What opportunities are there for me to get involved?" Because now that we're empty-nesters and our son is in the professional workforce and my daughter is going to be a junior in college... We talked about how there's only two races on the ballot: the congressional seat and the Senate seat, and we looked at my background, my message, my ability and what I could do with the state and the way that the district was gerrymandered, we decided the Senate would be better.</p>

<p>And I left there with the paper, took it home, filled it out. It's a very simple paper actually, it's like name, address, and are you a felon or something like that. So I filled it out, wrote the check, but didn't send it in because it's an enormous undertaking: not just the campaigning, but it is literally hijacking your life to go do something completely different. You know, Sela and I have worked hard for careers that are almost 40 years long and raised kids. We very much—I kiddingly say, but I'm not kidding, I probably haven't had a day off since third grade. I could probably justify taking a day off. I've created thousands of jobs and supported my wife in a career that's very demanding, so I thought about it, and I wasn't ready yet to do it.</p>

<p>And then February came, and the federal government (and) President Trump passed, with Roger Wicker's support, the "Family First Prevention Services Act" which took money from what was funding kids—the money that we had lost by virtue of Jackson that they've (since) scrambled to put (CPS) back under DHS—but they took that money and they put it in a good place, to help families keep kids before they lose them to foster care, but they didn't replace the money from someplace else. So in the long run, perhaps there will be less kids in the system, but not immediately, you're still getting kids everyday.</p>

<p>So (Congress) completely stripped our funding to very low levels, but worse, they layered conditions on children's homes in the state that not a single one in Mississippi that is a state-funded institution meet. So technically, as of today, Hope Village, Canopy, all the children's homes have to close, which leaves no place for these kids to go. (Editor's note: States do not have to submit new plans under the federal legislation until October, and the new plans will not go into effect until October 2019.) And it's not just where the kids go that don't have a home, we will get kids that they pull out of a home that need to just be stabilized. They've seen mom and dad go to jail, so we'll spend a month stabilizing them, letting them know... they are in a community of kids. There are tutors who work with them to get them on track.</p>

<p>Sen. Wicker supported President Trump with that bill, so all the executive directors flew to Washington—many of them from Hope Village and Canopy and several (others)—flew up to sit with him and say, "Sen. Wicker, this is bad policy, the conditions, because we otherwise have to close, and you've got to find the money somewhere." And the senator didn't show up for the meeting. They sat in his office and met with his staff, and then when he came, he said, "I'm sorry, y'all, I have another meeting," and they had to leave. So they never met with him. They met with some 20-something-year-old staffer. That's when I sent the paper in. It's just not OK; I mean this is just, when you have politicians that take big money from special interest groups, that's their real constituency.</p>

<p>That's what's wrong, and one of the first things I would love to do, and there's like 40 things at number one on my list, but one of them is campaign-finance reform. Because if there is a politician who is taking—if it requires big money to win and the people who give you the big money, then they become constituents of yours, and probably in line in front of Mr. and Mrs. Jones living in the suburbs. So when a bill comes up and Monsanto gave one of our senators money, does he vote for Monsanto or does he vote for the Delta so we don't have to use toxic things?</p>

<p>... We just need to bring, you know, creativity, and I'm a business guy. I published my 100-day plan on my website to just say, I'm not just going to tell you like my competitor in this race is, "I'm going to go fight for you, I'm going to go get us what we deserve." Well duh, anybody would do that.</p>

<p>It's thinking out of the box. This state is a remarkable, remarkable place. It's not a state with problems. It's just a very much under-performing state. I talk about it like a sports analogy—like the Cleveland Cavaliers before they got Tyrone Lew. Or the Warriors before Steve Curry became the coach. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson were there. When you put the right leaders, you can re-shuffle the parts, so when you look at my 100-day plan, it's not just, "Well, I'll go get as much money," because you know everybody is fighting for that money. There's a limited amount; there's no appropriations tree that we grow in the Delta that we can water... So anyway, that's the concept, so when the second red line was crossed with the "family prevention" act, (I filed to run).</p>

<p>Talk to me a bit about your business background. Your website mentions that you, your company contracted with the Department of Defense in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, and how that background would translate into your role as senator.</p>

<p>One of the things that my opponent loves to say about me is that I gave $500 to Jeff Sessions, so after 9/11, you're too young to remember this.</p>

<p>Oh, no. I'm not ...</p>

<p>But anthrax packages were showing up, laden with biochemical things, we were really afraid that the next shoe to drop after 9/11 would be a chemical attack, a biochemical attack. (Former President) George Bush announces this $6 billion Bioshield program, (saying), 'We will fund anything that can help us be safe from that.' So I was friends with a Nobel Prize winner, and he calls me up and says, "I was reading about this; I think I've got the answer. I think I can trick an immune response that we're all born with, the alpha gal-immune response, which causes us to reject foreign organs. We're all born with it, really robust. I can hijack it to go after whatever you want: anthrax, smallpox without inoculation." I said, 'Carey, that's huge,' and he said, "I need some money to do my research," so I called my lawyer and he said, "Here's a Washington lawyer who does these things." And he says, "You know what? Jeff Sessions knows Tony (Anthony) Fauci at NIH (National Institutes of Health). We've got to get to NIH, because if NIH recommends it, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) will fund it."</p>

<p>So he takes me. We fly to Washington. We go to a cocktail party—$500 and meet Senator Sessions. He's just the senator of Alabama. I don't know I'm running for the Senate 15 years later. I'm there trying to help a Nobel Prize winner get funded. He introduces us; we sit in a meeting with Tony Fauci. Tony Fauci takes us over to DARPA, and he gets funded. A Nobel Prize winner is working on something that can make us all safe. If I go back to that moment, do I not go to that cocktail party and get this guy funded to make us safe? Of course not. There's not a person on the planet that would argue with that, so that leads me to DARPA.</p>

<p>I'm at the closing dinner with DARPA, and I turn to one of the PhDs, and I said, "What is the coolest technology you've ever worked on that you could tell me about?" He told me about this technology that noninvasively can control your body's temperature through the palm of your hand. I say, "Is it top-secret?" He said, "No, I mean, we're using it, and we're experimenting with it." I call the CEO up; it's a Michigan company. He and I become friends; next thing you know, I become deeply involved with the company.</p>

<p>And then we introduce a product that's used to keep our soldiers—we were in Iraq and Afghanistan—these wonderful, amazing soldiers were driving around in Humvees where it's 120 degrees inside, they have 50 pounds of gear on, there's no air conditioning, it's not a Chrysler. And when you get overheated, your body's ability to operate breaks down—that's why at one point, you cramp up. So we introduced the product that's used to this day by soldiers in training, and they use them in the Middle East.</p>

<p>So we took that company and said, "Well, if you can cool a body, you can warm the body." So now we've introduced the product that's used in the operating room because the current product that's used in the operating room blows hot air on top of your body—literally just warms, you're in a warm cocoon. But there's over 6,000 lawsuits against that company because in that air could be a pathogen, and it's all over your body. So we took that same technology and used it actually in Meridian, to you put your hand in this thing, and it's recirculating warm water. There's no air, so that technology will lower infections in operating rooms.</p>

<p>So it was just chance, and when you're an entrepreneur like me, I get asked all the time what's the number-one trait of an entrepreneur, and it has to be great peripheral vision. I was trying to help my friend get funding to help us all (stay) safe. The next thing you know, I'm in the health care business ... then I meet the Michigan company, we develop a product for our soldiers, and now I'm in the perioperative warming business, and now I'm introducing that as a senator which doesn't require legislation, it just requires leadership.</p>

<p>You were registered as a Republican voter in California at one time. When did that (party affiliation) shift happen for you? Has it been a gradual shift, and now you're running as a Democrat. ... I'm curious if this has been over time or a light-switch thing.</p>

<p>I am the son of an immigrant. My mother and her mother came to this country from Eastern Europe, and when you grow up in a family like that, it's a solidly Democratic family. My first early memories of politics was going door-to-door for JFK in 1960. When he was elected, my parents thought he was the second coming. He was going to bring us, unite us all together—we were going to go to the moon with him. And I still have my little JFK pin locked away in a safe deposit box, and I was a Democrat because Democrats were empathetic.</p>

<p>Democrats were not, at that time, anti-business, they were not anti-success. But they were success (focused), but humanistic. So you know, my mother comes to this country not speaking a word of English, but it was all about education. So I spend my life in education. I wind up getting my master's degree, so in my 40s, now I'm a career entrepreneur. And in California, a very different place than Mississippi, a very different place, a place where they elected "The Terminator" Arnold (Schwarzenegger), twice to be the governor.</p>

<p>Now do you think the Democrats in Mississippi would support Arnold to be their governor? Probably not. So the Democrats got very "anti-business," that's a general term, but businesses were leaving the state because they were over-regulating and taxes were going up. And Elon Musk ... is building his cars in California, but he puts his battery plant out of state. Look at my wife's business, it was all in Los Angeles, it was all in Hollywood, and now it's in Atlanta, it's in New Orleans, it's in Canada—my wife's last TV show was filmed in Albuquerque. Because they got hostile, they got purist, and you know, a Republican in California is not a Republican in Mississippi.</p>

<p>On social issues they (California Republicans) are much more moderate, so my feeling is that if you don't have strong businesses, you don't have jobs. And if you don't have jobs, it creates a spiral effect, that now you, not just economically, but you have households where the daddy is not working or the mama is not working, it creates a whole self-esteem thing and the kids see dad ... So that was when around 2000, I switched (political parties) in my mid-40s from being a Democrat to Republican because I just didn't like what was happening with California Democrats. On a national level, I continued to vote Democratic, but just locally—in the state—I voted (Republican).</p>

<p>And then when we moved to Mississippi, and here I just very much disagree with the Republicans. Republicans have a supermajority in Jackson, so they literally have the ball and the referees, and the Democrats are on the sidelines—and they still can't get us off the bottom. And they are busy arguing about the 15 percent of stuff without saying, "I will argue with me about the flag or about whatever, but let's get (to) fixing health care." So it was just really me leaving California.</p>

<p>Ironically, in the beginning, when my campaign team—when I hired the Doug Jones' campaign team—they said, "You realize they're going to paint you as a California liberal, too liberal for Mississippi." It's so ironic. So everyone knows California and Massachusetts are very liberal, so it was really driven by what they were doing to the business community. So it wasn't a tipping-point moment, it was just when I saw people, friends in my wife's business, losing houses and having to move out, that's when I changed parties, and now that I'm in Mississippi, there's not a doubt (about running as a Democrat).</p>

<p>What is your position on the GOP tax bill that they just passed? Are there changes you want to see in it, or does it need to go away completely?</p>

<p>Here's my problem with the tax bill. I was an econ major in college. Tax policy is a part of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is what the federal government uses to guide the economy to make corrections. I read today, everybody is excited about the low unemployment numbers, which is great, but now there's inflationary pressure starting. There's a whole balance, and they tweak it, just you know, so now we might have got, I'm not saying we've got overgrowth, but now interest rates have been up for the second time, and it will go up two more times this year.</p>

<p>So that's what fiscal policy is a part of, so my problem ... fiscal policy is designed to achieve an objective. I don't know what the objective was (of the tax bill). The objective was to corporations, "We're going to give you a boat-load of cash." So if they had said, "What do we need? Where do we want them to direct that money?" Because a lot of them just bought their stock back. A lot of them bonused out CEOs, and they bought yachts from Italy—well, that didn't help the economy at all. Had they said—see , I'm not privy to the information to justify or not justify the tax cut, but had they said, "Oh my gosh, in these parts of your state, pick a plighted part of the state, if you put a plant there in the Delta where unemployment is high, we will give you a tax cut." But if you just are simply going to rebuy your stock back, it didn't do anything for the economy. I'm not saying I'm anti the tax cut; I'm anti an unfocused tax cut.</p>

<p>Talk to me about your policy priorities on immigration. Do you think that something should happen in terms of a DACA-border wall compromise like they were talking about? And then most recently with the new asylum decree from Jeff Sessions saying that domestic violence and gang affiliation (fleeing or turning in gang members) don't count for asylum anymore.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we were all immigrants at some point going back far enough in our family tree. Directly, my mother was an immigrant, so I think it's a big part of what makes this country, not just this heritage, but literally on a current, it brings in fresh ideas, fresh blood, etcetera. However, there's nothing wrong with being focused on it again. .... Some of immigration definitely needs to be focused on. If we have a shortage of nurses, then let's say, "Hey, guess what? We'll bring in 10,000 nurses." But if we have an over-abundance of construction workers, and there are already people having a hard time finding (a job), then maybe we don't bring in a ton of construction workers. I want to bring in—I don't know what the right number is—if it's 100,000 or whatever, but maybe we can do it in a way where we don't create a problem by trying to solve a problem.</p>

<p>The DACA thing is really tricky because these people have been here for a long time; they are integrated. I do believe that people who come from elsewhere really got to play by the rules. We're not opening a door to have people come in here and wind up in jail, that's not the point of the thing. So but you know, people who are a part of the DACA generation that are law-abiding, I think we give them a path. And the border wall, you know, we're in such a deficit to begin with. I haven't seen the data that shows me that that's going to really keep us safe. We do need to be kept safe; all it takes is one person getting through, and we're in jeopardy.</p>

<p>What is your stance on abortion rights?</p>

<p>OK, abortion rights, obviously ... falls into that 15 percent that you know, obviously, that divides us. You know there are certain issues in life that are individual, moral compass issues that I think you know... I'm a religious person; I'm a spiritual person that I think you're accountable to yourself and to whatever you think the Lord is ... as your senator ... the only place you're going to impact that is voting on a Supreme Court justice, and I'd never be a single-issue person. I would never rule somebody out because of that, and I would never vote for somebody exclusively for that. So at the moment, it's not really a major part of this campaign, so that's all I have to say about that.</p>

<p>What national reforms, if any, do you support for criminal justice?</p>

<p>We need to definitely migrate from looking at prisons as warehouses to looking at prisons for rehabilitation, if we can. I'm actually involved in a company that is moving their production to a federal prison in Beaumont, Texas, because they are opening a factory within the prison. So anything we can do, especially with nonviolent offenders, if we can do things like that: employ them, give them a job so when they come out, they're not just... they've been in the library and then they have to go find a job.</p>

<p>So rehabilitation has got to be a huge thing, and we also have to look at alternative ways for nonviolent offenders (to re-enter society). It might be a game of chance to just, you know, with an electronic bracelet, and say, "You got a job; you got a home. We know where the club is. We know where your buddies who take you to no good is. We are going to give you this chance." People make mistakes. There's a mayor in Mississippi who's a good friend of mine, owns multiple businesses, is a preacher and oh by the way, did time for six years. So people can be rehabilitated.</p>

<p>Why should voters try you, a non-native Mississippian, versus your opponent who has lived here his whole life?</p>

<p>That is the most baffling thing that my opponent is running on, because if you have a choice between a person who's proven to know how to create jobs and offer creative solutions. ... You know, he and I were at the county supervisors' meeting down on the coast ... and he spoke and I spoke. And (my talk) was filled with, "Here's how we get infrastructure dollars beyond federal dollars. Here's how we can cut costs." We can group municipalities together to go for joint bids. There's a lot of things. We can look for corporate sponsors for bridges. You want good will in the community? We'll put a billboard up that says this bridge repaired by Goodyear or something. He got up there and said, "I'm the only one in this race who was born here." I don't know how him being born here, versus me not being born here, fixes that bridge or gets us health care. The voters voted a week and a half ago, and they said, "We're going to pick the guy who wasn't born here because his ideas are better, his view of the future is better." And if they vote for him because he was born here, then you're not going to wind up with these ideas. I don't know what to tell you.</p>

<p>When Blake Feldman was in college, he planned on going to medical school. The Newton, Miss., native received a bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Southern Mississippi in 2011. However, after graduation he decided against the medical field and ended up going to University of Georgia School of Law instead.</p>

<p>At first, he thought he would focus on public-health law, but in a class during the first year, he began to see injustices in the country's criminal-justice system, particularly aspects of it in the Deep South.</p>

<p>He says he got lucky during his first semester when he got one of the best criminal-law professors at Georgia Law, Erica Hashimoto. In that class, she covered topics such as racial bias in sentencing and prosecutorial discretion (authority of an agency or officer to decide charges in a case and how to pursue it).</p>

<p>"Georgia Law isn't a super progressive law school," he says. "I was really shocked at really, really brilliant peers in my class who were unmoved by some things that I thought were just egregious."</p>

<p>That motivated him to change his elective to criminal procedure.</p>

<p>"Criminal procedure is really where you see the systemic breakdown of fair courts, especially for people of color and for low-income individuals," he says. "You just start out thinking like, 'Oh, the Fourth Amendment, this is such a great thing, and that it's just over the course of three months, you just see it chipped and chipped and chipped away."</p>

<p>He received his law degree in 2015 and decided to focus on advocacy and community organizing, and policy council and analysis. In July 2015, he wrapped up his assignments with the public defender's office in Athens, Ga., and that August, he became the advocacy coordinator for criminal justice reform at the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi. In that position, he often spent time at the Mississippi Capitol during the legislative sessions, and when he was not there, he worked with ACLU on policy advocacy at county and state levels, and assisted with developing litigation for class-action lawsuits.</p>

<p>He left the organization earlier this year and worked with Southern Poverty Law Center on a case and is doing policy advocacy consulting for a criminal-justice-reform organization Justice Collaborative LLC in Louisiana. For the next year, he says he wants to keep doing part-time advocacy and consulting.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department's watchdog faults former FBI Director James Comey for breaking with established protocol in his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, but it says his decisions before the 2016 elections were not driven by political bias, according to a person familiar with the findings.</p>

<p>The report from the inspector general also criticizes Comey for not keeping his superiors at the Justice Department, including former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, properly informed about his handling of the investigation, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the report is not yet public.</p>

<p>The report's findings are to be made public later Thursday. It represents the culmination of an 18-month review into one of the most consequential FBI investigations in recent history.</p>

<p>The report has long been expected to criticize the FBI's handling of the Clinton email probe, stepping into a political minefield while examining how a nonpartisan law enforcement agency came to be entangled in the 2016 presidential race.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump is looking to the report to provide a fresh line of attack against two former top FBI officials, Comey and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, as he claims that a politically tainted bureau tried to undermine his campaign and, through the later Russia investigation, his presidency. Trump is certain to try to use the report to validate his firing of Comey last year.</p>

<p>But the report could do more to back Democratic claims that the FBI actually contributed to Trump's victory, most notably by reopening in the final days of the race its investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information. That development unfolded as Trump's own campaign — unbeknownst at the time to the American public — also came under FBI investigation for possible coordination with Russia.</p>

<p>Inspector General Michael Horowitz, a former federal prosecutor appointed by President Barack Obama, prepared the report. Supporters from both parties regard him as apolitical. His most significant report before this was the 2012 study of the botched Obama-era gun operation known as Fast and Furious.</p>

<p>The Clinton report will examine key actions by FBI leaders, including Comey's decision to publicly announce in July 2016 his recommendation against criminal charges for Clinton, and his disclosure to Congress days before the election that the investigation was being revived because of newly discovered emails.</p>

<p>An earlier inspector general report criticized McCabe and led to his firing on allegations that he misled internal investigators about his role in a news media disclosure. He denies those charges.</p>

<p>Thursday's IG findings were first reported by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>JACKSON — A group of Jackson and Hinds County leaders has begun meeting bi-monthly to work on improvements to the adult and juvenile justice systems in the city and county, after Hinds County entered into a 2016 settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>

<p>DOJ investigated the Raymond and Jackson detention centers in 2014, and the county's juvenile justice center, Henley-Young, was the subject of a federal lawsuit back in 2011. DOJ issued a findings letter in 2015 with concerns about inmate safety at the Raymond and Jackson facilities, alleging that the county was in violation of detainees' constitutional rights.</p>

<p>Hinds County Board of Supervisors attorney Pieter Teeuwissen said all the stakeholders involved in the criminal justice system need to figure out how to move people through the system faster. Right now, individuals can sit in jail for as long as four years, he said.</p>

<p>"We need to figure out how to prioritize these individuals in these facilities," Teeuwissen told the Jackson Free Press. "... If they are not guilty, we shouldn't have them detained in less than appropriate conditions. If they are guilty, they are supposed to be processed through and put in the state correction system."</p>

<p>As a part of the settlement agreement, county and city stakeholders had to form the Hinds County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, which is working to ensure that people do not get stuck in the jails for too long and that cases move through the system quickly. The council meetings do not have to be public, Teeuwissen said, but he believes they will be in the near future.</p>

<p>The settlement agreement requires the county to recognize that "it must provide prisoners with adequate supervision and housing in order to prevent violence between prisoners and the use of excessive force by detention staff," the settlement agreement says.</p>

<p>"The county also acknowledges that government detention is a serious infringement on the rights of citizens and other individuals, and is thus subject to constitutional rights."</p>

<p>County leaders must work to decrease the incarcerated population "particularly special-needs populations, such as individuals with serious mental illness and juveniles," the settlement agreement says.</p>

<p>Teeuwissen said he thinks the council's work will be long-term.</p>

<p>"I think that what you're seeing now is a work in progress," he said.</p>

<p>The Hinds County Board of Supervisors voted to formally recognize the Hinds County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council on May 21.</p>

<p>The council is divided into five groups that will work on improvements to address behavioral health, case processing, jail population management, prisoner reentry and juvenile justice, a press release from the Administrative Office of the Courts says.</p>

<p>Senior Circuit Judge Tomie Green and Hinds County Administrator Carmen Davis co-chair the 19-member council.</p>

<p>The other council members include:</p>

<p>• Hinds County Circuit Court Senior Judge</p>

<p>• Hinds County Chancery Court Senior Judge</p>

<p>• Hinds County Court Senior Criminal Judge</p>

<p>• Hinds County Youth Court Judge</p>

<p>• Hinds County Justice Court Senior Judge</p>

<p>• Jackson Municipal Court Senior Judge</p>

<p>• Hinds County District Attorney</p>

<p>At a June 11 press conference, the City of Jackson announced that Michelle L. Thomas is stepping in to help the City through the budget process and assist Robert Blaine, the CAO and now interim director of the Department of Administration and Finance. Photo by Michelle L. Thomas</p>

<p>JACKSON — The woman who helped lead a budget turnaround in Newark, N.J., under then-Mayor Cory Booker will manage the City of Jackson's budget overhaul. Michelle L. Thomas, a financial expert with nearly 10 years of experience in both the public and private sector, will assist with day-to-day operations alongside Chief Administrative Robert Blaine, leading the City through the budget process.</p>

<p>Blaine is officially absorbing the duties of his recently departed colleague, Charles Hatcher, who resigned the finance post suddenly at the end of May.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba announced at a press conference last week that an interim director with a wealth of experience would be forthcoming. But Chief of Staff Safiya Omari told reporters on Monday that the City simply did not have the funds to hire Thomas for the position.</p>

<p>"We would love to have had Michelle as our interim director, but we can't afford her," Omari said.</p>

<p>Omari expressed excitement for bringing Thomas in, even on a temporary basis. "We're confident that she has the skills and the knowledge to move us through our budgeting period and also to address some of the other issues we're facing in the department of finance right now," she said.</p>

<p>Thomas began as Newark's director of innovation and performance management in 2006, and two years later, stepped into the role as interim business administrator.</p>

<p>Some city officials questioned Thomas' preparedness at first, as she had majored in African American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But after her success in the position, the Star-Ledger characterized Thomas as "the woman who steered the Newark budget through one of the worst economic crises in the city's history" in an article published after the city council unanimously confirmed her as business administrator.</p>

<p>Thomas cut Newark's deficit by $105 million, and she raked in $126 million in federal money for the City of Newark. She also focused on tax and fee collection.</p>

<p>In 2011, Thomas served as deputy mayor for operations in New Orleans under Mayor Mitchell Landrieu until she stepped down for personal reasons. Thomas made $164,000 in that role.</p>

<p>She then served as chief administrative officer and later interim executive director of the Louisiana Housing Corporation.</p>

<p>In the private sector as president of Thomas Consulting Group, she managed special projects for the Orleans Parish School Board, developed a five-year strategic financial plan for Hinds County and also for the Finance Authority of New Orleans, her LinkedIn page says.</p>

<p>Lumumba was out on vacation during this announcement, but the City provided a statement from him. "Ms. Thomas brings a wealth of knowledge and financial experience working with municipalities across the nation," the statement reads. "We are confident that she will continue to move our city forward in the interim."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus on Thursday endorsed a candidate in the Democratic primary runoff for a Republican-held U.S. Senate seat, but a caucus member who lost in the primary questioned the decision.</p>

<p>The caucus chairwoman, Rep. Sonya Williams-Barnes of Gulfport, said the 49-member group is supporting state Rep. David Baria of Bay St. Louis.</p>

<p>Rep. Omeria Scott of Laurel, who is a caucus member, placed third in the six-person Democratic Senate primary on June 5. She endorsed Baria's runoff opponent, venture capitalist Howard Sherman of Meridian, three days later.</p>

<p>Asked about the caucus endorsement of Baria, Scott told The Associated Press on Thursday: "Nobody's asked me."</p>

<p>Scott questioned whether the decision about the Baria endorsement was made according to caucus rules. Williams-Barnes did not immediately respond to an AP question about that.</p>

<p>Sherman finished slightly ahead of Baria in the first round of voting.</p>

<p>In the Nov. 6 general election, the Democratic nominee will face Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, the Reform Party's Shawn O'Hara of Hattiesburg, and Libertarian Danny Bedwell of Columbus.</p>

<p>Wicker has held the Senate seat since late 2007. Mississippi last had a Democrat in the U.S. Senate in January 1989.</p>

<p>All caucus members are Democrats, and African-Americans are a crucial part of the voting base that will choose a party nominee in the June 26 runoff.</p>

<p>Baria, an attorney, served one term in the state Senate before winning two terms in the House.</p>

<p>Williams-Barnes said in a statement that Baria has a legislative record of voting for education and mental health funding, and he has advocated expanding Medicaid, making changes to the criminal justice system and removing the Confederate battle emblem from the state flag.</p>

<p>"He is not shy when it comes to voting on issues ... which we favor or not favor," Williams-Barnes said. "He is with us, and for that, we the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, are proud to call him a partner in moving Mississippi forward."</p>

<h2 id="jacksonevenlesstransparentwithofficerinvolvedshootings">Jackson Even Less Transparent with Officer-Involved Shootings?</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-13</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/13/jackson-even-less-transparent-officer-involved-sho/ </p>

<p>Since the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations took over officer-involved shooting cases in Jackson in May 2018, there has been seemingly less information given out to the public because the state agency does not have to provide updates to those outside of law enforcement. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Just one month after Mississippi Bureau of Investigations officially began handling officer-involved shootings in Jackson, it has been harder to get information previously available to citizens and reporters following these incidents.</p>

<p>Mississippi Department of Public Safety Communications Chief Warren Strain, who now handles all communications concerning officer-involved shootings in Jackson, told the Jackson Free Press that it is MBI's policy not to discuss open or closed investigations with anyone who is not law enforcement or a district attorney.</p>

<p>On May 8, the Jackson City Council approved a memorandum of understanding between the City and the state agency. Just a half-day later, the Jackson Police Department reported the City's eighth officer-involved shooting since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba took office in July 2017. During a traffic stop around 1 a.m. on May 9, a JPD officer pulled over Elliot Reed and Chauncy Reed, apparently brothers, at the Valero gas station on Cooper Road.</p>

<p>Public Information Officer Sgt. Roderick Holmes said in a statement that the officer and the suspects exchanged fire. The officer did not suffer any serious injuries, but Elliot died at a local hospital following the incident. Chauncy, who survived, was charged with aggravated assault on a police officer and capital murder. Elliot is the third person to die at the hands of JPD in 2018.</p>

<p>Holmes' statement following this shooting was the last time reporters got information via email about developments in an officer-involved shooting, and this could be the reality going forward. Another one took place on June 1, but save for a tweet from JPD starved for critical information, there has been little other information about the shooting.</p>

<h1 id="jpdisatthesceneofanofficerinvolvedshootingthatoccurredin100blockofcalhounstmbiiscurrentlyatthesceneconductingtheinvestigationnoadditionalinfoavailable">JPD is at the scene of an officer-involved shooting that occurred in 100 block of Calhoun St. MBI is currently at the scene conducting the investigation. No additional info available.</h1>

<p>— Jackson Police Dept. (@JacksonMSPolice) June 1, 2018</p>

<p>"#JPD is at the scene of an officer-involved shooting that occurred in 100 block of Calhoun St.," the tweet reads. "MBI is currently at the scene conducting the investigation. No additional info available."</p>

<p>Holmes is aware of the concern that people will get less information following officer-involved shootings, but he cannot do much about it.</p>

<p>"That's out of our hands, because once (MBI) takes the investigation over, which as soon as it's an officer-involved shooting ... there is very limited information if an that we're able to release at that point because it is their active investigation," Holmes said.</p>

<p>Considering JPD likely never released the names of officers involved or the status of the investigation. The added lack of details from MBI compounds the information blockage.</p>

<p>The two aforementioned shootings are the only two officer-involved shootings MBI has investigated, despite Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba informing the family of Lee Edward Bonner at a city council meeting in March that MBI would be stepping in to handle that case.</p>

<p>'A Fact-finding Entity'</p>

<p>In the last couple of weeks, the mayoral-appointed officer-identification task force sent notice to MBI about the members' desire to bring in a speaker from the agency to discuss its investigative process, but has not yet received a response. Attorney CJ Lawrence, the chairman of the task force, said at the last meeting on June 4 that it gives the members reason to question transparency from MBI.</p>

<p>Strain told the JFP that the legal department is working on some kind of statement in response to the task force, but added that "typically MBI is not a policymaking entity; it is a fact-finding entity."</p>

<p>After three months of bi-weekly meetings, the task force has yet to delve into the City's use-of-force policy. However, the members said they will give the mayor their recommendations by the end of August.</p>

<p>A Bit of Sunshine</p>

<p>Despite less forthright information from City or MBI officials, some sunshine is peeking through to illuminate how the system works.</p>

<p>At a June 4 city press briefing, the mayor offered a glimpse into the officer-involved shooting on Calhoun Street. "We do know that one of the individuals involved in that admitted to firing at the officer," the mayor said.</p>

<p>Local media reported that the man injured in the shooting was taken to an area hospital with non-life threatening injuries and that the officer was not injured. No further information was made available by press time.</p>

<p>An April Hinds County grand-jury affidavit of no-bills surfaced last week, and it shows a failure to indict JPD officers who have killed citizens in at least three incidents since November 2017.</p>

<p>Officer Rakasha Adams was apparently involved in two of those deadly officer-involved shootings: one in November claiming the life of an unidentified man who allegedly brandished a knife at her, and the other in January, claiming the life of 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes.</p>

<p>The Barnes family hired a high-profile Baltimore-based attorney, Jason Downs, who served as legal counsel to the Freddie Gray family. At a press conference outside City Hall in May, Downs said he believed Officer Albert Taylor was the second person involved with the Barnes shooting, and he is listed on the "no bill" list under the same case as Officer Adams.</p>

<p>Downs, along with Mississippi attorney Carlos Moore, filed a petition on May 21 against the City of Jackson to retrieve the names of the two Jackson Police Department officers who were involved in the Barnes shooting following a traffic stop.</p>

<p>At press time, it is not clear if this no-bill list from April 2018 has any effect on Downs and Moore's demand for JPD to release the names of officers who shot and killed Barnes.</p>

<h2 id="howabrexitboysprojectendedupinjacksoncourt">How A ‘Brexit Boys’ Project Ended Up in Jackson Court</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-13</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/13/how-brexit-boys-project-ended-jackson-court/ </p>

<p>Kyle Taylor, director of Fair Vote U.K., filed a lawsuit against companies started by “Brexit Boys,” hoping to bring a data project to Mississippi. Photo by Kyle Taylor</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. — On a blistering Mississippi Tuesday, a camera crew followed Kyle Taylor, dressed in a tailored blue suit, from his attorney's downtown Jackson office to the Hinds County Chancery Courthouse. Taylor had flown to Mississippi to challenge the latest data project of two British companies, with ties to the U.K.'s "Brexit" campaign to leave the European Union.</p>

<p>The project was slated to be located at the University of Mississippi's Insight Park with the help of state dollars.</p>

<p>Taylor believes Eldon Insurance and Big Data Dolphins Ltd. might be using U.K. citizens' data in their new artificial-intelligence project they have planned to start in Oxford, Miss. Attorneys and principals at those companies deny transferring any data from the U.K. to Mississippi as a part of the project, however.</p>

<p>Arron Banks, a "Brexit" leader who co-founded the Leave.EU campaign with Andy Wigmore, owns Eldon Insurance, which started the Big Data Dolphins project.</p>

<p>In the third-floor courtroom, a local Baker Donelson attorney, Sterling Kidd, represented the two British companies. He sat with a British attorney, John Banks (who the Associated Press reported is kin to Arron Banks), and Victoria Sena, an Eldon employee tasked with managing the Mississippi project. Chancery Court Judge Denise Owens had a child-support case ahead of Taylor's, so both parties waited on opposite sides of the courtroom. Taylor sat with his attorney Dorsey Carson, who also does legal work for the Jackson Free Press, as well as Emma Briant, a British lecturer whose interviews with "Brexit" leaders became a part of Parliament's inquiry into "fake news." She would later testify in the hearing.</p>

<p>When it was Taylor's turn, videographers filming for a documentary project started their cameras.</p>

<p>Kidd made his clients' position clear early. Eldon and Big Data Dolphins believe that the Mississippi lawsuit is improper because it deals with U.K. companies and a U.K. citizen. Taylor is a dual-citizen of Canada and the U.S. who has been living in the U.K.</p>

<p>"No personal data of any British citizens has been transferred to Mississippi," Kidd told Judge Owens, emphasizing that besides the signed lease for Insight Park space, Big Data Dolphins has no operations at Ole Miss.</p>

<p>Investigations Across Waters</p>

<p>The Information Commissioner's Office, a public British agency that reports to Parliament, is investigating not only Eldon Insurance Ltd. but also Big Data Dolphins Ltd. The investigation is about how these companies might have used strategies including scraping and misusing U.K. citizen data. A letter saying so was not entered into evidence, but Carson gave the document to the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"The (ICO) investigation concerns the use of data and analytics methodology including the obtaining of personal information of U.K. citizens ... for the purpose of deploying targeted political advertisements in relation to the 2016 'Brexit' referendum, the alleged 'scraping' and misuse of data from millions of Facebook accounts in certain political campaign efforts, and whether any such conduct may have violated the British Data Protection Act of 1998, among other laws," the letter says.</p>

<p>The investigation springs from an inquiry into Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis group, that influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election, using scraped Facebook user data. Last week, Alexander Nix, former head of the group, admitted that the group did receive the Facebook data. Nix denied Cambridge Analytica's role in the "Brexit" election, however, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>Nigel Farage (here in Mississippi stumping for Donald Trump in 2016) spoke with Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore about the Mississippi case on his talk show this week.</p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica harvested more than 87 million American Facebook user profiles and their data during the 2016 presidential election. To scrape a user's data, it used third-party applications on the social-media network. How CA got access to so many users was tricky.</p>

<p>In 2015, some Facebook users clicked on a third-party application titled "This is Your Digital Life." When you use a third-party application, a pop-up box appears, asking you to give permission or access to some of your personal data. Users have two options—accept and allow the application to use all the data it lists, or decline and return back to Facebook without taking the quiz. Lots of Facebook users had their public profile, page likes, birthday and current city accessed if they clicked on the link. The catch was that even if you did not click on the link, if one of your Facebook friends did, your data was compromised, too.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary "Fake News Inquiry" is looking into whether or not U.K. citizens' data was similarly scraped and used to influence the "Brexit" election. In April, Brittany Kaiser, a former CA employee, testified before a parliamentary committee about her work at the data firm. She testified that Cambridge Analytica engaged with Banks and Wigmore to design parallel proposals for Leave.EU as well as Eldon Insurance. She took the lead on negotiations between CA and Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance, she said.</p>

<p>"Over a period of five months, we undertook both meetings and work at the Bristol headquarters of Eldon Insurance. ... Our work for UKIP/Leave.EU was never reported to the Electoral Commission by the party, the campaign or our company," she told the committee.</p>

<p>Banks denies Kaiser's testimony, and in front of a Parliamentary committee this week called her a "fantasist." Banks also said the committee had been "used by the Fair Vote campaign to push for a second referendum," the Guardian reported on June 12.</p>

<p>From 'Fake News' to Data Scraping?</p>

<p>Documents revealed in court, including emails between Eldon employees, show substantial plans for an artificial-intelligence data project at Ole Miss, including plans to "scrape social media data."</p>

<p>A parliamentary committee is currently investigating how "fake news" can influence elections, and Banks and Wigmore were scheduled for an oral evidence session in the U.K. on June 12. On June 8, Banks wrote a letter (tweeted out by Leave.EU) to the committee declining to testify and claiming that the committee is colluding with the Fair Vote project. "It is perfectly clear that the committee, which comprises only of Remain supporting MPs is conducting a co-ordinated 'Witch Hunt' of Leave groups, involving the Electoral Commission &amp; the ICO. You have called no witnesses from the Remain campaign or associated groups," Banks writes.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the letter, he listed "Facts" including that he met the Mississippi delegation at the Republican National Convention after the referendum, and they invited him to the state to meet Bryant.</p>

<p>"The project is still at the planning stage and has not commenced. No data was transferred to Mississippi from the UK," Banks writes. Banks and Wigmore changed their minds about not testifying to Parliament over the weekend after The Guardian published a story detailing documents that suggest that Banks met with Russian officials before the referendum. The two Leave.EU leaders have visited Mississippi before.</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant invited Banks and Wigmore, Nigel Farage and Lord Ashcroft to an Ole Miss football game last fall, a photo on Banks' Twitter account shows. Bryant said in an April statement that he initially suggested that the Big Data Dolphins project come to Mississippi. Plans for the project started as early as last fall.</p>

<p>Eldon officials and the University of Mississippi Research Foundation signed the lease for a new office to be built specifically for the project in February 2018. The lease said the foundation would pay for $100,000 of the construction, and the rest would be paid with a $100,000 grant from the Mississippi Development Authority.</p>

<p>MDA told the Jackson Free Press last week that it has not awarded that grant.</p>

<p>Victoria Sena testified in a quiet British accent before Judge Owens last week. She had written in her affidavit that Eldon representatives visited Oxford, Miss., twice in October 2017 to begin lease negotiations. Beyond that, she testified that nothing else has happened with data of any U.K. citizens.</p>

<p>"Neither Big Data nor Eldon have had or now have any equipment in Mississippi that would allow them to store the private data of British citizens there. Neither Big Data nor Eldon has, at any point in time, sent any personal data relating to citizens of the United Kingdom to the University of Mississippi, or to anyone else in Mississippi," she wrote in her affidavit.</p>

<p>Emails between Eldon employees show that the project would have included data scientists, marketing execs and a psychologist "working on projects to disrupt the market... Retailing through peer to peer groups and social media are areas where Arron sees opportunity," an email from Eldon employee Dave Taylor to Sena says.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Project</p>

<p>Big Data Dolphins staff were planning to work with Ken Cyree, the dean of the Ole Miss business school, and William Nicholas at Insight Park, the Big Data Dolphins' white paper, also released in court documents, shows.</p>

<p>"Within the first year of establishing a presence expectations are that the concept of establishing a presence at the Insight Park will be proven by the delivery of four to five AI projects across at least two of the above business areas," the white paper says.</p>

<p>Emails between Eldon employees show that Banks wanted to establish a "marketing focused AI office." The list of specific projects was sealed in the court record, but the rest of the emails are public record in court evidence. In an email from Dave Taylor, an Eldon employee, writes about the projects briefly.</p>

<p>"Arron would also like the team to acquire more sources of data and has mentioned that our plans to use software we have purchased (Kapow) to scrape social media data (Facebook profiles of our customers for starters) would fit in well with what is expected from Mississippi," the email says.</p>

<p>"We are already building up a sizeable data set but need to supplement with data from social media and analyse (hence the psychologist) to build up psychometric profiles we can adapt or build marketing campaigns to/for," Dave Taylor wrote in an Oct. 15, 2017, email to Sena.</p>

<p>The emails do not seem to prove that Big Data Dolphins or Eldon have transferred data to Ole Miss, but they do outline the plans for the project, which included building up data sets.</p>

<p>The companies were planning to recruit for the data-scientist positions through Mississippi Works, a website that lists jobs available in Mississippi. However, as Josh Gladden, the interim vice chancellor for research Ole Miss, testified in court last week, construction has not begun on the Big Data Dolphins office, despite the lease being signed in February.</p>

<p>MDA has not awarded its grant, either, implying that the project is currently stalled. Judge Owens asked attorneys to submit briefs by June 12. She will have to decide whether to extend the temporary injunction on the two companies or lift it.</p>

<p>Last month, with Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba's support, the Jackson City Council voted on a memorandum of understanding to have the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations handle officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths in Jackson. This threw an axe in the potential for any future progress concerning transparency from Jackson Police Department so long as the state agency is involved.</p>

<p>We now get even less information about the shootings. MBI does not have to disclose information concerning any open or closed investigations except to law enforcement. Considering the only information reporters and citizens got about the last officer-involved shooting was from a tweet on June 1, that policy is well-oiled and working as intended.</p>

<p>This decision also guts the mayoral-appointed officer-identification task force that has spent months meeting every two weeks to decide the best way to release details. The members' work and upcoming August policy recommendation could be futile now that MBI is handling these cases.</p>

<p>"We don't feel that it is a good practice to investigate yourself in these circumstances," Mayor Lumumba said on May 9.</p>

<p>The mayor is right, in part. Outside, unbiased investigations are better than internal investigations. However, bringing in the State will make transparency impossible because they do not have the same duties to report to journalists and citizens as JPD does. It will not matter what Jackson's policies are on releasing names following officer-involved shootings because of MBI's code of silence.</p>

<p>For a mayor who avoided a State takeover of his school district and who speaks openly about not wanting the State involved with the airport, it's surprising he was so willing to usher in MBI when it comes to officer-involved shootings. This is a subject matter he often claims to care about more than anyone else because he handled these cases as a lawyer before jumping into politics.</p>

<p>If the mayor would have just decided to lead the City through a policy change to releasing names, as he wanted to do before buying time with a task force, Jackson would not be in this information void. The likely result will be negative national publicity and more lawsuits forcing the names of officers into the public—as happened with a woman police officer involved in two shootings in a handful of months—because the City and the State seem determined to keep Jacksonians in the dark about officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>When Blake Feldman was in college, he planned on going to medical school. The Newton, Miss., native received a bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Southern Mississippi in 2011. However, after graduation he decided against the medical field and ended up going to University of Georgia School of Law instead.</p>

<p>At first, he thought he would focus on public-health law, but in a class during the first year, he began to see injustices in the country's criminal-justice system, particularly aspects of it in the Deep South.</p>

<p>He says he got lucky during his first semester when he got one of the best criminal-law professors at Georgia Law, Erica Hashimoto. In that class, she covered topics such as racial bias in sentencing and prosecutorial discretion (authority of an agency or officer to decide charges in a case and how to pursue it).</p>

<p>"Georgia Law isn't a super progressive law school," he says. "I was really shocked at really, really brilliant peers in my class who were unmoved by some things that I thought were just egregious."</p>

<p>That motivated him to change his elective to criminal procedure.</p>

<p>"Criminal procedure is really where you see the systemic breakdown of fair courts, especially for people of color and for low-income individuals," he says. "You just start out thinking like, 'Oh, the Fourth Amendment, this is such a great thing, and that it's just over the course of three months, you just see it chipped and chipped and chipped away."</p>

<p>He received his law degree in 2015 and decided to focus on advocacy and community organizing, and policy council and analysis. In July 2015, he wrapped up his assignments with the public defender's office in Athens, Ga., and that August, he became the advocacy coordinator for criminal justice reform at the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi. In that position, he often spent time at the Mississippi Capitol during the legislative sessions, and when he was not there, he worked with ACLU on policy advocacy at county and state levels, and assisted with developing litigation for class-action lawsuits.</p>

<p>He left the organization earlier this year and worked with Southern Poverty Law Center on a case and is doing policy advocacy consulting for a criminal-justice-reform organization Justice Collaborative LLC in Louisiana. For the next year, he says he wants to keep doing part-time advocacy and consulting.</p>

<p>Each year around Father's Day, we honor men in the Jackson metro area who are making differences in our communities. This year's include leaders, policy advocates, south Jackson warriors, creators of welcoming spaces, social-media experts, and more. Meet the 2018 Guys We Love.</p>

<p>John P. Perkins</p>

<p>by Micah Smith</p>

<p>Before entering ministry, John Perkins, pastor of Common Ground Covenant Church, made a name for himself in the food scene. At age 22, he became the executive chef for the Eagle Ridge Convention Center in Raymond.</p>

<p>It was after he and wife, Patrice, got married in 2006 that Perkins says he wanted to be a spiritual leader for his family and turned to the Bible. As he began to fall in love with the scriptures, his grandfather, pastor John M. Perkins, founder of the John &amp; Vera Mae Perkins Foundation, began mentoring him.</p>

<p>In 2009, Perkins began working with his grandfather's ministry, and in 2010, he began leading the Spencer Perkins Center in west Jackson. Then, three and a half years ago, he launched Common Ground with the goal of expanding their efforts in the area.</p>

<p>"It's what we do for the kingdom that's going to last, and the work we do in west Jackson is solely trying to meet Jesus where he's already at work in our neighborhood and in our community," he says.</p>

<p>In addition to promoting local business, arts and education through events such as Community Nights, Thinker's Fair and Taste of West Jackson, the church has a variety of mission-oriented programs, including English as a Second Language tutoring at Pecan Park Elementary School. Common Ground also recently launched a web platform, "Church in Community," designed to share program results and provide tools for others to replicate them nationally.</p>

<p>"We are asking people to get in the game, and I think there are also people who want to do more than stack chairs," Perkins says. "We're finding those people, or they're finding us."</p>

<p>Ahmad Thompson</p>

<p>Ahmad Thompson, 33, along with Garrad Lee, Michael Milnick, Bradley Adair and Thompson's brother Saddi Thompson, saw a need for a diverse gathering place in Fondren—a place that would be welcoming for all, Thompson says. That idea became The Flamingo.</p>

<p>Thompson, who is originally from Crystal Springs, graduated with a bachelor's in marketing from the University of Mississippi in 2008 and moved to Jackson in 2010. It was around that time that he and Saddi took over their father's construction company, Thompson and Thompson Construction and Roofing, which has been in the Jackson community for more than 25 years. Thompson is the construction manager, while Saddi handles business and marketing.</p>

<p>Since The Flamingo's opening in fall 2017, the venue has hosted everything from art shows to concerts to trivia nights.</p>

<p>"It's a place that's welcoming for all races, genders, gender identities, sexual orientations, religion, things like that," Thompson says. "That's what we want The Flamingo to be—a place where everybody can get together, and we can express people's ideas through art and music and just general congregation without fear of persecution or things like that."</p>

<p>The Flamingo also partners with organizations such as Planned Parenthood to hold events and fundraisers.</p>

<p>"We are able to support causes that we believe in," Thompson says. "The Flamingo gives us a vehicle to allow people to express themselves in a healthy environment."</p>

<p>Blake Case</p>

<p>For Blake Case, it's important to help the community, and he understands the role social media can play in that. Case is currently the manager of marketing and public awareness for the Women's Foundation of Mississippi, which seeks to create economic security for women in the state.</p>

<p>Case graduated from Mississippi State University with a bachelor's degree in social studies in 2013. From March 2014 to May 2017, he served as the social media manager for 42 for Better Schools, which appeared on the November 2016 ballot for public school funding.</p>

<p>He started in his position with the Women's Foundation in September 2017. The organization dedicates itself to funding programs that better the lives of women and girls in the state. The nonprofit also awards grants to programs that aid in social change such as ones that decrease unplanned pregnancies through accurate, evidence-based sexual education. In his position, Case focuses on communications strategy, media relations, digital marketing and more.</p>

<p>He has also contributed to social media for The Parent's Campaign, a public-education advocacy group.</p>

<p>He sees a need for media- and social-media savvy people in the nonprofit and community advocacy sectors.</p>

<p>"We're still trying to catch up to 2018," he says. "There's a limited number of people who know the basics of digital and social media, so I feel like I've been useful. There's a real need in our area for communicators and media-enriched people."</p>

<p>John Ruckdeschel</p>

<p>When John Ruckdeschel made the decision during his medical training to be an oncologist, it was not as common as it is today.</p>

<p>"It was a need to do it, and it was different," Ruckdeschel says. "Nobody in the '60s wanted to be an oncologist. There just wasn't a whole lot to do for patients with cancer. There weren't very many chemotherapy drugs, and it was a whole brand new field."</p>

<p>For him, the field represented promise because doctors were just beginning to understand how cancer works.</p>

<p>However, Ruckdeschel did not always plan to go into the medical field. In 1963, he began studying aeronautical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Then, in his second year, he realized he didn't want to go into that field. He decided to take courses for a pre-medical degree to see how he liked it.</p>

<p>"Math was never intuitive for me," Ruckdeschel says. "I had to work at it. Biology and how biological systems and how the human body works, it's all intuitive. Once I know one piece of it, the rest of it just falls into place."</p>

<p>He graduated from Rensselaer in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in biology and then received a medical degree from Albany Medical College in 1971. That year, he also began his internal medicine internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital before moving on to an oncology fellowship at the National Cancer Institute from 1972 to 1975. Finally, he completed his senior residency in internal medicine at Beth Israel Hospital in 1976.</p>

<p>Ruckdeschel, 71, has held positions such as president and chief executive officer of Moffitt Cancer Center and the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, and medical director of the oncology program and services at Intermountain Healthcare. In 2017, he became the director of the University of Mississippi Medical Center's Cancer Institute. Ruckdeschel says that working at UMMC gives him the opportunity to do what he does best: build and direct cancer centers.</p>

<p>"I love being the conductor rather than the violinist or the trombonist or whatever, getting everybody to play together and to work together," he says. "Cancer is a team sport. It really is. It requires teams to take care of people."</p>

<p>When not working, he enjoys spending time with his wife, Angela, and family, and loves to cook, travel and bird-watch.</p>

<p>Ronnie Crudup Jr.</p>

<p>Ronnie Crudup Jr., executive director of New Horizon Ministries Inc., has been hard at work in recent days fulfilling his organization's goal of making life better for residents of south Jackson.</p>

<p>Crudup, 41, is a lifelong Jackson resident and graduated from Murrah High School before attending Belhaven University, where he received a bachelor's degree in history in 2006.</p>

<p>"My family moved to south Jackson when I was a junior in high school for my father's church," he says. Other than a three-year period in north Jackson, he has lived there ever since.</p>

<p>"I got involved in the south Jackson community because my whole working life has been here, my family is here, and my children go to the local schools. I want the same quality of life found in others parts of town to be here."</p>

<p>The most recent project for New Horizon Ministries has been renovating the Terry Road swimming pool, which Crudup says has been closed for the better part of two years. New Horizon received a memorandum of understanding from the City to work on the pool in April and has since been painting, fixing leaks and providing other necessary repairs.</p>

<p>"We had painted that pool and tried to fix it up a few years ago because it's not far from our center, and our kids used it," Crudup says. "When it closed, and they couldn't use it anymore, we decided to take responsibility for it for both our kids and our community."</p>

<p>He oversaw a project in October 2017 to hire a Nashville artist, who was in town working on other projects, to paint a mural representing the south Jackson community over a formerly graffiti-covered wall at Tennis Center South. He has also been working to demolish abandoned houses and turn the properties into something positive for the community.</p>

<p>"Two months ago, we demolished an abandoned house off of Martin Luther King Drive near Lanier High School, and we recently did another one," he says. "We brought in a local gardener and landscaper named Hazzard Miller to help turn the first space into a community garden, and now residents maintain it and grow cucumbers, watermelon, tomatoes and other summer crops there."</p>

<p>D.J. Baker</p>

<p>Much of D.J. Baker's life has revolved around the connection between healthy food and family, starting when he would help his mother in the garden growing up.</p>

<p>In 2015, Baker chose to leave his hometown of Edmond, Okla., where his family has lived for more than a century, and joined FoodCorps as a service member. The national nonprofit sent him to Mississippi, where he worked to provide children in low-income areas with access to healthy food.</p>

<p>"That was showing kids how to garden and grow their own food, how to prepare food; talking about the good, the bad, the ugly and the beautiful of food in our everyday world; having conversations about culture, about what that looks like in history and what that looks like now," he says.</p>

<p>While Baker left FoodCorps earlier this year, he has continued his efforts to further nutrition education and sustainable farming here in Jackson. Since June 2017, he has been partnering with farmer Felicia Bell on RD &amp; S Farm, working to grow a diverse, sustainable farm in Brandon. In addition to farming, RD &amp; S offers educational materials, workshops and agricultural consultations.</p>

<p>Baker also works with the Alliance of Sustainable Farms, a Mississippi-based nonprofit that works to connect farmers throughout the state who want to address issues of sustainability. Among other projects, the organization offers a farmer-to-farmer mentoring program, and hosts events to help highlight and introduce local growers to the community.</p>

<p>In February 2018, Baker launched his own company, Esculent, which aims to get more people involved with growing their own food, both through education and the installation of home fruit, vegetable and herb gardens.</p>

<p>"If the concept is growing for community, (you should) allow the communities to grow some for themselves," Baker says. "You're not going to have families that are going to go out and do whole farms for themselves, you know? ... But you can cut grocery costs, and this is an opportunity for families to literally grow together."</p>

<p>Alan Grove</p>

<p>For eight years before moving to Jackson, Washington native Alan Grove was already building friendships here, where his brother Bryan had moved.</p>

<p>About a year after receiving a bachelor's degree in comparative history with a certificate in sales and marketing from the University of Washington, Grove was working for a video-production startup in Seattle. He had a conversation with one of his Jackson friends, Pastor John Perkins of Common Ground Covenant Church, who was in Seattle at the time, and told him that he was unsure about what to do with his life.</p>

<p>"I didn't know if I wanted to do social entrepreneurship with my life or if I wanted to be a pastor," Grove says, "so in our conversation, he described how he was both."</p>

<p>In May 2015, Grove moved to west Jackson and became the church's operations and production director. While he had almost a decade of connections in the area, he says the first step in getting involved was to ask what he could do.</p>

<p>"I went from a startup video production company to then a church plant, and really, in those environments, you do what needs to get done," he says.</p>

<p>"A lot of it was just seeing the vision or the end goal of the project, and filling in the gaps the best you can, adapting if necessary."</p>

<p>Grove, 26, has helped coordinate many events to promote west Jackson and tackle issues, including the Jubilee Conference, which brought together community leaders in January 2018 to consolidate efforts to fight poverty and provide resources. The church will host a "Community Night" summer series, featuring free events such as the Gospel Explosion on June 14 and Hip-Hop in the Park on July 12.</p>

<p>Austin Baney</p>

<p>Austin Baney, head trainer and co-owner of CrossFit Fondren (3002 N. Mill St., 769-208-6704), first heard about CrossFit in college.</p>

<p>"I didn't use to be an athletic kid growing up, but I later found that fitness was a great personal outlet for my wellbeing," Baney says. "I ... fell in love with their approach to health and fitness in the community."</p>

<p>Baney, 24, was born in Memphis, Tenn., and his family has lived in Madison since 2005. He graduated from Madison Central High School and went on to Mississippi College, where he received a bachelor's degree in social studies education in 2015.</p>

<p>He worked as a social studies teacher at Hardy Middle School in Jackson during the 2016-2017 school year.</p>

<p>During that time, he also worked part-time as a CrossFit trainer at Coyote CrossFit in Madison. He had not considered fitness as a career path until Lewis reached out to him in search of someone to coach classes ahead of CrossFit Fondren's August 2017 opening.</p>

<p>Baney currently handles the center's day-to-day operations, including coaching classes and managing CrossFit's social media marketing.</p>

<p>"I believe that physical health is connected to mental, emotional and spiritual health, and our approach at CrossFit works to help a person as a whole when they come here," he says.</p>

<p>Baney lives in Flowood with his wife, Caitlyn Baney.</p>

<h2 id="governorvowstofightfostercaretakeover">Governor Vows to Fight Foster Care Takeover</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-06</p>

<p>JACKSON — Gov. Phil Bryant seemed prepared to fight to keep control over Mississippi's foster-care system last week after attorneys representing the children asked U.S. District Judge Tom Lee to hold the State in contempt of court and to turn over the system to a court-appointed receiver.</p>

<p>"You've got to remember that these plaintiffs' attorneys make a lot of money keeping this case going," the governor told reporters at the Capitol last week.</p>

<p>"They do not want to settle it; they do not want to admit that we are making tremendous progress in Child Protection Services, so we intend to vigorously go and defend our position and our belief that we are in compliance."</p>

<p>The more-than-decade-old lawsuit against the foster-care system had turned into one settlement agreement after another, with the state making some progress in recent years. That is, until May 31 when the attorneys moved for the takeover.</p>

<p>As the Jackson Free Press previously reported, the State is out of compliance with the agreement leaders entered into, and the primary source of non-compliance is meeting the required caseload percentages. As a part of the agreement between CPS and attorneys suing on behalf of foster-care children, caseworkers at CPS are only allowed to have a set amount of cases each in order to ensure that each child in foster care receives the proper attention and care.</p>

<p>Out of Compliance</p>

<p>When all parties in the long-running "Olivia Y" lawsuit agreed to let 2017 be a year of growth without consequences for CPS, a very new state agency at the time, the understanding was that the State would be in compliance with the necessary caseload requirements by the end of the year. The State made progress in that area—but then plateaued.</p>

<p>In the fall, and by December 2017, 61 percent of the State's caseworkers were meeting their caseload percentages. The agreement required 90 percent. Attorneys waited before dragging the State back into court. They met with Commissioner Jess Dickinson, who was in the midst of budgetary challenges, in March. Since then, caseload percentage compliance has actually declined, court records show.</p>

<p>"We think without adequate caseloads, nothing else is going to work out in any kind of way...," Marcia Lowry, one of the lead attorneys who works with A Better Childhood, said. "... They need caseworkers, and they do not have them."</p>

<p>Dickinson expressed his need for more workers back in March, when he also went to the Legislature requesting deficit funds for the current fiscal year. More workers would lower the caseload number, presumably, because there would be more workers to take on the State's shrinking number of cases. And even though the State has lowered the number of children in foster care by nearly 700 kids in the past year, its caseload percentage has gotten worse—it's at 52 percent as of May. Dickinson and CPS would not comment on the impending litigation beyond a statement.</p>

<p>"Mississippi's foster-care system has made great strides and recorded significant improvement since MDCPS was established in 2016. We are confident we are moving in the right direction to ensure the continued protection and safety of at-risk children and their families," the statement says. "We disagree with the plaintiff's assertions and will continue working diligently each day to care for the thousands of abused and neglected children entrusted into our custody for protection."</p>

<p>Need for 'More Funding'</p>

<p>CPS is an executive-level agency, and Bryant appointed Dickinson to replace former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice David Chandler, who led CPS for a year and a half, and retired in August 2017.</p>

<p>The governor is relying on the State's progress and track record to fend off receivership. He is proud of the fact that the number of kids in custody has dropped from more than 6,000 a year ago to 5,403 currently. But even with that drop in children, due to either adoption or reunification, the state's caseload compliance has not improved.</p>

<p>Lowry said the State's noncompliance is likely a combination of both the agency's inability to retain workers, as well as organizational structure and leadership.</p>

<p>"We're not trying to micromanage the agency; we've just set standards that they have to meet, and they are not meeting them," she said.</p>

<p>The new motion for contempt says that several top-level CPS workers have left or will leave the agency this month. It even suggests that Dickinson is not the right leader for CPS.</p>

<p>"As will be shown at the hearing on the present motion, it is apparent that Commissioner Dickinson is simply not capable of operating the agency in such a way to achieve compliance with the Court's requirements," the court documents say.</p>

<p>Beyond shifting personnel levels, CPS might need more funds. CPS originally requested more than $249 million in funding for fiscal-year 2019, which begins July 1. Dickinson told the Jackson Free Press that this amount is not nearly enough to pay caseworkers what he needs to keep them from leaving. The Legislature appropriated over $247 million to CPS, however, and even Bryant admits the agency could use more funding.</p>

<p>"I wish we had more funding. I will tell you that this is something we should fund above all other things, and we will see how the Legislature continues to deal with that," Bryant said last week. "We need to hire more social workers. They are actually hard to find, and this is a tough job. So if you get a new social worker who comes right out of a university and realizes how tough it is, we lose a lot of them."</p>

<p>Only one other foster-care system in the country has entered receivership: Washington, D.C., back in the 1990s. Lowry was a part of that case, too.</p>

<p>Receivership is a drastic step, one that Lowry says she tries to avoid. But in Mississippi, it is too late, she maintains.</p>

<p>Now a judge must determine the fate and control of the more than 5,000 children in the State of Mississippi's custody.</p>

<p>JACKSON — A former Pelahatchie city clerk choked back tears in the backroom of Penn's Fish House in Brandon, as she described the events that caused her to walk out of the job on March 7. Ruby Burns-Ward said Mayor Ryshonda Harper Beechem created an environment of fear in City Hall, so she left a job she loved.</p>

<p>"I told the aldermen, I will not work by myself with her (Beechem)," Burns-Ward said. "She would text us at all times of the night. Any little thing that you said to her would set her off. I lived in constant fear. All day long, it was like she would try to set you up."</p>

<p>Ward One Alderman Michael Adams, former Mayor Knox Ross Jr., retired City Clerk Bettye Massey, Mayor Pro Tem Margie Warren, along with Burns-Ward, sat down with for an interview with the Jackson Free Press and The Clarion-Ledger on May 30, the first time many of them spoke to media since the failed audit was announced.</p>

<p>The day before Burns-Ward walked out, along with the other city clerk, Ellen Davis, Beechem sent a letter to all city employees. Prior to sending it, she emailed a copy to her attorney Thomas Bellinder, documents show.</p>

<p>In the letter, Beechem said some employees have shown a level of disrespect, and as the mayor it is her duty to make sure they are "abiding by the law."</p>

<p>"I will not be held in violation for any of you not abiding by the rules. If any of you have a problem working with me or for me then you may and to find something else," the letter says. "Your conduct from this point on will not be accepted, and I will continue to do what's right and lawful."</p>

<p>Beechem said she wanted people to do their jobs because when she does not know what is happening in the town, it reflects poorly on her.</p>

<p>"You cannot get mad at not wanting to land myself in jail because whether it's me or anybody else, we have a job to do. If it's the law, it's the law and if it's a statue, it's a statue," she said.</p>

<p>The board hired Davis to a part-time city clerk position at its June 4 meeting.</p>

<p>Elected to office in June 2017 by a margin of 12 votes, Beechem is the first black mayor in the county. She reports to the Board of Aldermen, which consists of two black men, two white men and a white woman.</p>

<p>Adams, who is black, said the issues between the board and mayor are not because of racism. Instead, Adams alleges the mayor simply wants publicity.</p>

<p>"If it's not a black issue or a race issue, what is it?" the mayor told the Jackson Free Press. "That's the question that I have that no one can answer."</p>

<p>The Finance Audit</p>

<p>A month into her term, Beechem called the state auditor about Pelahatchie's use of drug-seizure funds. Now, current and former aldermen, city employees, Ross and Beechem owe more than $500,000 total to the state for the misuse of the funds, the audit found.</p>

<p>Aldermen say that they did not misuse the money. They say drug-seizure money was used for law enforcement purposes only, as the law requires. The money did not pay general expenses, the issue is there's a disagreement with how the money was accounted for, Ross said.</p>

<p>"They have done us a favor by putting on record that nobody stole any money and there's nothing is missing," Ross, the former mayor, said.</p>

<p>One issue the audit raises is how now-retired clerk Massey, who is white, was paid. She made about $82,000 a year, in a town of about 1,300 people. Ross said it is because she worked for the city for 30 years and had a workload for one and a half people. However, there was another full-time clerk, Burns-Ward, and one part-time clerk, Ward.</p>

<p>In Walnut Grove, a town of 1,900 people with a full-time mayor, the city clerk makes $38,000 a year. In Ackerman, a town of 1,500 with a part-time mayor, the city clerk makes just under $50,000. In Byhalia, a town of 1,300 people with a full-time mayor, the city clerk makes $57,638, a Mississippi State University survey shows.</p>

<p>"How can we afford $82,000, but you're the same city clerk saying 'we're broke, we're broke, we're broke?'" Beechem said. "If we don't have the money, then why pay? Out of 1,400 people, our residence did not increase to 5,000 people." The Disagreements</p>

<p>On Jan. 30, Burns-Ward, who is white, and Beechem argued over user IDs and passwords. She said Beechem yelled at her, saying Burns-Ward was not supposed to talk to the aldermen at all because Beechem was her supervisor. Burns-Ward then threatened to videotape Beechem and went to her office. Burns-Ward texted her husband, asking him to come to City Hall because she was afraid. Her husband came, as did Sgt. Timothy Fikes and Police Chief Keith Poole, Burns-Ward said.</p>

<p>Beechem told the Jackson Free Press she called Poole and asked him to come because she feared for her safety.</p>

<p>Warren was also at City Hall and went to talk to Beechem after the police arrived. "I open the door, and I go in, and she starts yelling 'Get out, get out, get out.' I say, 'what on earth is wrong with you?' (Beechem responds:) 'Get out. It's because of you and that mayor and that board.' She was slinging stuff off of her desk," Warren said.</p>

<p>Beechem said she never threw stuff. Instead, Beechem said Warren accused her of bugging the office phones.</p>

<p>"I asked her, 'Where are the bugs? Take me to them right now. Where are the bugs?'" Beechem said. "They couldn't move. (Warren responds:) 'You can't reason with her.' She walks out."</p>

<p>The Pelahatchie Municipal Court said there is no police report from that day. Police Chief Kevin Poole said he did go to City Hall that day, but did not file a report because no charges were pressed. When he responded, the mayor was upstairs and the city clerks were downstairs.</p>

<p>JACKSON — It has been almost four years since the Mississippi Department of Corrections was turned upside down after a federal grand jury indicted former Commissioner Christopher Epps on several counts of wire fraud, bribery and money laundering.</p>

<p>The grand jury indicted Epps and former Mississippi legislator Cecil McCrory on Nov. 6, 2014. The next day, Gov. Phil Bryant wrote an executive order directing the interim commissioner to rebid any contract that was caught up in the Epps scandal and ordered a comprehensive review of MDOC's contracting and procurement process. Gov. Bryant created a task force to examine MDOC's contracting process.</p>

<p>On July 31, 2015, Bryant issued another executive order, asking MDOC to become a "Certified Purchasing Office" by March 31, 2016. More than two years after that deadline, MDOC finally achieved that status late last year when Victor Cavett, an accountant in MDOC's purchasing office, received his universal certification as a professional public buyer.</p>

<p>Now MDOC is one of 10 certified purchasing offices in the state. Ross Campbell, director of purchasing, travel and fleet management in the Department of Finance and Administration, said the distinction allow an agency to issue a request-for-proposal for commodities or services. In MDOC's case, commodities contracts are predominantly with food and uniform vendors, Transparency Mississippi shows.</p>

<p>"If they want to do an RFP for commodities or services ..., they do not have to come to the board to get approval to do it," Campbell told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Even as a certified purchasing office, MDOC must still comply with state law and bring all contracts not characterized as "non-IT commodity" to the contract review board. MDOC, like all state agencies, must purchase from vendors registered with the state.</p>

<p>MDOC operates with a more than $341-million budget, and Cavett estimates that the agency could spend $100,000 or more in a week. The cost per inmate per day varies, but in 2016 was valued at $49.79, a 2016 Joint Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review report says. The cost for inmates in regional facilities and private prisons is lower than that. MDOC is required to spend less (10 percent) on private-prison inmates, state law says. With the number of incarcerated Mississippians hovering at around 21,000 and then 32,635 men and women on parole or probation, MDOC's costs are constant.</p>

<p>Cavett expressed the importance of maintaining independence when procuring contracts.</p>

<p>"We have to make certain that the items are competitively procured," Cavett said in a press release.</p>

<p>"That is to say, that we have enough quotes or submissions from vendors to ensure that we are getting good prices."</p>

<p>His caution is likely, in part, due to the governor's executive orders, as well as budget challenges. MDOC posted a budget deficit last year, causing the agency to scale back operations at South Mississippi Correctional Facility. Immediately after the 2018 legislative session, sheriffs gathered at the Capitol to complain about MDOC removing inmates from regional facilities, which sheriffs' departments statewide rely on for their own budgets.</p>

<p>Beyond commodity contracts, previously, PEER has encouraged MDOC to renegotiate the state's private-prison contracts with the Management and Training Corporation. In federal court earlier this year, MDOC officials revealed that the state's contracts with MTC and with medical provider, Centurion, required such low staffing levels that both MTC and Centurion additional staff beyond their contractual obligations at their own expense.</p>

<p>Separately, costs at MDOC largely reflect the inmate population, and after statewide criminal-justice reform in 2014, the number of incarcerated Mississippians dropped; however, in the past year, that number has inched back up.</p>

<p>Cavett is the primary contractor in the MDOC office and the only purchasing agent with universal certification.</p>

<h2 id="specialsessiontofundroadsbridgesmaydependonussupremecourt">Special Session to Fund Roads, Bridges May Depend on U.S. Supreme Court</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-04</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/04/special-session-fund-roads-bridges-may-depend-us-s/ </p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant said combining sports betting, online sales tax and state lottery revenues could come close to the needed amount to maintain the state's infrastructure funding. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant alluded to the possibility of a special session for infrastructure funding, if the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to start collecting use tax from online retailers.</p>

<p>Last week, he told reporters at the Capitol that he is watching how the U.S. Supreme Court decides the South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc. case, with a ruling expected this summer. If the high court reverses precedent from what is known as the Quill case, states can begin collecting use tax from online retailers. Currently, sales tax is only collected from brick-and-mortar retailers.</p>

<p>Many online retailers have started to collect the tax voluntarily. Amazon began collecting use tax from Mississippi shoppers last year, prompting Republican House leaders to propose several infrastructure funding legislative remedies that include diverting the new use tax to funds for roads and bridges.</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves has been skeptical about beginning to divert the use tax collected from online retailers to roads and bridges, citing constitutionality concerns in the past. But if the Supreme Court makes it legal, Bryant believes that is a green light for more road and bridge funding.</p>

<p>"(The Internet tax is) a tremendous amount of money that's being generated here in the state of Mississippi that we think could be identified for supporting infrastructure," Bryant said last week.</p>

<p>He also pointed to the Supreme Court's recent decision that allows states to legalize sports betting, which he said could generate around $30 million in revenue here in Mississippi. The governor also continues to support a state lottery.</p>

<p>"I believe a state lottery should be passed; I think we have the votes to do that," he said at the Capitol last week. "That could be anywhere between $70 (million) and $80 million. If you start putting those revenue numbers together, you're getting very close to the number I think that we need to support our infrastructure problems."</p>

<p>House Speaker Philip Gunn and Reeves could not come to an agreement about road and bridge funding during the 2018 legislative session, and following the session, Bryant was forced to close 83 bridges in the state after federal transportation officials threatened the state with losing federal funds if he did not.</p>

<p>Gunn does not support a lottery, and he formed a committee to study the lottery, which came to no legislative conclusion. The House body, however, successfully voted in favor of a state lottery this past session, although that provision was removed from the state gaming commission's budget bill in conference and did not become law. It is unclear how a lottery provision would hold up in the Senate, but Bryant said he had the votes in both chambers.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Economic Council released a report a few years ago estimating the state needs $375 million annually to repair and restore roads and bridges that have gone without upkeep since the last time the Legislature implemented a road program in 1987.</p>

<p>One proposal that will likely not come into play is raising the state's gasoline tax, which has remained flat since 1987 because it was not designed to adjust with inflation. Reeves has adamantly opposed tax increases, including on the gasoline tax. In April, Gunn proposed a "tax swap" that would eliminate the 4-percent income-tax bracket while increasing the gas tax.</p>

<h2 id="report110confederatemonumentsremovedinussince2015">Report: 110 Confederate Monuments Removed in US Since 2015</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-03</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/04/report-110-confederate-monuments-removed-us-2015/ </p>

<p>The study—released Monday by the Southern Poverty Law Center—shows that 110 Confederate monuments have been removed nationwide since 2015, when a shooting at a black church in South Carolina energized a movement against such memorials. Photo by Donna Ladd</p>

<p>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — It took generations to erect all the nation's Confederate monuments, and a new report shows they're being removed at a pace of about three each month.</p>

<p>The study—released Monday by the Southern Poverty Law Center—shows that 110 Confederate monuments have been removed nationwide since 2015, when a shooting at a black church in South Carolina energized a movement against such memorials.</p>

<p>The number—which includes schools and roads that have been renamed in California, a repurposed Confederate holiday in Georgia, plus rebel flags and monuments that have been taken down in Alabama, Louisiana and elsewhere—represents a relative handful compared with the more than 1,700 memorials that remain to hail the Southern "lost cause."</p>

<p>But the change is notable considering that removing such memorials wasn't widely discussed until the killing of nine black people at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a liberal activist organization based in Montgomery that monitors extremism. White supremacist Dylann Roof has been sentenced to death for the 2015 attack.</p>

<p>After the Charleston shooting, photos surfaced of Roof posing with the Confederate battle flag, helping to change the national dialogue.</p>

<p>"I think it kind of signifies something monumental," said Beirich, director of the organization's Intelligence Project. "I think people are finally willing to confront the history and come to terms with it."</p>

<p>Many of the Confederate monuments that are now controversial were erected in the early 1900s by groups composed of women and veterans. Some honor generals or soldiers; others bear inscriptions that critics say wrongly gloss over slavery as a reason for the war or portray the Confederate cause as noble.</p>

<p>The Old South monuments are supported by groups including the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which is erecting new memorials even as others are removed.</p>

<p>"They're taking them down, and we're putting them up," said Thomas V. Strain Jr., commander in chief of the organization. He said the group isn't tracking monument removals or name changes, but to him, 110 "seems a little high."</p>

<p>Members have raised two giant Confederate "mega-flags" on private property and erected four monuments in Alabama alone this year, Strain said, and they're asking to place a new Confederate monument outside the courthouse in Colbert County, in northwest Alabama. Commissioners are considering the request.</p>

<p>The organization also is building a new headquarters that will include The National Confederate Museum in Columbia, Tennessee. The organization, on its website promoting the project, said the museum will counter attempts by opponents "to ban any and all things Confederate through their ideological fascism."</p>

<p>The museum will tell the "Southern side" of the war, Strain said.</p>

<p>"It's not just dedicated to the soldiers, it's dedicated to the wives and children who had to endure that five years of hell also," he said. "We'll have Southern uniforms there, not Union uniforms. We'll have Southern artillery shells, not Northern ones."</p>

<p>Beirich said the law center's list of monument removals was compiled through news accounts, tips and crowd-sourcing sites that let people make online reports.</p>

<p>Both in tallying removals and remaining memorials, the group counted only monuments that "glorify" the Confederacy and didn't consider historical markers that denote specific events or sites with a link to the past, such as informative signs at battlefields, Beirich said.</p>

<p>While the organization lists 1,730 Confederate monuments nationwide, Beirich said there's no doubt a lot more exist.</p>

<p>"I am sure we have missed many," she said.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Grand jurors in Mississippi's most populous county have declined to indict four officers involved in recent shooting deaths.</p>

<p>Hinds County grand jurors declined to indict Rakasha Adams or Albert Taylor, two officers who grand jurors say were involved in the Jan. 27 shooting death of Crystalline Barnes. Family members of Barnes have alleged that officers were not justified in shooting the 21-year-old woman. Police say Barnes was driving her vehicle toward officers.</p>

<p>Jurors also declined to indict Adams in a 2017 shooting death.</p>

<p>Also not indicted were officers Roy Dickerson and Warren Hull. The Clarion Ledger reports the narcotics officers were investigating possible drug activity when they came in contact with two men who immediately ran. Police say 37-year-old Lee Edward Bonner was shot after he fired at officers.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi easily won a Republican primary Tuesday, months after being endorsed by President Donald Trump and the same day Trump tweeted that the legislator "has my total support!"</p>

<p>Wicker served nearly 13 years in the U.S. House before then-Gov. Haley Barbour appointed him to the Senate in late 2007 when fellow Republican Trent Lott resigned. Wicker's opponent in the November race isn't decided, as the Democratic primary heads to a June runoff.</p>

<p>Wicker, of Tupelo, defeated one GOP primary challenger who ran a low-budget campaign, business owner Richard Boyanton of Diamondhead.</p>

<p>Voter Mark Wall of Madison said he supported Wicker because of his conservative values and advocacy for the state: "He's done a lot to bring stuff to Mississippi that we need."</p>

<p>Six Democrats ran, and the top two headed to the June 26 runoff are state Rep. David Baria of Bay St. Louis, who looked to come in second place to venture capitalist Howard Sherman, who's married to TV and movie actress Sela Ward.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Wicker told The Associated Press: "It does seem based on statements coming from the various Democratic campaigns that opposition to the Trump agenda will be front and center in their emphasis. I don't think that sounds like a winner in Mississippi."</p>

<p>Mississippi is heavily Republican; it last had a Democrat in the Senate in 1989, when John C. Stennis retired.</p>

<p>Baria is an attorney and served one state Senate term before being elected in 2011 to the Republican-led Mississippi House, where he's now the Democratic leader. He criticizes Republicans for cutting taxes and refusing to expand Medicaid.</p>

<p>"The race now will be between a Mississippi Democrat and a California Republican," Baria said in a statement Tuesday night. "I'm ready for that race and I look forward to three more weeks of talking to the Mississippians I grew up with and have lived and worked with all my life."</p>

<p>Sherman and Ward raised their two children in Los Angeles, where he grew up, and the couple now lives near her hometown of Meridian, Mississippi. Sherman said Tuesday night that he had run against a "closed club" of experienced politicians who wrangled endorsements from other officeholders.</p>

<p>"All I had was a new way, a plan, accountability and a new Mississippi, and that's what people responded to," Sherman said.</p>

<p>As Sherman and Ward campaigned Tuesday at a soul food restaurant in Jackson, Ward told voter Harry Levy Jr. that Wicker has had a long career in Washington, serving in the House 13 years before moving to the Senate in late 2007 — and, she said, Mississippi is still poor.</p>

<p>"He's been in office 23 years, and we're still 50th," Ward said.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A district attorney and a former state development executive will meet in a runoff for the Republican nomination for an open congressional seat.</p>

<p>Michael Guest and Whit Hughes led the vote-getters Tuesday in the Republican contest in Mississippi's 3rd Congressional District.</p>

<p>Hughes said at his election watch party, "I've always been an underdog... if I make a runoff, I promise we'll be ready for it." The Jackson Free Press told him as he came off the stage that he had, indeed, made the runoff. He said he's not afraid to be the underdog going into it.</p>

<p>Guest is chief prosecutor in the Jackson suburbs of Madison and Rankin counties.</p>

<p>Hughes was deputy director of the Mississippi Development Authority under Gov. Haley Barbour after serving as his campaign finance director for his 2003 campaign. He's now a fundraiser for the Baptist hospital system.</p>

<p>Both attended Mississippi State University, where Hughes was a basketball player. Guest also received his law degree from the University of Mississippi.</p>

<p>They led four other candidates Tuesday, with no one winning a majority.</p>

<p>The district has been represented for 10 years by retiring Republican Gregg Harper.</p>

<p>Hughes and Guest were the top two fundraisers, with Hughes raising $430,000 and Guest raising $400,000.</p>

<h2 id="bodycamscommunitypolicingmentalhealthfundsonjpdsdojwishlist">Body Cams, Community Policing, Mental Health Funds on JPD's DOJ Wish List</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-30</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/31/body-cams-community-policing-mental-health-funds-j/ </p>

<p>In an interview, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore talked about securing body cameras and working on community policing. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Jackson Police Department hopes to equip its officers with body cameras and increase its "community policing" capacity with funds from U.S. Department of Justice. Pending grant applications also ask the DOJ for assistance with mental-health training.</p>

<p>Funds for body cameras would come from the U.S. Department of Justice's Body-Worn Camera Policy and Implementation Program. The grant requires a 50-percent match fund match, and JPD has requested $600,000 from the DOJ.</p>

<p>"The (Body-Worn Camera Policy and Implementation Program) addresses the development and implementation of policies and practices for effective program adoption, and includes factors such as the purchase, deployment, and maintenance of camera systems and equipment; data storage and access; and privacy considerations," the program description reads.</p>

<p>Officer-involved shootings have plagued Jackson in the last year, with at least seven since last July. JPD does not traditionally identify officers who fire on residents or the specific circumstances of the incidents. Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has convened a task force to recommend an updated policy on officer-involved shootings, which has met for two months to date.</p>

<p>The Jackson City Council unanimously gave its support to the body-camera application due on the last day of May. But, some brought up concerns about policy around the cameras should the City receive them.</p>

<p>"People have a right to privacy," Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps said at the May 22 city council meeting. "If a police officer shows up to a domestic situation, should the public be able to do an open-records request for those moments?"</p>

<p>Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes said he hopes the grant helps with community trust.</p>

<p>Body cameras, while helpful in some cases, are not cure-alls. A BuzzFeed News investigation from January 2017 titled "Blue Lies Matter" showed that video evidence opened a floodgate into the reality that sometimes officers tell a different story from what the cameras reveal.</p>

<p>"Cameras prove cops lie, and there are more cameras out in the world today than ever before," BuzzFeed reporter Albert Samaha wrote in the article. "... Officers lie in high-profile cases and little-known cases, and lie by fabrication, omission and exaggeration." Mitigating Risks of Body Cameras</p>

<p>The nation saw broader demand for body cameras following the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Mo., as an unbiased intermediary to reveal the facts of a case. A 2017 report on body-worn cameras points to the benefit of transparency, but the need for policies to protect the community.</p>

<p>"[C]ameras could be used to intensify disproportionate surveillance and enforcement in heavily policed communities of color," The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights &amp; Upturn report reads. "Without carefully crafted policy safeguards in place, there is a real risk that these new devices could become instruments of injustice, rather than tools for accountability."</p>

<p>The city council also approved JPD to move forward with an application for The Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program under the DOJ. This grant program would give JPD the funds to "support cross-system collaboration to improve responses and outcomes for individuals with mental illnesses or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse who come into contact with the justice system."</p>

<p>The DOJ program description also points to the national surge in suicides and how untreated mental illness can lead to self-injury. In 2016, more suicides than homicides occurred in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Community Policing: Proactive Efficiency</p>

<p>The council also approved the police department moving forward with a grant to help the City implement community-policing strategies. The DOJ's Community Policing Development funds will give up to $10 million subject to availability to fund projects related to "increase awareness of effective community policing strategies, increase the skills and abilities of law enforcement and community partners, increase the number of law enforcement agencies and relevant stakeholders using proven community policing practices and institutionalize community policing practice in routine business," the application description reads.</p>

<p>"Community policing" is a popular buzz phrase in law enforcement that is often used just to indicate police interacting with the community more often, but crime experts warn that there is much more to community policing if meaning change is to result.</p>

<p>The Community Oriented Policing Services division of the DOJ has explained that it is a strategy for law enforcement to be "proactive" rather than to just react to crimes after they occur or with traditional police practices.</p>

<p>"Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion," the COPS website explains. "Rather than responding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses."</p>

<p>In many cities, including New York City, community-policing strategies have resulted in an overhaul of the police beat system, with more officers walking the streets of neighborhoods rather than riding in squad cars in order to react better with residents and potential criminals. This can increase intelligence gathering and builds better relationships, including with young people at risk of making poor decisions.</p>

<p>It also means looking harder at the causes of crime in order to prevent them. "Community policing puts new emphasis on tackling the underlying causes of crime by addressing problems at the grassroots level," a DOJ Bureau of Justice Assistance report explained.</p>

<h2 id="bodycamscommunitypolicingmentalhealthfundsonjpdsdojwishlist-1">Body Cams, Community Policing, Mental Health Funds on JPD's DOJ Wish List</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p>In an interview, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore talked about securing body cameras and working on community policing. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Jackson Police Department hopes to equip its officers with body cameras and increase its "community policing" capacity with funds from U.S. Department of Justice. Pending grant applications also ask the DOJ for assistance with mental-health training.</p>

<p>Funds for body cameras would come from the U.S. Department of Justice's Body-Worn Camera Policy and Implementation Program. The grant requires a 50-percent match fund match, and JPD has requested $600,000 from the DOJ.</p>

<p>"The (Body-Worn Camera Policy and Implementation Program) addresses the development and implementation of policies and practices for effective program adoption, and includes factors such as the purchase, deployment, and maintenance of camera systems and equipment; data storage and access; and privacy considerations," the program description reads.</p>

<p>Officer-involved shootings have plagued Jackson in the last year, with at least seven since last July. JPD does not traditionally identify officers who fire on residents or the specific circumstances of the incidents. Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has convened a task force to recommend an updated policy on officer-involved shootings, which has met for two months to date.</p>

<p>The Jackson City Council unanimously gave its support to the body-camera application due on the last day of May. But, some brought up concerns about policy around the cameras should the City receive them.</p>

<p>"People have a right to privacy," Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps said at the May 22 city council meeting. "If a police officer shows up to a domestic situation, should the public be able to do an open-records request for those moments?"</p>

<p>Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes said he hopes the grant helps with community trust.</p>

<p>Body cameras, while helpful in some cases, are not cure-alls. A BuzzFeed News investigation from January 2017 titled "Blue Lies Matter" showed that video evidence opened a floodgate into the reality that sometimes officers tell a different story from what the cameras reveal.</p>

<p>"Cameras prove cops lie, and there are more cameras out in the world today than ever before," BuzzFeed reporter Albert Samaha wrote in the article. "... Officers lie in high-profile cases and little-known cases, and lie by fabrication, omission and exaggeration." Mitigating Risks of Body Cameras</p>

<p>The nation saw broader demand for body cameras following the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Mo., as an unbiased intermediary to reveal the facts of a case. A 2017 report on body-worn cameras points to the benefit of transparency, but the need for policies to protect the community.</p>

<p>"[C]ameras could be used to intensify disproportionate surveillance and enforcement in heavily policed communities of color," The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights &amp; Upturn report reads. "Without carefully crafted policy safeguards in place, there is a real risk that these new devices could become instruments of injustice, rather than tools for accountability."</p>

<p>The city council also approved JPD to move forward with an application for The Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program under the DOJ. This grant program would give JPD the funds to "support cross-system collaboration to improve responses and outcomes for individuals with mental illnesses or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse who come into contact with the justice system."</p>

<p>The DOJ program description also points to the national surge in suicides and how untreated mental illness can lead to self-injury. In 2016, more suicides than homicides occurred in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Community Policing: Proactive Efficiency</p>

<p>The council also approved the police department moving forward with a grant to help the City implement community-policing strategies. The DOJ's Community Policing Development funds will give up to $10 million subject to availability to fund projects related to "increase awareness of effective community policing strategies, increase the skills and abilities of law enforcement and community partners, increase the number of law enforcement agencies and relevant stakeholders using proven community policing practices and institutionalize community policing practice in routine business," the application description reads.</p>

<p>"Community policing" is a popular buzz phrase in law enforcement that is often used just to indicate police interacting with the community more often, but crime experts warn that there is much more to community policing if meaning change is to result.</p>

<p>The Community Oriented Policing Services division of the DOJ has explained that it is a strategy for law enforcement to be "proactive" rather than to just react to crimes after they occur or with traditional police practices.</p>

<p>"Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion," the COPS website explains. "Rather than responding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses."</p>

<p>In many cities, including New York City, community-policing strategies have resulted in an overhaul of the police beat system, with more officers walking the streets of neighborhoods rather than riding in squad cars in order to react better with residents and potential criminals. This can increase intelligence gathering and builds better relationships, including with young people at risk of making poor decisions.</p>

<p>It also means looking harder at the causes of crime in order to prevent them. "Community policing puts new emphasis on tackling the underlying causes of crime by addressing problems at the grassroots level," a DOJ Bureau of Justice Assistance report explained.</p>

<p>In order for police to better ineract with the community in ways that might prevent crime, they require more training and, often, a shift a mindset about police work. The public must think about policing differently as well, including only using 911 to report true emergencies.</p>

<p>"To maximize the time that the patrol officer can spend interacting with community members, community policing encourages the use of the 911 system only for true emergencies. Nonemergency calls should be handled through other means, including delays in responding and report handling by the police station or sheriff's office over the telephone or by mail," that report said.</p>

<h2 id="cityfinancedirectorannounceslastdayduringharshauditreport">City Finance Director Announces Last Day During Harsh Audit Report</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Marie Weidmayer</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-31</p>

<p>Department of Finance and Administration Director Charles Hatcher addressed the Finance Committee on May 31, confirming that it was his last day with the City of Jackson. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Charles Hatcher's last day with the City of Jackson is today—Thursday, May 31.</p>

<p>The director of the Department of Finance and Administration's departure surfaced publicly for the first time at a Finance Committee meeting this afternoon, while the committee discussed why the budget audit—started in November 2017—is not complete.</p>

<p>The news broke today when Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote asked Hatcher if the department was prepared for his departure.</p>

<p>"Dr. Hatcher, we have enjoyed your time with us," Ward 2 Councilman Melvin Priester Jr. said. "It might be contentious, but it's the situation Jackson's in and its passion. But thank you very much and good luck."</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba was not at the meeting. He told the Jackson Free Press via text that he is en route to the 2018 Labor Research and Action Network national conference in Nashville where he is a keynote speaker.</p>

<p>However, "there is a plan in place" for Hatcher's departure, Lumumba texted the Jackson Free Press, but he did not elaborate. He said a city representative would contact the JFP to discuss Hatcher's departure but that did not happen by press time. However, a statement arrived in email within an hour, saying that Hatcher had resigned for "personal reasons."</p>

<p>The statement did not name an interim director, however. "We have identified an individual to step in and serve in Dr. Hatcher's stead until a permanent replacement can be found," Lumumba said in the statement. "This individual has an abundance of financial experience working with municipalities across the nation, and we are confident that they will continue to move our city forward in the interim."</p>

<p>Hatcher is leaving the city one month before the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) is due to Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), on June 30. Auditor Scott Hodges said at the budget meeting that Tann, Brown and Russ Co. is prepared to work with Hatcher's staff after his departure.</p>

<p>The audit started in November, but a lack of information given to the auditors from the City slowed the process down. Originally, the audit was scheduled to be completed in January, Hodges said.</p>

<p>"There's nothing we're asking for that shouldn't be readily available if the internal controls were in place and proper processes were in place," Hodges said. "This is all stuff that should have been done monthly. So from that standpoint at the end of October, all of this information should have been ready, if it had been done properly throughout the year as it should have been done."</p>

<p>Auditors discovered numerous discrepancies during the audit, but until it is complete, it is impossible to know the total number of discrepancies or how much it amounts to, as they could increase or decrease, Hodges said.</p>

<p>Technically the audit doesn't indicate fraud, Hodges said, but added that there's more to it than that. "The CAFR has been produced and signed off on by multiple people, so if that's fraud, that's every man's definition," he said.</p>

<p>There are material weaknesses "everywhere I look," Hodges said. A material weakness is one or more deficiencies with the reasonable possibility that mistakes on a financial statement cannot be prevented or detected, according to the Public Accounting Oversight Board.</p>

<p>If the audit was to be completed today, the City would receive an adverse opinion, which means its financial statements do not fairly represent the actual financial position, Hodges said.</p>

<p>"It's kind of a big deal, but getting an adverse opinion would be a bigger deal," Priester said. "I would like as we go through this, I hope sooner than later we get a better ideal for scope of any revisions and how far they go back."</p>

<p>In his statement, Lumumba wished Hatcher well. "We appreciate the hard work and innovation of Dr. Charles Hatcher during his tenure as director of the Department of Administration. His resignation was fueled by personal reasons. We wish him the best in his future endeavors," the statement said.</p>

<p>Hatcher's salary was just over $105,000—approximately a 24-percent increase over the woman in that role under Yarber, Michelle Battee-Day.</p>

<p>JACKSON — At least six people in Mississippi and Texas could face life in prison after a group of federal, state and local law enforcement seized more than 40 kilograms of methamphetamine, 3 kilograms of cocaine and 100 pounds of marijuana near Philadelphia, Miss., on May 30 in a coordinated drug raid. Federal agencies involved in the raids include ICE's Homeland Security Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, along with multiples local agencies.</p>

<p>"These arrests are the culmination of an extensive Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force investigation dubbed 'Operation Highlife,' which targeted illegal narcotics distribution in this part of our state," U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said at a press conference in the federal courthouse in downtown Jackson Thursday. "This particular illegal drug activity has been occurring in the East Central Mississippi area for the last several years."</p>

<p>The task force arrested 11 people, with their indictment unsealed Wednesday. Their arraignment is June 1.</p>

<p>At least 15 federal, state and local law enforcement organizations worked together for the task force, which covers Texas, California, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, Hurst said.</p>

<p>"These arrests and the dismantling of this drug-trafficking network is exactly what the OCDETF program was created to do," Hurst said. "As you can see this was a complete joint effort that led to the success and the arrest yesterday."</p>

<p>To end this trafficking ring effectively, it had to be hit all at once, not just arresting individual purchasers or dealers, Hurst said.</p>

<p>"I think the message is clear that we are not going to stop. We're going to come together, we're going to work together with law enforcement across county lines, across district lines," Hurst said. "When we come together there is no one that can avoid us, there is no one that can hide from us and we're going to make sure that we put an end to this kind of criminal activity in the Southern District of Mississippi."</p>

<p>The arrests only represent accusations, and those charged are innocent until proved guilty. "Operation Highlife" arrested the following 11 people:</p>

<p>Brandon Deshanta Miller, 32, of Dallas, Texas, is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth, possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth and felon in possession of a firearm. Miller faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $30.25 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Shandlette Hudson, 42, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth and possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth. Hudson faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $20 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Dijon James Seales, 28, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth, possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth, possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of meth, felon in possession of a firearm and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime. Seales faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $25.5 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Lorenzo Dyrell Hickman, 32, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine. Hickman faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $20 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Latrice Cherrell Boler, 29, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth. Boler faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $10 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Chaddis Demond McAfee, 36, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of meth, felon in possession of a firearm and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. McAfee faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $10.5 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Courtny Orlando Campbell, 27, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth. Campbell faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $10 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Danny L. Drake, 43, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth. Drake faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and up to a $5 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Kevin Ashley Wells, 37, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of meth. Wells faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>Jimmie Terrell Harrison, 43, of Forest, Miss., is charged with felon in possession of a firearm. Harrison faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Tray Beamon, 32, of Louisville, Miss., is charged with possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth. Beamon faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $20 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Hurst, appointed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, announced a coordinated, late-night "surge" inside Jackson in April as part of what he dubs "Project Eject." He later announced 45 arrests for a mix of drug, gang and weapons charges. The Jackson Free Press has requested the names of the people arrested and their charges multiple times, including at the press conference for "Operation Highlife," but Hurst has declined repeatedly to provide that information.</p>

<p>"Project Eject" is part of Sessions' return to a "Project Safe Neighborhood" strategy of federal arrests for gun charges and his pledge to renew emphasis on drug enforcement.</p>

<p>Update: The Green Eyeshade Awards from the southeastern division of the Society of Professional Journalists, announced Friday, June 8, that the Jackson Free Press has won "Best in Division," one of the contest's top awards, for our juvenile-justice reporting and commentary in 2017. This is the second year in a row the JFP has taken "Best in Division" for work related to young people and violence prevention in Mississippi. This brings the JFP's total Eyeshade awards to six this year, which includes the public-service award for juvenile justice work announced previously.</p>

<p>Reporters Ko Bragg and Arielle Dreher, along with editor-in-chief Donna Ladd, took first place in public service in the non-daily news division for the team's reporting in 2017 on juvenile justice in Mississippi. The award honored 15 stories and columns last year about failed efforts to expand the state gang law; the effort for criminal-justice reform in the Legislature, the lack of resources for young people needing mental-health and trauma treatment; the lack of violence prevention for young people growing up in poverty; the lack of evidence-based policing strategies, and even how scientific racism has influenced today's juvenile-justice policy.</p>

<p>The recognized public-service work also included Ko Bragg's investigation of the Jackson Police Department's distribution of juvenile mugshots and allowing select "perp walks" for media cameras, including of unconvicted juveniles. Her work prompted Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba to sign an executive order stopping those practices.</p>

<p>Last year's Green Eyeshade Awards also honored the JFP's ongoing juvenile-justice work, which has been supported in recent years by fellowships and grants from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, the Quattrone Center at Penn Law and the Solutions Journalism Network. Donna Ladd's long-form "Hunger to Live" story series on the Washington Addition won Best in Division in 2017, with photojournalism by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>In the 2018 awards, the JFP also won the following four awards, continuing the tradition of the locally owned news outlet being one of the top awards recipients in the competition as well as the top Mississippi winner. The JFP also continued its tradition of winning Green Eyeshade Awards for editorials and commentary:</p>

<p>• Editorials, 2nd place: JFP Editorial Board, Editorials 2017</p>

<p>• Feature writing, 3rd place: Arielle Dreher, "Still Fighting at Home: Transgender Veterans Caught in</p>

<p>the Flux"</p>

<p>• Courts and the Law reporting, 3rd place: Ko Bragg, "Hinds DA on Trial, Again"</p>

<p>The Green Eyeshades includes journalism by daily, non-daily, TV, radio, college and online-only outlets in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. It will announce its best of division awards the week of June 4.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A Mississippi police officer has been fired after being accused of using excessive force against a 19-year-old basketball player.</p>

<p>Interim Jackson Police Chief Anthony Moore said officer Vincent Lampkin was fired after an "extensive investigation," and asked citizens not to judge the entire department by "one bad actor."</p>

<p>John Knight III told authorities that the officer pulled him over in May and attacked him as he got out of his vehicle. He said the officer handcuffed and punched him, put a gun to his head, threw his phone into the grass when he asked to call his father, and then ultimately let him go without charges.</p>

<p>Knight, a standout point guard, was pulled over and beaten only a week after Utah State signed him to a scholarship.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press reached out to all candidates in the four Mississippi Congressional districts who are listed on a primary election ballot on June 5, regardless of whether they had a challenger or not. Each candidate received the same five-question questionnaire. We've published their responses in full below, with minimal edits for editorial/reader clarity only. The JFP did not copyedit or line-edit candidate responses. The views expressed by candidates do not necessarily reflect the views of the JFP.</p>

<p>Why does your district need you right now? </p>

<p>For too long equal representation has been inaccessible to the common citizens of Mississippi. Unless you are big business, a healthcare executive or already in the government; the average Mississippian’s voice has not been heard. I am tired of the politicians dividing and bullying the people of our State. My district needs people that will stand up against inequality and injustice. We need accountability and transparency for our elected. I cannot undertake this alone, I need your help. If you want to make a difference, if you feel called to be a part of a movement, or you want to be a part of the future; I am asking that you join us and volunteer. Join our team and let us make a difference. Click on the Volunteer button on the www.aycoxforcongress.com and let us change Mississippi together.</p>

<p>Provide one or two examples of when you have been an advocate in your personal or professional life. </p>

<p>While stationed in Jacksonville Florida serving in the US NAVY I served as a SAPR (sexual assault prevention and response) advocate. This role was established as a collateral duty to serve as a liaison for victims of Military Sexual Assault Trauma. I had numerous cases, where I served as a liaison on behalf of the victim to the command, the legal teams, investigative services, or whomever. While there have been many things that spark the desire to advocate on behalf of others, this was one of the most humbling experiences of my adult life. To be the strength for the weak, the punching bag for the angry, and the courage for those who have lost comfort within themselves.</p>

<p>What is the most pressing issue for your district (or state)? </p>

<p>In one word opportunity. Jobs, education and Healthcare. If you are employed in Mississippi and you compare your wage to that of other states. You will learn that Mississippians are underpaid. However, many in Mississippi, are underemployed. I want to see Mississippi possess research, development, and technological jobs that stimulate growth. I want the see education attainable at low/ no cost to our citizens who strive for good grades. I want Mississippians to have quality healthcare that is low to no cost for Mississippians. We have an obligation to take care of our people and it is time we start doing so.</p>

<p>If you could propose one piece of legislation that would greatly improve the quality of life for people your district what would it be?</p>

<p>Have you ever heard about Interstate 14 also known as the 14th Amendment Highway? This was a proposed interstate highway that has started in Texas and is working its way across Louisiana and Mississippi.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Jackson City Council meetings are falling into a chaotic pattern—the later it gets into the meeting, the more likely you are to see a show-stopping argument between members of the council. Now it seems the disorganization has potential to put the City's fund balance at risk.</p>

<p>The infighting during May 22's meeting involved both the budget and racial tensions. Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes proposed an item for the council to authorize a grant worth $15,000 to support the annual Farish Street Heritage Festival. Although the City tends to support the festival, it was not included ahead of time as a line item in the budget.</p>

<p>Ward 2 Councilman Melvin Priester Jr. said he did not travel last year because he knew something would come up, and he ended up finding the money for the Farish Street Festival in the city clerk's budget.</p>

<p>At voting time, Stokes had not yet determined where in the budget the money would come from. Alberta Gibson and Lee Davis, who chair the festival pled their case before the council and the mayor to get financial support for the two-day festival.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba, who said he supports Farish Street and the festival, wants to return to a request-for-proposal process instead of having people come to council meetings to persuade the members to find money, especially when he hopes to use some of the City's fund balance, also called the emergency or "rainy day fund," to help out with youth programming in particular. Lumumba encouraged the Farish Street representatives to come to budget hearings this summer so that they can be included more formally next time.</p>

<p>"We do all this politicking at a later hour when were talking about going into an emergency fund. ... [W]e have some very real emergencies," the mayor said.</p>

<p>Ward 7 Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay said that she would offer assistance with fundraising for the festival, but that she was concerned about being fair.</p>

<p>"The question remains is just this: ... it's your festival today and another festival tomorrow, and who decides which festival we choose to fund out of the fund balance?" she said. "It is truly a question of fairness in my mind. That's all."</p>

<p>The council voted 5-2, with Lindsay and Ashby Foote of Ward 1 voting nay. The council had moved on to yet another item—the Jackson Music Awards—that could cost the City $10,000 if the council approves the budget revision Stamps said he will present at the next meeting. Although the council was set to move on to yet another item that ended up drawing $6,000 from the fund balance, Stokes brought the conversation back to Farish Street.</p>

<p>"You've got to look at the City, how people feel when they watch these council meetings," Stokes said. "Two whites vote against Farish Street, and then we say we're working on race relations? Somebody's gonna say it. Imma say it." He was referring to Foote and Lindsay.</p>

<p>"The people are not saying that," Priester chimed back.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are saying that," Stokes said, repeating himself louder.</p>

<p>"You are making it worse by—" Priester began before Stokes interrupted.</p>

<p>Stamps gathered his things and left the council meeting for the night.</p>

<p>"No, I'm telling it like it is," Stokes said. "You go down State Street and see all the work going on in Fondren, but yet you can't support Farish Street?"</p>

<p>Council President Charles Tillman of Ward 5 rapped his gavel down.</p>

<p>"I'm tired of it being this level of discourse," Priester said.</p>

<p>"You can be tired, but it's the truth," Stokes said. "And the truth is going to keep coming out. The white areas are getting better than the black areas in this city, and this is a black-majority city. It ain't right."</p>

<p>"I would just add that the work is going on in your ward," Mayor Lumumba said to Stokes.</p>

<p>There could be serious repercussions if the council continues to spend money in the fund balance, which the City might need to use to repay its debts very soon.</p>

<p>Charles Hatcher, the director of the Department of Finance and Administration, believes that the city council will move the money from the fund balance to go toward Farish Street, although he does not necessarily support it.</p>

<p>"The principle that most disturbed the administration is that you can ask for money without a process," Hatcher told the Jackson Free Press. "All you need to get money from the council is four votes. That doesn't seem like good government."</p>

<p>Hatcher estimates that the City has around $12 million unassigned in the fund balance, and although sums such as $15,000 pail in comparison, there is a bigger picture—and it's a scary one.</p>

<p>"When you look at how much we're going to need to spend, and how much (we're) going to make in the next six years, that fund balance is going to evaporate in the next three years," Hatcher said. "[W]e need a strategy for building it up. It undermines that effort when we pick away at it."</p>

<p>The council also recently approved a raise for the part-time city clerks that drew nearly $117,000 out of the fund balance, causing uproar among City employees.</p>

<p>If the City goes into a negative fund balance, it would be insolvent, and the State of Mississippi could get involved.</p>

<p>Hatcher brings up six years a lot, and it's intentional. Jackson could be "out of the woods" concerning major debt payments to bondholders by 2024. However, in the meantime, Hatcher hopes to drive home the importance of more revenue and guarding the fund balance.</p>

<p>Like the mayor, Hatcher said cutting into the fund balance like the council has been doing, is like having a lot of money in your wallet but a big credit-card bill, so it becomes irresponsible to spend the money in your wallet.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Pelahatchie Mayor Ryshonda Harper Beechem sat at the head of a conference table on May 23 wearing black pants with elegant white ruffles down the side that had fanned as she walked into the room. As her eyes panned reporters around the room, Beechem seemed nervous but firm.</p>

<p>For almost as long as she has been in office, Beechem, 38, has had an investigation looming.</p>

<p>On May 21, State Auditor Stacey Pickering issued demands for current and former town officials, including Beechem, to repay $500,000 because of misspent drug-forfeiture funds dating back to 2015.</p>

<p>"As the mayor, I will take accountability for signing checks because I did sign checks—I had to pay bills," she said. "[A]s the new mayor and, walking into this situation (for) a month and a half, I was under the impression that people abided by the law."</p>

<p>Beechem became Rankin County's first black mayor in July 2017. A couple of months into her tenure, she raised questions about checks that seemed off to her and reached out to the state auditor's office for clarity. The formal state investigation into the town began a month later, she said.</p>

<p>The state auditor says that Pelahatchie officials had been transferring drug-seizure funds to the town's utility account, the fire department and the town's regular checking account to prevent overdraft, and to pay salaries of people outside the police department. Those funds legally can only go toward law-enforcement uses.</p>

<p>"For years, the leadership of Pelahatchie abused these funds by attempting to use them to enhance the overall city budget when they were mandated to be allocated to the Pelahatchie Police Department," State Auditor Stacey Pickering said in a statement provided to the media.</p>

<p>Pickering issued two separate demands with some overlapping parties involved. The first is for $421,688.10 from January 2015 to June 2017 for which the following parties are jointly responsible: former Mayor Knox Ross, Jr.; former Alderman Jerry Norwood; former Alderwoman Megan Hall; former City Clerk Bettye Massey; current Alderman Frank Boyd; current Alderman Michael Adams; and current Alderwoman Margie Warren.</p>

<p>The second demand is for $80,694.97 from July 2017 to December 2017 after Beechem had become mayor. Former City Clerk Massey, Beechem and all five of the town's aldermen are jointly responsible for this second demand.</p>

<p>Beechem does not believe she should have to pay back the funds. Her lawyer, Thomas Bellinger, who sat next to her during the press conference last week, said he will pursue justice for his client.</p>

<p>The board of aldermen has not been open to the media, with all five aldermen either ignoring this reporter's past calls or hanging up at the mention of Beechem.</p>

<p>However, the group released a statement Tuesday entitled "The Mayor Who Cried Wolf," condemning Beechem and resurfacing accusations that she does not live in Pelahatchie, among other statements. Beechem said she dealt with these claims when she ran for mayor and submitted proof of residency. The Pelahatchie aldermen and former Mayor Ross are holding a press conference Wednesday.</p>

<p>The aldermen's statement says their own city auditor told them they could borrow drug-seizure money as long as they repaid it each year. The statement also says that Pickering's office did not interview the aldermen or the former mayor, and that borrowing the drug money is common. "Aldermen want to know why their town is being singled out by Pickering since many small towns across the state use drug seizure money to pay the bills and then repay those funds during the same calendar year," the statement says.</p>

<p>Around 1,300 people live in the small town 25 miles east of Jackson. However, the town drama and tension between the aldermen and mayor have made national news. At their Feb. 5 meeting, the board of aldermen voted to cut Beechem's salary by 75 percent and to halve their own salaries, citing budget cuts. The mayor and the board now make the same, $250 per month. The mayor wrote a veto a week later, laying out her vote of "no confidence" in the board and its financial dealings because of the ongoing state auditor's investigation of Pelahatchie for alleged misappropriation of funds.</p>

<p>The aldermen blame Pickering's investigation for the salary cuts, saying since drug-seizure funds could not be used, "aldermen say they had to find a way to raise the money to pay the bills."</p>

<p>Beechem has also had to step into some clerking duties, as three town clerks resigned in the first three months of 2018. Beechem said two walked out one afternoon in March while Beechem was out of the office. The other one was Massey, who is a named party in the state auditor's investigation and made at least $80,000 working for Pelahatchie.</p>

<p>On average, in cities around the same size as Pelahatchie with part-time mayors, the aldermen tend to make less than the mayor, a Mississippi State University survey shows. Some part-time mayors have salaries as much as 120 times more than Beechem's.</p>

<p>While aldermen earn more than part-time mayors in some towns in the state, they tend to be outliers.</p>

<p>The Pelahatchie Board of Aldermen is not the most transparent, with the board voting to not allow cellphones inside its public meetings earlier this year.</p>

<p>At the January board meeting a month before the salary cuts, Margie Warren recommended that the board should be able to bring up and vote on any items of their choosing, even ones not on the agenda.</p>

<p>The board sided with her unanimously, overriding Beechem's eventual veto. That's how an alderman was able to introduce a pay cut not listed on the agenda. Beechem said in April that the pay cut was "harsh" but not detrimental to her household. Beechem hopes to restore trust among the constituents in her hometown.</p>

<p>"At some point things have to stop, and you have to start doing things the right way. I'm glad that I am in this position because it could've been worse than it is now," the mayor told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<h2 id="lawyerssayjpdofficermayhavekilledtwicedemandsmorenames">Lawyers Say JPD Officer May Have Killed Twice, Demands More Names</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/22/lawyers-say-jpd-officer-may-have-killed-twice-dema/ </p>

<p>Baltimore attorney Jason Downs filed a civil-action petition against the City of Jackson demanding release of the names of officers involved in the shooting death of 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes in January 2018. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Attorneys for the family of Crystalline Barnes, killed by Jackson police on Jan. 27, 2018, are demanding to know the names of officers who shot Jacksonians in incidents over the last several months. They believe the same officer, whom they have identified as Rakasha Adams, may have shot and killed a man on Nov. 15, 2017, as well as Barnes earlier this year.</p>

<p>JPD, to date, has cited its long-time practice of not naming cops who fire on residents. They refuse to reveal names of officers involved in a growing number of officer-involved shootings in Jackson. The Jackson Free Press has not independently confirmed that Adams was involved in either shooting, but has also been denied the names of the officers.</p>

<p>Baltimore-based attorney Jason Downs of Downs Collins P.A. and Mississippi attorney Carlos Moore filed a petition on May 21 against the City of Jackson to retrieve the names of the two Jackson Police Department officers who were involved in the shooting of Crystalline Barnes, 21, in January, so that they can proceed with an excessive-force claim against JPD.</p>

<p>In a petition written on behalf of Crystalline Barnes' 2-year-old son, the attorneys urge the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi to grant a hearing in which someone from JPD would release the names in question.</p>

<p>This comes a week after a press conference outside City Hall where Downs said that his law firm would be taking legal action against the City of Jackson should they not release the names of the officers who allegedly shot and killed Barnes. Following an independent investigation, Downs identified one of the officers in the Barnes shooting as Adams, and his May 21 petition says she was likely also involved in the November death.</p>

<p>'Easily Angered' Officer? </p>

<p>Downs and Moore do not believe Adams received a proper mental evaluation after the November officer-involved shooting in which she allegedly shot an unidentified man in the chest when he brandished a knife.</p>

<p>"Upon information and belief, Jane Doe never received appropriate psychological screening or an adequate fitness for duty evaluation prior to resuming Jane Doe's duties as an officer for the JPD after the November 15 shooting," the court documents read. "Upon information and belief, Jane Doe is Officer Rakasha Adams."</p>

<p>JPD on the scene of officer involved shooting, Mayes St. near Lampton Ave. Unidentified black male subject shot. Officer not injured. No further to release at this time. Investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>— Jackson Police Dept. (@JacksonMSPolice) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>Per JPD protocol, any officer who uses deadly force has to attend stress counseling and a psychiatric/psychological evaluation, the results of which are sent to the police chief before he allows an officer to return to the line of duty. Under Interim Chief of Police Anthony Moore, who replaced Lee Vance early this year, this policy is slightly different. At a city council meeting on Feb. 27, Moore said officers now will not return until after a grand jury reaches a decision—a process that could take at least a year.</p>

<p>The officer also has to debrief with JPD's Employee Assistance Program counselor within 48 hours of the incident so that he or she can confidentially disclose any moral, ethical or psychological after-effects.</p>

<p>At the press conference on May 14, Downs stood by the Barnes family and Crystalline's two young children and told reporters that an independent investigation showed that Officer Adams had admitted in writing to having difficulty concentrating and that she is easily irritated and angered.</p>

<p>"We have an officer that admits to being easily angered walking the streets of Jackson armed with a gun," Downs said. "We believe that these factors play a role in Officer Adams' unjustified decision to shoot at Crystalline.</p>

<p>" Different Accounts of Barnes' Death </p>

<p>The court documents detail a slightly different account of what happened to Barnes than what JPD released in January. Downs and Moore say Officer Adams began following Barnes on Jan. 27 as Barnes drove through Jackson. Adams had apparently been on duty near the intersection of Fernwood Drive and Overstreet Avenue as was a male officer who has not yet been formally identified.</p>

<p>"In contrast to the actions of reasonable police officers, Officer Adams and John Doe exited their vehicles and purportedly attempted to initiate a traffic stop of Ms. Barnes," the court document reads. Both parties agree that Barnes was pulled over in a traffic stop.</p>

<p>However, Downs and Moore allege that Adams and the other male officer fired, collectively, around 18 shots through the side doors and back window of Barnes' car as she drove forward. No gunshots went through the front of her vehicle, but hit the young woman once in the back of the head and once in the back, the attorneys say. Barnes collided head-on and crashed into a pole after being shot.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said in January that the officer who made the stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said in a statement then.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," the statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect's vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Then Holmes said Barnes drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>Minimal Public Information Provided</p>

<p>The petition says Barnes' attorneys filed a public-records request on April 12, 2018, for any and all 911 calls, documents, footage including those from body cameras, police reports, and virtually any media or documentation involving the Barnes death. In return, JPD provided them a one-page incident report without including the name of either officer in the shooting.</p>

<p>Four days later, the attorneys filed another public-records request for the incident report related to the Nov. 15 shooting in which they accuse Adams of being involved. Again, they received a one-page incident report that did not name the officer involved in that shooting.</p>

<p>Barnes and Downs want the names of the officers in order to go through with an excessive force claim that includes "negligent supervision of Jane Doe for JPD's failure to properly provide psychological counseling and fitness for duty evaluations for Jane Doe." The attorneys wrote in the petition that a delay in the release of these names would be a delay in justice.</p>

<p>The Jackson Police Department currently has no policy in place for how it handles the identification of officers who shoot people, just a longstanding practice of never releasing the names or the status of the investigations. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigations stepped in to handle officer-involved shootings in the Jackson metro as of February.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba issued an executive order in March to develop a task force to create city policy on whether or not the City will release officers' names after an officer-involved shooting in Jackson. There have been eight such shootings since Lumumba took office in July 2017 with three lethal ones in 2018 alone.</p>

<p>The task force has met four times over eight weeks and has not reached conclusions to date.</p>

<h2 id="whatlumumbasateamearns">What Lumumba’s ‘A-Team’ Earns</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-23</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/23/what-lumumbas-team-earns/ </p>

<p>Examining the salaries of department heads in the City of Jackson under Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba and former Mayor Tony Yarber shows that Lumumba’s executive staff gets paid between 3.4 and 8 percent more than the previous mayor’s did—but the women don’t fare as well as the men. Photo by File Photo</p>

<p>JACKSON — As we get nearer to annual budget hearings in the City of Jackson, you can almost feel the tension mounting around money issues.</p>

<p>In April, the bickering came over the council's decision to raise the part-time city clerk's salary so that Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote could hire a new clerk. Other municipal workers protested.</p>

<p>During a discussion about the payroll at that same meeting, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, who did not support the pay raise for part-time city clerks, defensively aired out his frustrations with rumors he had heard about how much money people in his administration were making, including one claiming a 30-percent increase in the mayor's staffing budget.</p>

<p>Lumumba said everybody who came to work for him took less money than they were previously making, and that one person on his executive staff took $50,000 less, but he would not name that person.</p>

<p>An analysis of city salaries shows that Mayor Lumumba's "A-Team" makes between 3.4 and 8 percent more than Yarber's did. That group includes the chief administrative officer, the chief of staff, the communications manager, the public-works director, the director of planning and development, and the director of administration.</p>

<p>The variation depends on whether you count the time when Kishia Powell was public-works director from 2014-2016 paid at $150,000 a year compared to when Jerriot Smash took over the role when Powell went to Atlanta. He made $126,000.</p>

<p>Six people in the Lumumba administration are making six figures compared to four under Yarber. Of those, the mayor's salary ($119,999.36) and the chief of police's salary ($112,998.08) are the only positions with wages that are exactly the same across both administrations.</p>

<p>The Cost of the 'A-Team'</p>

<p>Last summer, Lumumba began announcing members of what he labels as his "A-Team." This group, hailing largely from academia, comes at a price, however.</p>

<p>Using data from the National League of Cities' average salaries of municipal officials, an "A-team" not including the mayor or the communications manager, costs around $450,000 collectively. The Lumumba "A-team" minus the communications manager and the mayor himself makes $511,000.</p>

<p>Nearly 2,000 cities and towns belong to the NLC, including 294 in the state.</p>

<p>Public Works Director Bob Miller is the highest-paid person in the City of Jackson with a salary of $125,991.84. However, Powell, Yarber's initial pick for the position, was paid almost 20 percent more than Miller. When Powell went to Atlanta to work for Mayor Kasim Reed, Smash filled in and remained until Miller took over the role in October 2017. Smash made $38 more than Miller makes now.</p>

<p>Robert Blaine, the city's chief administrative officer, is the second-highest paid member of the mayor's "A-team" (not including the mayor) making $111,537.92. His role involves making sure the City is operating efficiently. The various divisions in city government report to Blaine, with the exception of the chief of police, who reports directly to the mayor. Blaine was an unconventional choice for the role considering he has a background in music and working in administration at Jackson State University and Tougaloo College. The CAO under Yarber, originally Gus McCoy, made three-fourths of what Blaine makes.</p>

<p>Then comes Charles Hatcher with the Department of Finance and Administration who makes just over $105,000—an approximately 24-percent increase over the woman in that role under Yarber, Michelle Battee-Day. Hatcher, a Cornell University graduate with bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in consumer economics from the Ivy League School, worked as a professor, then an independent consultant before coming to Jackson.</p>

<p>Mukesh Kumar, the director of planning and development, makes approximately $2,000 more than the last director, with a salary of $86,908.64. Kumar spent nearly 15 years as a professor of urban and regional planning at Jackson State University before joining the Lumumba administration.</p>

<p>Gender Math</p>

<p>The women of the Lumumba "A team" have either seen very little pay increase compared to their predecessors or are being paid less.</p>

<p>Looking at the women's salaries across both administrations, the only women to make six figures in both cabinets have been the city attorneys. Sharon Gipson, Lumumba's city attorney, makes $8 less than Monica Joiner, the city attorney under Yarber, with a salary of $106,238.08.</p>

<p>The mayor's chief of staff, Safiya Omari, makes $81,999.84—just a $2,000 net increase from the last woman in the role, Jacqueline Anderson-Woods.</p>

<p>Omari helps execute and advance the mayor's vision for the City and serves in his place when he is out of town, unavailable, or if a situation can be resolved without him. She also manages constituent services, the business community and communications.</p>

<p>Before coming to work for the City, Omari was the Associate Vice President for Research and Sponsored Programs.</p>

<p>Kai Williams, the city's communication manager, makes $51,617.28 a year which is 15-percent less than the woman in the role under Yarber, Sheila Byrd, who made $59,517.12.</p>

<p>The Pew Research Center found that in 2017, women in the United States working part-time and full-time earned 82 percent of what men earned.</p>

<p>CORRECTION: Safiya Omari's position at the time of departure from JSU was Associate Vice President for Research and Sponsored Programs. The changes are reflected above.</p>

<p>State Librarian Stephen Parks says he fell into his profession by accident. Parks, a La Grange, N.C., native, earned a bachelor's degree in political science from East Carolina University in 2006. Parks moved to Jackson for law school in 2007 and earned his law degree from Mississippi College School of Law in 2010.</p>

<p>"After three years in law school, I realized I didn't want to work as an attorney, but around the time of graduation, I saw they needed someone to work in the law library," he says. "I applied for that position not knowing what it would entail at the time, but I'm glad I took it, because now I love what I'm doing to make law accessible to the public."</p>

<p>In 2013, he received his master's degree in library and information science from the University of Southern Mississippi. He served as the research, instructional services and circulation librarian at MC's School of Law from 2010 to 2015, and taught legal research at the school. Parks also taught law librarianship at Tulane University in summer 2016 and has been an adjunct professor at the University of Southern Mississippi since 2015. He has served as Mississippi's state librarian since January 2016 and is responsible for overseeing the State Law Library inside the Gartin Justice Building in downtown Jackson. The library provides legal research materials for the judiciary branch, state agencies, lawyers, students and the general public.</p>

<p>"Since becoming state librarian I've been working hard to raise public awareness of the library, because many people don't realize it's available to the public," Parks says. "I want everyone to know they can visit us and use our resources."</p>

<p>In 2016 he established a partnership with the Mississippi Digital Library to provide some of the law library's historical items such as House and Senate journals online.</p>

<p>The American Association of Law Libraries, a national association of law school and court libraries, and independent librarians who perform law research, recently named Parks as a recipient of its 2018 Emerging Leader Award.</p>

<p>AALL gives the award to law librarians with less than 10 years of organization membership who have made significant contributions to the associations.</p>

<p>Parks, 33, is also chairman of the Central Mississippi Library Council, and previously served as vice president and Scholarship Committee chair of the organization. He is a member of the Mississippi Bar, the American Association of Law Libraries and the Southeastern Chapter of AALL.</p>

<p>Around 5 p.m. on May 17, most of the trucks had already lined up for Dinner and a Movie: A Food Truck Festival. Most Third Thursday events tend to be pretty quiet around the start time, but people had already started wandering for that festival.</p>

<p>About 17 food trucks showed up for the event, including LurnyD's Grille, 2 for 7 Kitchen, Chunky Dunks Sweets Truck and BessiRoo's, so people had a variety of food to choose from, not to mention other vendors that sold popcorn and painted faces.</p>

<p>Even with the forecast of rain, people showed up and piled on the lawn of the Art Garden, lying on blankets and sitting on chairs while listening to Pam Confer perform. Kids played in the fountains and made art with sidewalk chalk in the outdoor Art Lab. Around 8 p.m., Pixar classic "Wall-E" began playing. Of course, it was within the first five minutes that the rain rolled in. But rain aside, it was a good event.</p>

<p>Then, on Saturday, May 22, vendors started rolling into midtown around 2 p.m. to get ready for Midfest. In the 90-plus-degree heat, we popped up tents and unfolded tables. We hung art and placed our wares on tables.</p>

<p>Around 3 p.m., people began slowly trickling in. By the time the Southern Komfort Brass Band began their march, Wesley Avenue had a decent crowd. When the event ended, Offbeat had an after-party that I considered attending but decided not to because I was tired, sweaty and dirty.</p>

<p>As you can see, while it's easy to say that there's nothing to do in Jackson, that's not true. That was three events in four days, and I know from looking at jfpevents.com that there were plenty more in Jackson and the surrounding counties.</p>

<p>A lot of people tend to want to put Jackson in a negative light.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to do here," multiple people have said to me.</p>

<p>Sure, if you come from a bigger city, there may be less to do here, but you have many options, even if it's just going to the Mississippi Farmers Market on a Saturday morning.</p>

<p>It's so easy to be negative, especially about Jackson. The city isn't perfect. Miscommunications and infrastructure problems resulted in the death of Frances Anne Fortner, a student who was getting ready to graduate from Jackson Academy and attend journalism school. A cycle of violence resulted in the death of rising hip-hop star Lil Lonnie. We also have to deal with water problems, urban blight, under-funded education, and the list goes on.</p>

<p>I'm a bit of a hoarder when it comes to T-shirts. I have a drawer full of them, and then a second full of ones I wear when I paint. My two favorite T-shirts are from Studio Chane. One is the City of Jackson seal with some of the neighborhoods written on it. The other one is the City's seal with "City of Potholes" in the surrounding circles. They allow me to poke fun at Jackson while also repping it—in a good way.</p>

<p>That's the same reason I love my small collection of CityPins. Those items are fun and funny and insightful. They tell the story of Jackson—both the good and the bad.</p>

<p>We need real solutions to all of our problems. We need to talk about what the City should look like, about what do about the cycle of violence and crumbling infrastructure and the outside perception of Jackson.</p>

<p>Yes, actions speak louder than words, but sometimes it's important to talk and plan, then do. Not the other way around. You probably get mad when someone keys your car and then talks to you about the problem, instead of talking first and maybe even avoiding keying altogether.</p>

<p>At my church, we talk a lot about the importance of community, how we shouldn't have to be alone when we're dealing with problems, even if we feel alone. Humans are meant to be in community with each other. That's why there are cases where people have problems socially and developmentally when they don't have social interaction. That's why we're born into families and gather circles of friends. That's why kids who don't make positive friends have such a hard time with life.</p>

<p>We need that sense of community, and we need that dialogue. We need to come across all lines—racial, economic, religious, etc.—and find a good solution to what ails us. One person doesn't have to shoulder the world or even Jackson. None of us are Atlas, and I bet you anything that he got tired of carrying that burden sometimes.</p>

<p>Does a T-shirt with "Jackson get your sh*t together" shed a positive light on Jackson, or create productive dialogue ? Does it help uplift the city's narrative? Does DIY pothole patching create a long-term solution? Nope. Sure, it's a quick solution to a problem, and it's meant to be a quick solution. We get that. But at this point, we don't need quick solutions.</p>

<p>We need more than just a T-shirt with a cuss word and temporary patches, and the resulting divisiveness.</p>

<p>And that outside perception? Guess what? We can't change people's minds ourselves. We can't force people in Madison and Rankin counties to believe that Jackson isn't a bad place (even though we all know it's true). We have to show them what it has to offer, and then they can decide what to believe.</p>

<p>My sister and I have had semi-regular lunch meetings lately, and I always insist that we eat in Jackson. It's partially because I want to stay close to work and spend optimal time with her, but it's also because she hasn't really seen the city.</p>

<p>She lives in Rankin County, and like a lot of people, she bought into this lie that Jackson is a bad place. But slowly, I think she's starting to see it for what it is: an incredible city (with some deep-rooted issues, to be sure) that has a lot to offer. Now we just need to believe that ourselves.</p>

<p>It is officially music festival season. If you find yourself going to one this year, you'll want to be prepared. Here are some tips to survive the event and have fun.</p>

<p>Look at the festival rules. It is important to know what you can and cannot take into a venue, and the more you know, the quicker you'll get through the lines.</p>

<p>Get a ticket beforehand. You may be able to buy tickets on site, but they typically will sell out quickly.</p>

<p>Get a bag that can carry everything. And I mean everything and extras, like T-shirts or freebies. You won't want to carry a water bottle or your phone around the entire time.</p>

<p>If you have prescription or expensive glasses or sunglasses, put them in a case when you take them off. They're less likely to get damaged and harder to lose.</p>

<p>Find a good sunscreen, and reapply it every few hours. Even if it is a cloudy day, UV rays can still damage your skin. Also, make sure to bring BAND-AIDs—accidents happen, especially in crowds.</p>

<p>Get a portable battery pack for your phone. This will come in handy when you've been at a festival for the better part of a day, and your phone is dying while your favorite band plays. Some festivals may also have charging stations, so keep an eye out for those.</p>

<p>Don't eat a lot before the festival. Trust me. You will regret it. Sweaty and stuffed are not a fun combination.</p>

<p>Conserve your energy beforehand. You may be at the festival for seven-plus hours, so you want to be as rested as possible by the time you get to the event.</p>

<p>Bring snacks, such as protein bars or small packets of peanut butter. If the venue allows outside food, this can save you quite a few dollars. More money for merch!</p>

<p>Bring a poncho. Almost every music festival gets rained on at some point, so you want to be prepared. And it can double as something to lay on the ground.</p>

<p>Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Sure, it's nice to look cute, but you should probably also wear something that you don't mind getting dirty. Take a look at the weather forecast, too, as rain boots may be a good idea.</p>

<h2 id="opiniontheholylandisraeliorpalestinian">OPINION: The Holy Land, Israeli or Palestinian?</h2>

<p>I've come to the conclusion that the Palestinians have been given a raw deal and are being treated unfairly by Israel, by the American media and particularly now by the White House. Photo by Max Pixel</p>

<p>Avery Rollins</p>

<p>In 1966 I was one of four FBI Agents assigned to a yearlong Arabic language/Iraqi dialect course at the Army Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif. In that 12-month course, I was introduced to Muslim history, culture and politics, and made many Muslim friends, including Iraqis, Egyptians, Kurds and Palestinians.</p>

<p>When the six-day Arab/Israeli war broke out in June 1967, our formal instruction ceased, and we spent the week listening to radio broadcasts from the BBC, Radio Cairo and Radio Tel Aviv. We also heard many personal stories from Palestinians about the "Nakba," the catastrophe which occurred in 1948 when the establishment of the State of Israel resulted in the expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes and villages, making them refugees.</p>

<p>In the subsequent 30 years of my FBI career, I worked Middle East espionage and terrorism cases in New York City, Washington, D. C., and Oxford, Miss. I visited Israel, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and Gaza. Since that time I've come to the conclusion that the Palestinians have been given a raw deal and are being treated unfairly by Israel, by the American media and particularly now by the White House.</p>

<p>With the land seizures in 1948, and the seizure of Gaza and the West Bank in 1967, Israel gained control over a Palestinian population that is now approaching five million. Palestinians have little political or monetary control over their lives and chaff under illegal Israeli rule.</p>

<p>Another 1.5 million of them live in refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that in the current Israeli/Palestinian conflict, most American media favor the State of Israel over the aspirations of Palestinians who wish to establish their own country. The truth is Palestinians have an even greater right to The Holy Land than do the Israelis. The British Mandate governed Palestine from 1922 to 1948. During that time the resident population was about 700,000: 80 percent Palestinian; 10 percent Jew; 10 percent Christian. The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 resulted in a huge influx of Jewish refugees and illegal land grabs from Palestinians, which continue today in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Orthodox Israelis and others claim the Holy Land is theirs based on biblical history and tradition. DNA studies show that Israelis and Palestinians spring from the same Canaanite ancestors. More than likely, Canaanite tribes in the Holy Land split into two separate groups: Jews and Palestinians.</p>

<p>The truth is that the most famous stories in the Old Testament Bible, like the Exodus and King David, are a collection of oral histories and myths rather than actual historical facts.</p>

<p>These are wonderful allegories that I enjoy reading. But they should not be used as a basis to illegally seize property, land and freedom from the Palestinians.</p>

<p>What I am suggesting is that those who rely on the Bible as justifying the State of Israel are relying on myths and stories that have no historical, legal or archeological basis. It is time to give the Palestinians back their country; return Israel to the original 1947 UN Partition Plan of Palestine; and allow Palestinians to return to their homeland.</p>

<h2 id="editorialcitymustbecomeproactivenotreactivetoproblems">EDITORIAL: City Must Become Proactive, Not Reactive to Problems</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Editorial Board</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-23</p>

<p>If Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba is to be a radical changemaker, he and those under him must be proactive so that, at the very least, no one else dies while traversing the streets in Mississippi's capital city due to negligence. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Now that a promising young woman has died because of a massive systems failure in the City, allow us to repeat ourselves: This administration cannot afford to be reactionary to the mounting issues in the City. If Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba is to be a radical changemaker, he and those under him must be proactive so that, at the very least, no one else dies while traversing the streets in Mississippi's capital city due to negligence.</p>

<p>Before Frances Fortner, 18, died due to an ignored manhole, Jacksonian Jean Holmes reported the loose manhole cover to a police officer after she had two flat tires earlier that day. An officer deemed the manhole fine, and the City did not care enough to secure the deadly site.</p>

<p>Superior Asphalt, a contractor, is continuing its work after raising the manhole covers at the site of Fortner's fatal accident two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Whether due to low morale in public works or the administration in general, a bad contracting job or overwhelm in the police department, there is no excuse for Fortner's death. We appreciate that Lumumba admitted publicly that no one in the City took the hazard seriously enough to urgently check and repair it. But owning this tragic catastrophe is the least he and his well-paid chief administrative officer could do. What is required is a total systems check and overhaul with transparency, accountability and staff management and motivation instilled at every City position; staffers who don't get on board must be replaced.</p>

<p>This is difficult, but it is what every effective organization must do—especially those taxpayers fund. And it is what both Lumumba and CAO Robert Blaine must require and do. Far too many things happen last minute or too late on their watch—from midnight press alerts of meetings 12 hours later to Friday-night tax increases.</p>

<p>We do not yet see the urgency this tragedy should ignite in the Lumumba administration to immediately institute smart, strict systems that could have kept Fortner alive. At a May 21 press conference, after the mayor said he and Public Works Director Bob Miller are working to come up with better protocols, Lumumba suggested that citizens call both 911 and 311 when they encounter dangerous potholes or uncovered manholes.</p>

<p>There must be a better solution than calling 911 for someone to bring out an orange cone, especially after 40 homicides this year alone—or than calling two places hoping one might respond. The public needs to see a sense of immediacy about who is responsible for taking the call, assigning an immediate response, tracking it, checking it and alerting the public. We want printed policies and checklists showing who is accountable at every stage, which every City department needs to develop for every responsibility we pay its workers to do. Lumumba and Blaine must instill systems today.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi county election commissions will be able to apply to the secretary of state's office for federal grant funds to secure elections this year. Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann announced that Mississippi will receive $4.5 million in federal Help America Vote Act funds, likely this summer. Hosemann put up a 5-percent match, about $224,000, from his state budget so the state can receive the funding.</p>

<p>He told the Jackson Free Press that some of the funds will go toward making the Statewide Election Management System stronger, but the majority of the money will go to the counties that apply. They can use the funds to upgrade voting machines, or if they do not need those upgrades—like in Hinds County—they can apply for funds to use on election security and disability access.</p>

<p>"We're encouraging them to make sure we have disability access to the polls," Hosemann said.</p>

<p>Counties will not receive the funds before the congressional primary election on June 5 but could have them before the general election in November.</p>

<p>Hosemann's office has worked with the Mississippi National Guard and the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that the state's election system is secure. Mississippi's voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and some counties use paper ballots. In order to test security, Hosemann has hired outside groups to attempt to penetrate the statewide election system, but no such attempts have prevailed, he said.</p>

<p>"The cyber-security risk is not that they will get your ballot; it's that they will influence your decision," Hosemann told the Jackson Free Press. "If you look at these companies that have been charged by the president for participating in our election process, they're all doing it by Facebook and email, and those kinds of things."</p>

<p>He pointed to social-media accounts Russian groups used to influence public opinion during the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>"One of the (usernames) was 'Tenn_gop.' Now, you and I would think, 'Well, that's the Tennessee GOP.' Well, it's not; it's the Russians," Hosemann said. "They tried to get us to where we are so distrustful of the system that we don't cast a ballot. That's the biggest risk."</p>

<p>Mississippians will go to the polls on June 5 to vote in Democratic or Republican primary elections, which are open. All four Congressional House seats are up for re-election, as well as both Senate seats after Sen. Thad Cochran retired this spring.</p>

Photo by Marie Weidmayer</p>

<p>JACKSON — At a press conference on Tuesday, May 22, Mayor Chowke Antar Lumumba announced programs to try to help decrease youth crime, including summer programs and new policing methods.</p>

<p>"We truly are excited about engaging our youth," Lumumba said. "Let me be clear that we do not believe nor are we saying that our issues of crime are ... (only) on account of young people. But we have seen a recent spree of instances that have been engaged by a particularly young demographic, and we have failed in some regard as adults if our young people are not directing positivity, so we're going to make the decision that we're not going to allow them to be on that path anymore."</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department officers will receive training in community policing, but Lumumba declined to name the group that will train them, saying the City will release the information at a later date.</p>

<p>"How we direct this training will take advantage of lessons learned around the country and the nation, but it will be specifically tailored to the unique culture of Jackson," the mayor said.</p>

<p>Officers will also receive violence interruption training. The City will also start credible messenger training, which prepares former criminals to help young people stay out of legal troubles, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>"This is the type of training that utilizes the experiences of individuals that have found themselves on the wrong side of the law, who have found themselves historically having gone down a path that is less desirable but yet still have the ear of our young people," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>For more information, call the Department of Parks and Recreation at 601-960-0471.</p>

<p>Youth Programs</p>

<p>Lumumba also said he will request that the City Council use extra money in the budget to fund youth programs.</p>

<p>"Instead of spending as much time telling young people what not to do, we need to make certain that we are giving our efforts towards telling them what to do," he said.</p>

<p>A summer employment program will aim to teach people ages 16 to 24 work ethic and skills. Part of the program includes a partnership with Apple to teach participants application coding through a curriculum called Swift Playgrounds.</p>

<p>"This is a gamified learning curriculum where students will actually learn how to code for app development," Robert Blaine, Jackson's chief administrative officer, said at the press conference.</p>

<p>Youth will work with corporate partners to develop small apps for the companies, he said.</p>

<p>"We've taken a lot of applicants already for the summer employment program, so that's basically going to take a few more for the coding part. For the most part, those applications have already been taken," Director of Human and Cultural Services Adriane Dorsey-Kidd told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>However, she said that if there is a lot of interest in the program, it could expand.</p>

<p>Those interested in applying should call 601-960-0335 and ask for Family and Youth Coordinator Eva Howard.</p>

<p>Registration for the summer program for children ages 6 to 12 ends Friday. To register, visit the Department of Parks and Recreation at the Metrocenter Mall, and bring the child's birth certificate or shot record and a money order for $110.</p>

<p>There is also an early childhood program for children ages 5 and under. Parents can register their kids for the year-round program by calling Manager Jewell Reed at 601-960-0035. The program has a sliding fee scale so families pay anywhere from $10 a week to $10 a month based on need.</p>

<p>"I would also like to solicit the support of any philanthropic donors, any of our corporations, any of our partners in this city, that they be willing to give donations toward youth programs," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>Swimming Pools</p>

<p>At the press conference, Parks and Recreation Director Ison B. Harris Jr. said that the City will open five pools on Memorial Day, with an additional pool in Presidential Hills to open the week after the holiday.</p>

<p>The pools are Grove Park Pool, McDowell Pool, VA/Legion Pool, Vine Street Pool and Russell C. Davis Pool, also known as Mary C. Jones Pool. In August, two splash pads will break ground in the city.</p>

<p>"We're excited about those opportunities," Harris said. "We're really excited about what's going on in Parks and Rec. We're really excited about what's going on in the city, and we're looking to engage our young people through their challenging times this summer."</p>

<p>Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman apologized on Thursday to anyone who may have felt "uncomfortable or disrespected" by his behavior, after CNN reported that multiple women have accused the A-list actor of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior on movie sets and in other professional settings.</p>

<p>"Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy," the actor, now 80, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press by his publicist, Stan Rosenfield. "I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected — that was never my intent."</p>

<p>Freeman won the 2005 Oscar for best supporting actor for "Million Dollar Baby." He was nominated four other times, including for "Driving Miss Daisy" and "The Shawshank Redemption," and is renowned for his prolific voiceover work.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, he was honored by SAG-AFTRA with a lifetime achievement award. In a statement to The Associated Press, the organization, which represents actors, journalists and others, called the allegations "compelling and devastating" and contrary to its attempts to make sure working environments are safe in the industry.</p>

<p>"Any accused person has the right to due process, but it is our starting point to believe the courageous voices who come forward to report incidents of harassment," the statement read. "Given Mr. Freeman recently received one of our union's most prestigious honors recognizing his body of work, we are therefore reviewing what corrective actions may be warranted at this time."</p>

<p>The CNN report includes the account of a production assistant on the 2017 heist film "Going In Style," who detailed an incident in which the actor repeatedly tried to lift up her skirt, and asked if she was wearing underwear. She alleged that Freeman subjected her to unwanted touching and comments on a near-daily basis on the film.</p>

<p>Several women alleged that he made frequent comments about their bodies, or would stare at them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. CNN spoke to 16 people about Freeman; eight said they had experienced harassment or inappropriate behavior, and eight said they had witnessed such conduct. Seven of them described harassment or inappropriate behavior at Revelations Entertainment, a company he co-founded with Lori McCreary.</p>

<p>The CNN report also cited accounts by three entertainment reporters of inappropriate remarks they allege Freeman made at press junkets, including the report's co-author, Chloe Melas, who describes Freeman shaking her hand, "not letting go while repeatedly looking her up and down and saying more than once a variation of, 'I wish I was there'" — and also "You are ripe."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — An effort to turn the home of a slain civil rights leader into a national monument is gaining more bipartisan support.</p>

<p>Republican U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama introduced a bill Monday to make the Medgar Evers home a monument.</p>

<p>The U.S. House passed a bill last week to do the same thing. The two chambers must agree on a single bill before it could go to the president.</p>

<p>As Mississippi's first NAACP field secretary beginning in 1954, Evers organized protests and boycotts to fight segregation. He was assassinated by a white supremacist outside his family's Jackson home in 1963.</p>

<p>Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has recommended national monument status for the Evers home, which is now owned by Tougaloo College.</p>

<h2 id="lawyerssayjpdofficermayhavekilledtwicedemandsmorenames-1">Lawyers Say JPD Officer May Have Killed Twice, Demands More Names</h2>

<p>Baltimore attorney Jason Downs filed a civil-action petition against the City of Jackson demanding release of the names of officers involved in the shooting death of 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes in January 2018. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Attorneys for the family of Crystalline Barnes, killed by Jackson police on Jan. 27, 2018, are demanding to know the names of officers who shot Jacksonians in incidents over the last several months. They believe the same officer, whom they have identified as Rakasha Adams, may have shot and killed a man on Nov. 15, 2017, as well as Barnes earlier this year.</p>

<p>JPD, to date, has cited its long-time practice of not naming cops who fire on residents. They refuse to reveal names of officers involved in a growing number of officer-involved shootings in Jackson. The Jackson Free Press has not independently confirmed that Adams was involved in either shooting, but has also been denied the names of the officers.</p>

<p>Baltimore-based attorney Jason Downs of Downs Collins P.A. and Mississippi attorney Carlos Moore filed a petition on May 21 against the City of Jackson to retrieve the names of the two Jackson Police Department officers who were involved in the shooting of Crystalline Barnes, 21, in January, so that they can proceed with an excessive-force claim against JPD.</p>

<p>In a petition written on behalf of Crystalline Barnes' 2-year-old son, the attorneys urge the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi to grant a hearing in which someone from JPD would release the names in question.</p>

<p>This comes a week after a press conference outside City Hall where Downs said that his law firm would be taking legal action against the City of Jackson should they not release the names of the officers who allegedly shot and killed Barnes. Following an independent investigation, Downs identified one of the officers in the Barnes shooting as Adams, and his May 21 petition says she was likely also involved in the November death.</p>

<p>'Easily Angered' Officer? </p>

<p>Downs and Moore do not believe Adams received a proper mental evaluation after the November officer-involved shooting in which she allegedly shot an unidentified man in the chest when he brandished a knife.</p>

<p>"Upon information and belief, Jane Doe never received appropriate psychological screening or an adequate fitness for duty evaluation prior to resuming Jane Doe's duties as an officer for the JPD after the November 15 shooting," the court documents read. "Upon information and belief, Jane Doe is Officer Rakasha Adams."</p>

<p>JPD on the scene of officer involved shooting, Mayes St. near Lampton Ave. Unidentified black male subject shot. Officer not injured. No further to release at this time. Investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>— Jackson Police Dept. (@JacksonMSPolice) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>Per JPD protocol, any officer who uses deadly force has to attend stress counseling and a psychiatric/psychological evaluation, the results of which are sent to the police chief before he allows an officer to return to the line of duty. Under Interim Chief of Police Anthony Moore, who replaced Lee Vance early this year, this policy is slightly different. At a city council meeting on Feb. 27, Moore said officers now will not return until after a grand jury reaches a decision—a process that could take at least a year.</p>

<p>The officer also has to debrief with JPD's Employee Assistance Program counselor within 48 hours of the incident so that he or she can confidentially disclose any moral, ethical or psychological after-effects.</p>

<p>At the press conference on May 14, Downs stood by the Barnes family and Crystalline's two young children and told reporters that an independent investigation showed that Officer Adams had admitted in writing to having difficulty concentrating and that she is easily irritated and angered.</p>

<p>"We have an officer that admits to being easily angered walking the streets of Jackson armed with a gun," Downs said. "We believe that these factors play a role in Officer Adams' unjustified decision to shoot at Crystalline.</p>

<p>" Different Accounts of Barnes' Death </p>

<p>The court documents detail a slightly different account of what happened to Barnes than what JPD released in January. Downs and Moore say Officer Adams began following Barnes on Jan. 27 as Barnes drove through Jackson. Adams had apparently been on duty near the intersection of Fernwood Drive and Overstreet Avenue as was a male officer who has not yet been formally identified.</p>

<p>"In contrast to the actions of reasonable police officers, Officer Adams and John Doe exited their vehicles and purportedly attempted to initiate a traffic stop of Ms. Barnes," the court document reads. Both parties agree that Barnes was pulled over in a traffic stop.</p>

<p>However, Downs and Moore allege that Adams and the other male officer fired, collectively, around 18 shots through the side doors and back window of Barnes' car as she drove forward. No gunshots went through the front of her vehicle, but hit the young woman once in the back of the head and once in the back, the attorneys say. Barnes collided head-on and crashed into a pole after being shot.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said in January that the officer who made the stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said in a statement then.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," the statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect's vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Then Holmes said Barnes drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>Minimal Public Information Provided</p>

<p>The petition says Barnes' attorneys filed a public-records request on April 12, 2018, for any and all 911 calls, documents, footage including those from body cameras, police reports, and virtually any media or documentation involving the Barnes death. In return, JPD provided them a one-page incident report without including the name of either officer in the shooting.</p>

<p>Four days later, the attorneys filed another public-records request for the incident report related to the Nov. 15 shooting in which they accuse Adams of being involved. Again, they received a one-page incident report that did not name the officer involved in that shooting.</p>

<p>Barnes and Downs want the names of the officers in order to go through with an excessive force claim that includes "negligent supervision of Jane Doe for JPD's failure to properly provide psychological counseling and fitness for duty evaluations for Jane Doe." The attorneys wrote in the petition that a delay in the release of these names would be a delay in justice.</p>

<p>The Jackson Police Department currently has no policy in place for how it handles the identification of officers who shoot people, just a longstanding practice of never releasing the names or the status of the investigations. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigations stepped in to handle officer-involved shootings in the Jackson metro as of February.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba issued an executive order in March to develop a task force to create city policy on whether or not the City will release officers' names after an officer-involved shooting in Jackson. There have been eight such shootings since Lumumba took office in July 2017 with three lethal ones in 2018 alone.</p>

<p>The task force has met four times over eight weeks and has not reached conclusions to date.</p>

<h2 id="lumumbacitesfailuresthatledtodeathoffrancesfortner">Lumumba Cites 'Failures' That Led to Death of Frances Fortner</h2>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba held a press conference on May 21, where he acknowledged the City of Jackson failed to respond appropriately to a road hazard which caused a fatal crash on May 17. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>On behalf of the City of Jackson, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has accepted responsibility for not preventing the accident that killed Frances "Franny" Fortner.</p>

<p>"I feel that it is my responsibility as mayor of this city to be honest to the Fortner family and to be honest to the citizens of Jackson and acknowledge that the City of Jackson failed to appropriately secure the site at the time that we learned that the manhole cover was not properly in place," Lumumba said at a press briefing Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>"We owe responsibility to the Fortner family, and we owe that acknowledgement and taking responsibility to the citizens of Jackson. I offer my sincerest condolences."</p>

<p>The investigation into the crash that killed a recent Jackson Academy graduate is ongoing, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>The crash occurred around noon on May 17 on Ridgewood Road near Venetian Way, when Fortner hit a manhole and her vehicle flipped as she drove to graduation practice in her mother's convertible.</p>

<p>Prior to Fortner's crash, Jackson resident Jean Holmes reported a loose manhole cover to a Jackson police officer after she had two flat tires around 9 a.m. The City of Jackson did not secure the crash site appropriately after the report of flat tires, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>Construction on Ridgewood Road has been ongoing since June 2017. Superior Asphalt paved the interior lanes in June and July. The company then left the jobsite and returned to pave the exterior lanes in October and November. In February, Superior Asphalt paved the intersections, Director of Public Works Bob Miller said at the press conference.</p>

<p>Then two weeks ago, Superior Asphalt returned to raise the manhole covers to road level and finish miscellaneous tasks, Miller said.</p>

<p>"We would have much preferred for those manholes to be raised at the time of the paving or shortly thereafter, and there is some dissatisfaction on our part that it took as long as it did. But we do not believe that there were open manholes with no barricades around it until the day of the tragic accident," Miller said.</p>

<p>Manhole covers weigh between 100 and 150 pounds and are not secured because of their weight, the mayor said Monday, with Superior spokesman Kenny Bush confirming that by phone. Superior Asphalt places the covers and then adds pavement around the covers to ensure the surface is level, Bush said.</p>

<p>"It was covered Friday, a week before the accident," Bush said. "We were finished with that manhole and those around it on that particular part of Ridgewood the week before. They had been driven over for five or six days with no issues."</p>

<p>It is believed the manhole cover failed in the fatal crash, but more details will not be available until the investigations are complete, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>"What we have here are two failures," Lumumba said. "We have—and there is still an investigation into one of those failures, well, there is an investigation for all of them—one failure infrastructure. All we know now is Superior is the contractor who was dealing with the project."</p>

<p>Lumumba said he reviewed the calls the City received about the manhole on May 17. The City received calls about the manhole cover after Holmes' incident around 9 a.m. and after the fatal crash.</p>

<p>"But let me be clear the citizens did what they were supposed to do in the circumstance," Lumumba said. "There's evidence that the citizens called as they should have called."</p>

<p>After Holmes popped two tires, a police officer responded to secure the car and check the manhole cover. The officer conducted a visual inspection of the cover and believed it to be in place, but officers do not have infrastructure training, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>"People were dispatched but we—even in people being dispatched—we did not appropriately secure the site," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>The Department of Public Works does not do first response for incidents, which means no one from the department was dispatched immediately to the site. The city is looking into how it responds to reports of road hazards to establish better protocols, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>For now, Lumumba advised citizens to call both 911 and 311 to report road hazards, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>It is hard to choose which site of civil-rights trauma in Mississippi should be a national park, but the effort is under way and controversial, even among some family members who lost loved ones due to white-supremacist violence.</p>

<p>Last week, a group from the National Parks Service traversed the state to host listening sessions to determine where a new national park with civil-rights significance would go. Last May, Congress passed a law requiring the U.S. secretary of the interior to study at least five locales in Mississippi significant to the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

<p>Congress included the Medgar and Myrlie Evers House in Jackson where Medgar was assassinated in 1963; Bryant's Grocery &amp; Meat Market where 14-year-old Emmett Till allegedly whistled at Carolyn Bryant in 1955—a fabricated act for which he was later murdered; the Tallahatchie County Courthouse where the men accused of murdering Till were tried and acquitted; the Old Neshoba County Jail where three Freedom Summer civil rights workers James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were kept before police and the Ku Klux Klan murdered them in June 1964; and Dr. Gilbert Mason's former medical office in Biloxi on the Coast, where he helped organize "wade-ins" from 1959-1963 to desegregate the beaches.</p>

<p>But not everyone liked the suggestions. Impassioned community members showed up at the public forums, some advocating for other sites to be included and others lamenting the initial five sites.</p>

<p>Till Family 'Not Pleased'</p>

<p>Priscilla Sterling, a relative of Till, was one of them. She stood up in front of approximately three dozen people in a "Emmett Till Family for Justice" T-shirt at the Medgar Evers library in Jackson on May 8 to discourage the NPS representatives from considering the Bryant Store and the Tallahatchie Courthouse. She had also gone to the listening session at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum that morning.</p>

<p>"As a family member of Emmett Till, the sites that you all suggested you know we did not like," Sterling said. "The perpetrators owned the store, and (Carolyn Bryant) lied, and that just shouldn't be a national landmark. The courthouse is out because (Till) never received justice; these men were able to get off and go out and sell the story. So the family is not pleased with these two locations."</p>

<p>Instead, Sterling asked NPS representatives to add the home of Moses Wright, Till's great uncle, where the boy stayed during his brief time in the state and where the white men kidnapped him.</p>

<p>"We never received justice, the State of Mississippi never apologized to the family, so we do not see the courthouse or the grocery story as a national landmark—they should not use it, period," she said.</p>

<p>Sterling does not believe that Till has been honored adequately. She pointed to rising hate in the nation during the same time period when Carolyn Bryant's confession to lying about her interaction with Till in 1955 surfaced in Timothy Tyson's 2017 book "The Blood of Emmett Till." In the book, she tells Tyson that her trial testimony that Till had grabbed her around the waist and uttered obscenities was not true. Sterling believes true justice would mean bringing Bryant to trial. For now, she said it was good the parks people seemed open to considering other places.</p>

<p>Alferdteen Harrison, a retired Jackson State University professor and chairwoman of Scott Ford Houses Inc., also has concerns about this National Parks study. She leads an effort to restore the two houses that once belonged to a midwife and her daughter in the Farish Street Historic District as timepieces demonstrating African American life between slavery and the Civil Rights Movement. If she secures the funding, she hopes to turn the homes into interpretive museums that highlight how African Americans lived after slavery.</p>

<p>"Is it all about people getting killed or people stepping out ... or is it how did people live from this period from the end of slavery to the Civil Rights Movement?" she asked the NPS parks representatives when they opened the floor up for a question and answer session. "My basic concern is ... what about how African Americans lived in this interim, what we called the stepping stone. How do you get to the Civil Rights Movement?"</p>

<p>To meet the criteria of a feasible National Parks site, an area has to contain nationally significant or cultural resources, represent a cultural resource that is not yet represented in an existing national park, present a need for NPS management, and the parks service has to be able to acquire and maintain the property for a reasonable cost. If a site meets all of the criteria, Congress would decide to enact legislation to establish a new park or the president himself would make that call.</p>

<p>'Mississippi Burning'</p>

<p>At the meeting in Philadelphia, Miss., about 70 miles to the east of Jackson, Ben West of the NPS told the crowd of about 45 on May 9 that he was not quite sure how Congress chose the sites they listed in the 2017 legislation mandating the study.</p>

<p>"We've gotten a lot of questions and concerns about how those sites were presented to us, and honestly, my answer is that those are the first five that we started with, but we've certainly heard of a lot more over the last several days to understand the ones that perhaps weren't in that list," West said.</p>

<p>He assured the room that those five sites were not chiseled in stone and that they had come to Philadelphia to learn more about the deep history there.</p>

<p>Philadelphia is notorious for what the FBI dubbed the "Mississippi Burning" murders in 1964. As part of the Freedom Summer efforts to help black Mississippians register to vote, Mt. Zion United Methodist Church in the black community of Longdale had been identified as a site for those efforts. One evening in June 1964, the Ku Klux Klan met church members leaving Mt. Zion, beat members and burned the church to the ground.</p>

<p>On June 21, 1964, the three civil rights workers, Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner, went down that woodsy, winding road leading to the church to investigate the burning. On their way back to the COFO offices in Meridian, Neshoba County Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price pulled them over for speeding and took them to what is now the Old Neshoba County Jail—a site Congress listed to be included in the civil rights study.</p>

<p>The three men were released that evening. With a lynch mob in tow, Price followed the men as they rolled down the dark Highway 19 South. Price stopped them, and he and at least a half-dozen other white men shot them on a dirt road off Highway 19 and then transported them to be buried under an earthen dam on the western side of the county. Their bodies were not found for 44 days. Several of the men, including Price, were prosecuted in federal court for violating the three men's civil rights and served several years in prison, but the State of Mississippi would not bring charges then.</p>

<p>Decades later, in 2005, the State of Mississippi tried and convicted mob organizer Edgar Ray Killen of manslaughter for orchestrating the murders.</p>

<p>Jewel McDonald, a member of Mt. Zion who meets tourists who come to the church from all over the world, said most people want to just spend time on the grounds, walk through the cemetery where black civil-rights heroes are buried or pray on what some refer to as holy ground.</p>

<p>McDonald's mother and brother were beaten at the church the night the Klan burned it in 1964.</p>

<p>Jackie (Steele) Spencer was 8 years old and at the church when the Klan came.</p>

<p>"I remember a little bit," she said. "... My brother was the last one who left out of the church because he cut the lights off.... I was going over to the car with him. ...We left the church from the left side. ... People from the right side got beat up, people from the left side didn't get beat up."</p>

<p>Leroy Clemons is an alderman in Philadelphia who also does civil rights tours in Neshoba County and was part of the Philadelphia Coalition that demanded that Killen be brought to justice. He emphasized that you cannot tell the story of the jail without the Mt. Zion church story, which also hinges on Mt. Nebo Missionary Baptist Church in Philadelphia where civil-rights activists used to take shelter and organize. Martin Luther King Jr. led a memorial service there, a monument to Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner is in front of the church.</p>

<p>Obbie Riley, president of the Neshoba County Board of Supervisors and this reporter's stepfather, advocated for the entire story of the entire community to be told. "There were some bad things happened, and there's some good people that's here now," he said "[T]his is a story that is worth telling when it comes down to it."</p>

<p>The special resource study will take place over the next two years, and will accept public comment online and via the mail through June 1.</p>

<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Killen was convicted in 2015, when the correct date is 2005. The story has been updated to reflect that change. We regret the error. </p>

<h2 id="undocumentedandcaughtinthesystem">Undocumented and Caught in the System</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-16</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/16/undocumented-and-caught-system/ </p>

<p>Immigration authorities in Louisiana and Mississippi have filed nearly 3,000 deportation proceedings in the first three months in 2018, data from Syracuse University show. Photo by AP/File Photo</p>

<p>Immigration enforcement officials deported Yesica Paola Rojas-Baten, a 19-year-old Guatemalan woman, in December 2017 when she was flown from Texas to Guatemala. A month later, she was inside an SUV traveling through Hancock County, Miss. When sheriffs pulled over the SUV she was in and another SUV traveling with it, they found 18 total passengers who were all undocumented immigrants, a press release from the U.S. attorney Mike Hurst's office says.</p>

<p>U.S. Border Patrol agents took the passengers to the border-patrol station, and Rojas-Baten was charged in federal court for illegal re-entry. After pleading guilty, she faces up to two years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, and a judge will sentence her in August.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old could face the other side of immigration prosecution through the federal court system, one that has caused outcry and concern due to the Federal Bureau of Prisons' use of private prisons.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the bureau houses undocumented immigrants charged with federal crimes in "criminal alien requirement" facilities. Private prison corporations run the BOP's 11 contract prisons. "The majority of BOP inmates in private prisons are sentenced criminal aliens who may be deported upon completion of their sentence," the Bureau of Prisons website states.</p>

<p>BOP released a report about its private contract prisons in 2016, which revealed the dangerous conditions inside these facilities. One of the private contract prisons, Adams County Correctional Center, is in Natchez, Miss. A correctional officer died there in 2012 when inmates rioted over poor conditions, including inadequate food and medical care.</p>

<p>The Corrections Corporation of America, which runs two of the BOP's 11 contract prisons, ran the Adams County facility at the time. The corporation has since changed its name to CoreCivic but did not lose its contract to operate the Natchez facility. In fact, when Donald Trump became president, CCA and the GEO Group, which runs seven of the 11 federal contract prisons, both saw significant bumps in their stock-market value, Forbes reported.</p>

<p>As of December 2015, more than 22,000 inmates, mainly undocumented immigrants, are housed in the Bureau of Prison's private facilities.</p>

<p>The path to incarceration for undocumented people living in the U.S. largely depends on whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents send them into the immigration courts system or if federal prosecutors charge them with a federal crime. In Rojas-Baten's case, Hurst's office coordinated with ICE officials to charge her with the federal crime of illegal re-entry.</p>

<p>The Facts About Immigration: A Former Border Czar Speaks</p>

<p>How Immigration Courts Work</p>

<p>When ICE agents pick up an undocumented person for the first time, they have several options and discretion to detain a person or not. If ICE agents choose to detain an undocumented immigrant, they are sent to an immigration detention facility. When agents arrest someone in Mississippi and want to detain them, they send them across state lines to Louisiana to Jena or Pine Prairie. There are two immigration courts in Louisiana: one in New Orleans and one in Oakdale.</p>

<p>When Trump became president, he promised a crackdown on undocumented immigrants—not just those who commit federal crimes but anyone who in the country illegally. The White House's strongest focus has been the border. A press release from the White House claims that the number of illegal border crossings has more than tripled in the past year.</p>

<p>"April 2018 was also the second month in a row that saw more than 37,000 individuals apprehended after entering the country illegally along our Southwest border. The need to enforce our laws, secure our border, and close our immigration loopholes has been further underscored by the recent arrival of a 'caravan' of individuals seeking to enter the United States," a White House press release says.</p>

<p>In order for those coming to America to seek asylum, they must come to the border with or without documents to ask for it, however. Mississippi National Guard sent 25 soldiers to the southwest Mexico border last week as a part of "Operation Guardian Support," the latest border security operation from ICE.</p>

<p>"Efforts to remove aliens once they illegally cross our border are hampered by glaring flaws in current statutory law and activist judicial constraints," a White House release says. "As a result, many aliens are apprehended and temporarily detained after illegally entering, only to be quickly released into the interior of the United States."</p>

<p>Data tell a different story, however. Despite the judicial backlog in immigration cases, ICE agents have filed nearly 3,000 deportation proceedings in immigration court for people picked up in Mississippi and Louisiana through March of 2018, Syracuse University TRAC data show.</p>

<p>If this rate continues, 2018 is likely to post the highest number of deportation proceedings filed by ICE in the two states than in recent years.</p>

<p>The majority of these cases are coded as "entry without inspection" or "other immigration charge," meaning the majority of deportation proceedings that ICE agents file in Louisiana and Mississippi are not for undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes.</p>

<p>Rather, despite increasing rhetoric about dangerous immigrants and transnational gangs, the majority of undocumented immigrants waiting for deportation committed the crime of being here illegally.</p>

<p>'This is My Only Chance'</p>

<p>Immigration attorney Amelia McGowan has worked with undocumented immigrants, who are detained in Jena or Pine Prairie in Louisiana, and sees little difference between those facilities and other prisons. She recalled seeing pregnant mothers with chains around their bellies and said everyone has to wear "scrubs" just like jumpsuits in federal or state prison.</p>

<p>Undocumented immigrants going through deportation proceedings could wait for months to see a judge, whereas someone like Rojas-Baten saw a judge quickly in the federal system. If she is sentenced for prison time, she will have to sit behind bars for two years. McGowan said a person charged with "criminal re-entry" will likely not get to see an immigration judge because they will have an active order for removal, meaning after serving their sentence, they will likely be deported immediately.</p>

<p>McGowan is working with some immigrants who are fleeing terrible conditions in their home countries and would rather be in prison than return to dangerous countries where they live.</p>

<p>"I did meet with people in Jena who had re-entered during the Obama administration. Most of them got caught again, and they would say, 'This is my only chance to live,'" she told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Many undocumented immigrants do not have access to legal assistance or attorneys. McGowan said people like Rojas-Baten, who have illegally re-entered the country, can ask a judge to not deport them if they fear for their lives.</p>

<p>"When you re-enter, you are allowed to seek withholding of removal if you can show you would be persecuted," McGowan said. "... You do have the possibility of appealing."</p>

<p>Via press releases, Hurst's office has publicly announced prosecutions against 21 undocumented immigrants this year. The majority of these cases involve immigrants illegally re-entering, like Rojas-Baten, or transporting undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>Young people with DACA status are in flux on a weekly basis depending on what the court says, then the White House, then the court in an endless feedback loop that seems to scream, "Does anyone care?" Photo by</p>

<p>Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>Families are literally being separated. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are arresting more undocumented immigrants now than under the previous administration—nonviolent undocumented men and women as Donald Trump uses scare tactics about dangerous immigrant gangs to justify deportations and splitting up families for just the crime of being undocumented. Many of them fled danger and can be killed or "disappeared" if they return.</p>

<p>Young people with DACA status are in flux on a weekly basis depending on what the court says, then the White House, then the court in an endless feedback loop that seems to scream, "Does anyone care?"</p>

<p>Mississippi's two senators, both supporters of Trump's border wall, doubt the Senate will take up immigration reform in 2018. With more than half a year to go, leaders are leaving families in limbo. State taxpayer dollars are supporting enhanced border security, as the Mississippi National Guard joined several other forces to be a presence on the southwest border between the U.S. and Mexico.</p>

<p>While leaders put off creating any solutions, ICE and the U.S. Department of Justice are implementing their own kind of deportation plan. Attorney General Jeff Sessions wants to have more oversight and say-so into how immigration judges can rule.</p>

<p>Technically, the country's immigration courts are under DOJ's jurisdiction, and as Dara Lind writes for Vox, this means Sessions' power could only increase in the coming months. "[E]ven when a DOJ judge makes a ruling in an immigrant's favor and ICE prosecutors don't try to appeal the ruling, the attorney general's office could sweep in and overrule the judge," Lind writes.</p>

<p>Federal private prisons run by corporations—funded with taxpayer dollars—are the real winners to this approach, particularly if undocumented immigrants are charged in federal court and forced to sit in prison before being deported. The longer Congress waits, the more people will be thrown into a system with apparent rules that Sessions could change whenever he wants.</p>

<p>Congress must act to preserve DACA, implement measures to keep families together, and provide a path to citizenship for all immigrants who have done what they believe is best for their well-being and just do not have the documentation to prove it.</p>

<p>Meantime, if the U.S. is serious about saving lives on either side of the border, it is time to seriously reconsider the escalation of a shortsighted "war on drugs" that Sessions loves to fight.</p>

<p>JACKSON — In the sweltering Wednesday heat, the Jackson Police Department put on its annual Police Memorial Service to honor and commemorate the 17 JPD officers who have died in the line of duty since 1893.</p>

<p>The service opened with the national anthem, pledge of allegiance and a song selection from Erica Taylor, a student at Lanier High School. Then the audience of law enforcement officers, public officials and families of the fallen officers heard comments from Commander Stephen Wells, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the keynote speaker Judge James E. Graves Jr. of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>Commander Wells set the tone for the event, illustrating what goes through an officer's mind every day before starting the job.</p>

<p>"What we have chosen in this profession is to be guardians of the communities of Jackson," he said. "Each day we kiss our own babies before going to work, only to go out and save other babies' lives. Every time we suit up, it's a moment we realize we put our own lives in harm's way."</p>

<p>Chief Moore talked about the first time he experienced a JPD officer killed in the line of duty—Officer Bobby J. Biggert in February 1989.</p>

<p>"It was one of the most horrifying feelings that I felt," Moore said. "And since that time any time that I ever hear that a law enforcement officer loses his or her life, whether it's here in Jackson, Missississippi, or any department, it is a bad bad feeling."</p>

<p>Mayor Lumumba, making what he called unusual brief remarks because of the rising temperatures, encouraged the family members and loved ones in the audience to focus on the positive aspects of the fallen officers' lives.</p>

<p>"I would challenge you to remember them in this regard ... not for the way in which they died but the lives they lived," the mayor said. "Because it is truly life that gives death its great significance. And these are individuals that lived lives of service and commitment to other individuals and that is worth commending more so than the way that they died. And so, we celebrate their lives today."</p>

<p>Judge Graves, a Mississippi native and an Obama-era appointee, spoke about the importance of law enforcement officers, but especially police.</p>

<p>"We are here to honor public servants, those who gave their lives in the line of duty," he said. "And for police officers, that line is the very front line in our criminal-justice system."</p>

<p>After the formal remarks, the families got to pay their respects to their fallen loved ones.</p>

<p>The family of the late Thomas D. Catchings Sr. had seven people go up to the stone memorial in front of JPD headquarters with an escort from the Jackson Police Department/Hinds County Sheriff's Office Honor Guard to bestow a single yellow rose at the base of the monument where Catchings' name and those of other slain JPD officers are etched into a plaque. Each family in attendance or a volunteer went through those same motions, and the families received a potted plant in exchange for placing the rose.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, Temeka Holden-Hutchins, Catchings' oldest daughter, told the Jackson Free Press about what happened to her father the fateful night in March 2005 when he was shot and killed.</p>

<p>Officer Catchings was heading to pick up some of his younger children after he had been at a motorcycle training, she said. Someone who had just been carjacked flagged him down, and Catchings pursued the car. Omar Hampton, 18, had stolen the car and when Catchings caught up with Hampton after he had driven the car into a ditch, Hampton fired his gun. Catchings returned fire, killing Hampton, and he succumbed to his wounds at the hospital later that day.</p>

<p>"I was six months pregnant when it happened...," Holden-Hutchins said. "This was the first grandchild, (my dad) knew I was pregnant and knew I was having a boy, so he was excited about that but he didn't get to meet him."</p>

<p>Holden-Hutchins said that her dad did not have a vest on, as he was off-duty at the time.</p>

<p>A lifetime resident of Jackson, Holden-Hutchins recently moved away to Texas, but still brought her young sons to attend the ceremony Wednesday morning because it means a lot to her.</p>

<p>"It makes you feel special that they're keeping hope alive for everybody else and recognizing the fallen officer," she said. "It's a lot, you know, when you put that uniform on—that's tough. You never know if you're going to come back home to your family."</p>

<p>With 39 homicides in the City of Jackson to date, Holden-Hutchins said she keeps up with the news, and she is not happy with the way thing are going in the City.</p>

<p>"It makes me feel sad that the City is going down like that .... It's just sad, everything that's going on every time you look at the news—The number of homicides, and it's not even summertime yet. It's crazy."</p>

<p>JACKSON — It was a blistering morning, but people from state government, nonprofit and advocacy organizations gathered at the Capitol to launch a public-health campaign, encouraging Mississippians to "think again" about their mental health on Tuesday, May 15.</p>

<p>Diana Mikula, the executive director of the Department of Mental Health, said the "Think Again" campaign is intended to encourage Mississippians to think about their physical and mental health together—and ask for help when they need it. DMH plans to provide community organizations, local hospitals and businesses with information to increase awareness about physical and mental health.</p>

<p>"It's bringing more people to the table. We can't do it in silos, and one agency can't do it alone," Mikula said on May 15.</p>

<p>Mary Currier, the state health officer, also spoke at the Capitol this week. She emphasized that mental and physical health actually impact the other.</p>

<p>"High stress levels are linked to common health issues like high blood pressure...," she said. "... People who are depressed or chronically stressed have a greater risk of illness."</p>

<p>Currier said it is important to eat healthy, get enough sleep and exercise, not just for physical health but also for mental-health benefits. Mikula hopes that the outreach campaign will encourage Mississippians to talk to their health-care providers about mental health. She said some doctors have mental-health screeners at their offices in the state. Otherwise, there are 14 community mental-health centers statewide.</p>

<p>The federal government sued Mississippi in 2016 for its over-reliance on institutionalization to treat mental-health problems statewide. That case is still in discovery. DMH has been in financial hot water at the Legislature in past years as a result—until 2018. The department seemed to shift course and did not ask for an increase in funding in the most recent legislative session. DMH received the same amount of funding that it did last year, as a result.</p>

<p>Mikula acknowledged that the state agencies are maximizing their state funds with DMH and the Department of Health partnering on the "Think Again" initiative.</p>

<p>"Our leadership needs to know that our agencies are working together and we do try to utilize the resources we have before we come asking for more," Mikula told reporters May 15.</p>

<p>The University of Southern Mississippi's College of Nursing Clinical Simulation Lab recently purchased three new patient simulators using a donation from USM benefactors Chuck and Rita Scianna. The patient simulators are manikins from a company called SynDaver Labs and are known as "The Next Generation Harvey."</p>

<p>Nursing undergraduate and graduate programs use Harvey manikins, which have synthetic tissues that mimic the mechanical, thermal and physicochemical properties of human tissue, to teach students about cardiac diseases by having them listen and feel how such diseases affects a patient's heart and lung sounds, and cardiac pulses.</p>

<p>USM purchased two additional patient simulators with the donation, which will arrive on campus later this summer.

<p>USM HOYO Program Hosting Homebuyer Education Workshop</p>

<p>In honor of National Homeownership Month in June, Mississippi Home of Your Own, a program from University of Southern Mississippi's Institute for Disability Studies that helps people with or without disabilities own and maintain their own homes, will sponsor a free, one-day homebuyer-education workshop on Saturday, June 9. The workshop will be from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Jackson Revival Center in the Dr. Raymond O. Biard Multipurpose Center (4655 Terry Road) in Jackson, and is open to residents of Hinds and surrounding counties who are interested in buying a home.</p>

<p>HOYO has helped more than 700 families in 66 Mississippi counties become homeowners since 1997. Applicants of the HOYO program must attend a homebuyer education class to be considered for financial assistance in purchasing a home. The program offers forgivable deferred loans based upon need to eligible borrowers with disabilities in Mississippi. Information about the grants will be available at the June 9 workshop. The Mississippi Council on Developmental Disabilities and BancorpSouth are co-sponsors for the workshop.</p>

<p>MSU Joins Online College Application Platform</p>

<p>Starting Sep. 1, Mississippi State University will allow undergraduate students applying at the university to do so using online college application platform The Common Application.</p>

<p>The Common App provides incoming students with a single online application for any member college or university, and offers 24-hour support for services such as financial aid. The application also features scholarship tools, digital portfolios, virtual mentors, a virtual counselor, an online resource library for counselors and advisors, and Spanish translation services. The platform also introduced a new service this year called The Common App for transfer, which is a separate application for transfer and adult students.</p>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Jason Downs, a Baltimore lawyer who represented the family of Freddie Gray, called a press conference on May 14, 2018, to demand more transparency from the Jackson government on behalf of the family of Crystalline Barnes, 21, who died in an an officer-involved shooting. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — A lawyer for the family of 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes, who died in January when two Jackson Police Officers shot into her car following a traffic stop, stood alongside Barnes' young children and family members Monday as he demanded more transparency from the Jackson government. Jason Downs called Barnes' death an "egregious case" and named one of the officers he believes pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Jason Downs of Downs Collins Law Firm in Baltimore told reporters that an independent investigation showed that JPD Officer Rakasha Adams was directly involved in the shooting of Crystalline. Downs said his investigation showed that Adams had admitted in writing to having difficulty concentrating and that she is easily irritated and angered.</p>

<p>"We have an officer that admits to being easily angered walking the streets of Jackson armed with a gun," Downs said. "We believe that these factors play a role in Officer Adams' unjustified decision to shoot at Crystalline."</p>

<p>Downs said he has an idea about who the second officer at the scene could be, but could not confirm his identity as of yet. He hopes any witnesses his office has not yet spoken to will come forward. The Jackson Police Department said it cannot confirm any of the details shared at the press conference, but that the two officers involved in Barnes' death are still on paid leave per JPD policy.</p>

<p>Holding the presser the day after Mother's Day, Downs pointed to Barnes' children to illustrate the impact of her death.</p>

<p>"Crystalline's two children had to spend Mother's Day without their mother," he said. "Today, nearly four months after Crystalline was shot in the back of the head, the Jackson government still has not updated the family, nor have they updated the public as to the results of their alleged investigation."</p>

<p>Downs was one of the lawyers who represented the family of Freddie Gray in Baltimore following his in-custody death in 2015 resulting from a severed spinal cord. The attorney said his investigation shows that Barnes was shot from behind in the back of the head, which he believes contradicts JPD's account of what happened.</p>

<p>In January, Jackson Police Department spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said the officer who pulled Barnes over in a traffic stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," Holmes' statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect's vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Holmes said Barnes then drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>Downs said his investigation shows that there were no bullet holes in the front windshield or in the front of Barnes' car.</p>

<p>"The investigation shows Crystalline was driving forward, she was shot in the back of the head, and there were absolutely no bullets that traveled through the front of Crystalline's vehicle. The Jackson government has completely failed to address all of these factors—the Jackson government has been silent," Downs said.</p>

<p>Downs also takes issue with the lack of transparency around officer-involved shootings in the City of Jackson. During the press conference, Downs mentioned the U.S. Department of Justice's recommendations to release names as early as 48 hours following the incident, as some cities across the nation have chosen to do, especially since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press has reported that in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice advised police departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident. The DOJ report said that departments can take steps to ensure officer safety during those brief delays.</p>

<p>Jackson, however, has a longstanding policy of remaining tight-lipped throughout the investigation into officer-involved shootings, keeping the public blind about officers' names, whether or not officers get indicted following deadly shootings, or if some of the same officers have been involved in multiple incidents.</p>

<p>"The United States Department of Justice also notes that when a police department fails to provide names of officers after an officer shoots and kills a civilian, that erodes the trust between the community and the police department," Downs said Monday. "The Jackson Police Department has utterly ignored the United States Department of Justice, so we conducted our own independent investigation."</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba developed an officer-identification task force in March to help decide whether to change City policy on not identifying officers following officer-involved shootings. Since the group began meeting in April, the task-force has held three meetings, but has mainly discussed organizational topics rather than delving into the meat of their task.</p>

<p>Downs said he was aware of the task force but that Jackson is still not operating with transparency. He hinted that the City may face a lawsuit if it does not change the policy of keeping the officers' identities and other details hidden.</p>

<p>"We are hoping that Jackson begins to share more information with us, information regarding the identity of the shooters, information regarding exactly what led to the shooting, why there are no bullet holes to the front of the vehicle at all, how she crashed head on, but they claim she was driving backwards somehow," Downs told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"We'd like answers to these questions, and we're hopeful that although they haven't done it as of now, we're hopeful moving forward."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A police officer in Mississippi's capital city is on paid leave as officials investigate whether he unfairly attacked a teen.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Chief Anthony Moore tells local media Tuesday that the department has launched an internal investigation into the incident early Monday.</p>

<p>Moore says reports on the traffic stop conflict but says the department doesn't condone illegal behavior and will discipline the officer for any violations.</p>

<p>The chief made the announcement after parents complained that the unnamed officer pulled John Knight III out of his car, punched him and put a gun to his head without provocation.</p>

<p>Knight was released without charges. His father posted images of his son's cuts and scrapes on Facebook</p>

<p>Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba says he spoke with Knight's father and is deeply troubled.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Voters in central Mississippi's 3rd District are choosing a new member of Congress for the first time in a decade. Candidates have been traveling for weeks to speak at forums and fish fries, and the heavy rotation of advertising—for those who can afford it—is expected to begin close to Memorial Day.</p>

<p>Party primaries are June 5, and if a runoff is needed to choose the Republican nominee, it will be June 26.</p>

<p>Rep. Gregg Harper of Pearl was first elected in 2008 to what was then an open seat because fellow Republican Chip Pickering stepped aside after 12 years. Harper announced early this year that he wouldn't seek another term, saying he thinks a decade in Washington is enough.</p>

<p>The district encompasses all of 20 counties and parts of four others. It runs in a diagonal across the middle of the state, from two counties that touch the Mississippi River in the southwestern corner, up through the more densely populated suburbs of Madison and Rankin counties in the Jackson metro area and further northeast to the college town of Starkville and over to the Alabama line.</p>

<p>Six candidates are in the Republican primary. Because a majority is needed to win, it is likely to go to runoff.</p>

<p>Sally Doty , 51, of Brookhaven, is an attorney and second-term state senator.</p>

<p>Morgan Dunn , 36, of Magee, founded a health care consulting firm, and she and her husband own a restaurant.</p>

<p>Michael Guest , 48, of Brandon, is the district attorney in Madison and Rankin counties.</p>

<p>Whit Hughes , 43, of Madison, is a past deputy director of the state economic development agency and has been foundation president and chief development officer for Baptist Health Systems.</p>

<p>Perry Parker , 52, of Seminary, had a career in international finance, working in Chicago, New York, London and Santa Barbara, California, before moving back to his native Mississippi; he also helped found a bank in Hattiesburg.</p>

<p>Katherine "Bitzi" Tate , 61, of Jackson, is an education consultant.</p>

<p>Two candidates are competing in the 3rd District Democratic primary.</p>

<p>Michael Ted Evans , 42, of Preston, is a second-term state representative and retired firefighter. Michael Aycox , 30, of Newton, is a Navy veteran.</p>

<p>The most recent campaign finance reports show how much money the candidates raised and spent between Jan. 1 and March 31. Hughes led the field, having collected $304,354. Next was Guest, at $280,911.</p>

<p>Parker collected $102,032 and loaned his own campaign $240,000. Doty collected $65,059 and loaned her own campaign $15,802. Dunn collected $30,600 and loaned her own campaign $73,100. Tate did not file a report to the Federal Election Commission.</p>

<p>On the Democratic side, Aycox reported $100 in contributions and Evans did not file a report.</p>

<p>The 3rd District has been considered solidly Republican territory since it was created after the 2000 Census. Mississippi went from five U.S. House districts to four because it had grown more slowly than other states. The current 3rd District consists largely of territory combined from the former 3rd that was represented by Pickering and the former 4th that was represented by Democrat Ronnie Shows. Pickering and Shows were pitted against each other in the redrawn 3rd District in 2002, and Pickering won.</p>

<p>For a Democrat to compete in the general election this year, the party and the nominee will need to quickly accelerate their fundraising efforts.</p>

<p>Winners of the Republican and Democratic primaries will advance to the Nov. 6 general election, and the ballot then will also list Matthew Holland as a Reform Party candidate for the 3rd District.</p>

<h2 id="citycouncilroundupmoneyconcertsandmbi">City Council Roundup: Money, Concerts and MBI</h2>

<p>At the Jackson City Council meeting on May 8, the council voted to approve changes to the departments of parks and recreation, and public works' budgets, among other items. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — At the most recent city council meeting on May 8, the members gathered at City Hall to vote on a variety of issues from shifting budgets, to an ongoing concert and event series in Jackson.</p>

<p>To help with the City's public-works needs, the council accepted Director of Public Works Bob Miller's item that moved $6.9 million from the City's Municipal Sales Tax Commission, which oversees the 1 percent sales tax revenue, into his department. Public Works will use more than $4 million to reimburse the department's capital improvement fund, and the remaining $2 million will go toward the January 2018 winter emergency costs and to repair utility cuts to pavement throughout the City.</p>

<p>"This is a relatively simple matter that amends the budget to reflect the transfer of funds from the municipal sales tax commission to the water and sewer department," Miller said at the meeting.</p>

<p>The council also voted to increase the budget in the Department of Parks and Recreation to fill in for a Bloomberg grant the City has still not received. In a memo to the council, Ison B. Harris Jr., the director of parks and recreation, said that the department is in dire need of 15 more workers and more equipment to keep up with grass maintenance.</p>

<p>In anticipation of receiving this grant in January 2018, the parks department cut positions and transferred six park maintenance workers to Public Works. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at the meeting that the grant was supposed to help the City with a recidivism program that would bring "returning citizens" and hire them to cut grass throughout Jackson. But, until then, the City is moving $285,000 from vacant positions to hire people who will tend weeds in the capital city.</p>

<p>Between the last two meetings, the council has also voted to spend nearly $200,000 from the Parks and Recreation budget to hire musical acts and a promotional team for the City's ongoing Jackson Soulful Music and Event Series. Harris said this money was set aside during budget hearings last year, and with sponsors and charging an admission fee for some of the events, he hopes to at least break even.</p>

<p>"This is our first time doing this," Harris said before the council. "We want to be as successful as we possibly can this first year. ... The idea is to bring people to Jackson and to have fun activities for kids in Jackson."</p>

<p>Ward 2 Councilman Melvin Priester Jr. walked out of the room before voting on the concert items, leaving the council with an even split. First up was the the $25,000 agreement to secure soul singer Betty Wright's performance at the Blues in the Park concert on June 17. The vote came to 3-3, with Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes, Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote and Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps opposing. When Stokes looked over to see that he had sided with Foote, he got up and left the room for the remainder of the votes on the concert series.</p>

<p>"Woah, I can't vote with Foote. Let me walk out of here," he said before slipping out of a side door.</p>

<p>Besides Wright, the City has secured Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Dexter Allen, Erica Campbell, a fireworks show, Howard Hewett, Lakeside, Jekalyn Carr, Small Fire, the Keeshea Pratt Band, Canton Jones, Bobby Rush and William "Zac" Harmon for concerts over the next few summer months.</p>

<p>One day before Jackson's third deadly officer-involved shooting, the council entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations to have the state agency investigate officer-involved shooting incidents and in-custody deaths.</p>

<h2 id="mbiinvestigatesthirddeadlyofficerinvolvedshootinginjacksonin2018">MBI Investigates Third Deadly Officer-Involved Shooting in Jackson in 2018</h2>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/10/mbi-investigates-third-deadly-officer-involved-sho/ </p>

<p>Jackson has three deadly officer-involved shootings at the hands of police officers in 2018, the most recent one on May 9. Photo by Trip Burns/File Photo</p>

<p>JACKSON — The latest deadly officer-involved shooting in Jackson resulted from a traffic stop. A Jackson Police Department officer pulled over Elliot Reed, 30, and Chauncy Reed, 26, apparently brothers, in a white SUV around 1 a.m. on Wednesday at the Valero in the 900 block of Cooper Road.</p>

<p>From there, the details from JPD are vague. A statement says that "following that encounter, shots were fired, both from the suspects and the officer."</p>

<p>The officer, who is now on paid administrative leave per JPD protocol, did not sustain serious injuries. But Elliot Reed was critically injured and transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead by mid-morning. Police took Chauncy into custody at the scene, and charged him with aggravated assault on a police officer and capital murder. Sgt. Roderick Holmes of the Jackson Police Department told the Jackson Free Press that Chauncy is facing the capital murder charge because he was committing the felony of assault on an officer that resulted in a murder.</p>

<p>Aggravated assault on a police officer carries a potential punishment of up to 30 years in prison and no more than a $5,000 fine. Capital murder carries a death sentence, life imprisonment with or without parole.</p>

<p>This represents the third deadly officer-involved shooting of the year following the death of Crystalline Barnes, 21, in January and Lee Edward Bonner, 37, in February.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Bureau of Investigations is investigating this case, as it has done in the Jackson area of late. MBI is also handling the Bonner case from February, after a foot pursuit through west Jackson led to an abandoned house where Bonner allegedly brandished a weapon and two officers fired at least a dozen rounds, killing Bonner.</p>

<p>To formalize the relationship between MBI and the City of Jackson, the Jackson City Council voted on a memorandum of understanding between the two entities to have MBI investigate officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths. The Council voted 6-1, with Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes opposing.</p>

<p>"We don't feel that it is a good practice to investigate yourself in these circumstances," Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba said at the city council meeting. "So to date, they are already prepared to come on scene, but they asked for a formal agreement that would initiate their action in circumstances of officer-involved shootings."</p>

<p>As JPD protocol states in its use-of-force policy, the department will still conduct an internal investigation alongside MBI. The identity of the officer in this shooting is unknown, as has been the case with the last seven other officer-involved shootings in Jackson since Lumumba took office in July 2017—and the lack of transparency likely dates back long before then. The public is not kept abreast of any period of the investigation, even the results of the grand juries that review these cases.</p>

<p>To address this, the mayor established an officer-identification task force by way of executive order in March 2017. The task force is responsible for developing City policy for whether or not JPD will release names of officers who shoot people in the line of duty or keep them private unless a grand jury indicts the officer.</p>

<p>Joe Atkins</p>

<p>OXFORD—My late friend Marty Fishgold, a longtime labor writer in New York City, liked to say that "good journalism is a subversive activity" because it tells truth to power. Veteran Boston journalist Tom Oliphant said "Good reporters are anarchists" because they question all ideologies and authority.</p>

<p>Those are good things, and that's why journalism gets special protection in the First Amendment. It may be the best-known promise in that document and why the constitutions of nations as far-flung as Poland, Brazil, Egypt and Bangladesh include such language as well. One could argue that many of those countries don't practice what they preach. Well, guess what? We don't always, either.</p>

<p>Take the case of Manuel Duran, who currently sits in prison in Jena, La. Duran, who owns the Spanish-language news outlet Memphis Noticias, came to Memphis after working as a reporter in his native El Salvador, a war-and-drug-torn country whose cruelest goons trained at the School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Ga. He's now facing deportation back there, perhaps the equivalent of a death sentence.</p>

<p>Let's consider why he sits in prison in Jena, which Father Michael McAndrew, who works with immigrant communities in Greenwood and north Mississippi, says is one of the "worst detention centers" in the U.S. for its treatment of immigrants.</p>

<p>On April 3 in downtown Memphis, police arrested Duran and eight others who were protesting immigration policies. Police said they were blocking a roadway, and Duran refused to move as ordered. The protest also took place without a permit, police said. Two days later, prosecutors dropped charges against Duran.</p>

<p>He was far from a free man, however. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers immediately arrested him and sent him to Jena. ICE officials said he missed a scheduled appearance in an immigration court in Atlanta in 2007 and thus had since been living in the States without legal status. His attorneys said he received no notice to appear that day, and they have asked the Atlanta court to reopen the case.</p>

<p>If Barack Obama were still president, Duran might be free since he has no criminal history other than misdemeanor driving offenses. Under President Trump, however, none of the 11 million immigrants in this country without full legal status are even temporarily safe from deportation.</p>

<p>"The actions pursued by government officials in this case threaten core First Amendment freedoms that are essential to our democracy," says a federal petition by the Southern Poverty Law Center seeking Duran's release.</p>

<p>Duran's greatest "crime" may be that he has been critical of the Memphis Police Department in his reporting. In July 2017, he reported in a Facebook post allegations that immigration enforcement officials and Memphis police had joined in a traffic stop operation, despite claims that they do not work together. Memphis police asked him to take down the post. His coverage also raised questions about police handling of the case of a Latino immigrant whose body was found in a police impound lot 49 days after he was shot in a robbery.</p>

<p>The Duran case evokes memories of what happened in Jackson to Daniela Vargas, a 22-year-old native of Argentina who had been living in the U.S. since the age of 7. Despite earlier protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, her more recent lapsed status resulted in a March 1 arrest and federal deportation proceedings. A SPLC petition helped win her release nine days later, but her fate remains as uncertain as Manuel Duran's.</p>

<p>If you haven't paid attention to the proposed flood-control/development project called "One Lake" along the Pearl River, now is the time to help vet the ambitious plan. Jacksonians and some Rankin County residents who now pay for flood insurance, as well as some who pay nothing, could be included in the footprint of taxable households to fund the Rankin-Hinds Flood Control District's current lake plan. And if you're included in the new district's boundaries, you need to ensure you would get flood-control benefits.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Legislature gave the district the ability to tax you even if you get "indirect" flood benefits, something so vague in state law that taxpayers should demand answers for what qualifies. The report may go public this month with public hearings as the project's backers look for quick consensus.</p>

<p>Once local comment is complete, the project heads to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for approval. Several wildlife groups oppose the project for its potential negative impacts on the river itself and the local wildlife, like the local extinction of certain species of turtles. Opponents advocate for alternative flood-control options, but lake backers have rejected alternatives with little public input.</p>

<p>Taxpayers need to leave no stone unturned: Why is "One Lake" the best flood-control option? How will it work? Who will pay? Who will benefit from property that will increase in value? Who owns all the property? How will eminent domain work?</p>

<p>Cost-benefit ratios for the previous versions of a lake development along the Pearl were unjustifiable. The "One Lake" proposal will not help localized flooding—such as a drain that overflows during heavy rains or a creek that floods. This project strictly deals with the Pearl River. "One Lake" backers are adamant that it is not about economic development, especially because developing in the floodplain is always a danger, but the same developer of previous versions formed the foundation that is co-sponsoring the study.</p>

<p>Many answers to these questions may be found in the more-than-1,000-page report when it is released. It may be late in the game, but show up to public meetings, call your mayors (Jackson, Flowood, Pearl and Richland), and demand answers before the project is rubberstamped.

<h2 id="texassuitcouldspeeddacaspathtosupremecourt">Texas Suit Could Speed DACA's Path to Supreme Court</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-10</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/10/texas-suit-could-speed-dacas-path-supreme-court/ </p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Three judges have ordered the Trump administration to continue a program that has shielded hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation. Now, a lawsuit filed last week in Texas seeks to shut down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and may create a legal clash that could speed the issue's path to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump's decision in September to phase out the Obama-era program, called DACA, resulted in protests and a failed congressional effort to salvage it. Experts say it's a matter of when, not if, the Supreme Court will rule on the program. It could be the second opportunity for the high court to weigh in on a high-profile decision of the president's, with a ruling on Trump's travel ban expected before the end of June.</p>

<p>Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, said the Texas lawsuit filed May 1 tees up "a fast pass to the Supreme Court."</p>

<p>If Texas and six other states persuade a judge to issue a nationwide order barring the government from continuing DACA, that decision could conflict with existing judges' orders telling the government it must partially continue the program. That's the kind of conflict the Supreme Court generally steps in to address.</p>

<p>The high court has already finished hearing arguments ahead of its summer break at the end of June, and it's rare for the court to hear arguments again before October. But if judges issue conflicting orders on what the government must do with DACA, the court might be asked to make an interim, procedural decision, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell University's law school. The Texas lawsuit "creates even more uncertainty in what is going to happen," he said.</p>

<p>DACA, created in 2012, has provided protection from deportation and work permits for about 800,000 young people who came to the U.S. as children and stayed illegally. A person enrolled in the program gets protection from deportation that lasts two years and can be renewed.</p>

<p>Judges in California and New York have ruled that the Trump administration must allow current DACA participants to renew their enrollments, but the government doesn't have to process new applications. A ruling by a judge in the District of Columbia would require the government to also process new applications, but it has been put on hold until late July.</p>

<p>While these lawsuits challenged Trump's decision to wind down DACA, the lawsuit filed by Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia aims to end it. The states argue the creation of the program was unlawful, an overreach by President Barack Obama, a conclusion the Trump administration agrees with.</p>

<p>And the states filed the case in a way to put it before a potentially sympathetic judge, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas.</p>

<p>Hanen criticized the Obama administration for lax enforcement of immigration laws. And in 2015 he ruled against an expansion of DACA by Obama as well as a program that would have protected the parents of children who are in the country legally. His ruling blocking the programs was upheld by an appeals court. The Supreme Court, short a member after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, was divided 4-4 on the case in 2016, leaving the lower court's ruling in place.</p>

<p>University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck said the Texas case "increases the likelihood of conflicting orders to the government and conflicting substantive conclusions about DACA's legality."</p>

<p>If Hanen sides with the states, he could order the government to immediately stop processing new DACA applications or renewing old ones, which would contradict the existing orders. That would create a "pretty chaotic" situation that the Supreme Court would likely want to resolve, Vladeck said.</p>

<p>Beyond what happens in Texas, two courts of appeal are readying to weigh in on DACA, too. Arguments before the San Francisco-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit are scheduled for Tuesday. And arguments before the New York City-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit are expected this summer.</p>

<p>There is also the possibility that the Trump administration could issue a new memo, replacing one from September, with a fuller explanation of why it chose to wind down DACA, a move that would lead to another flurry of legal filings. The fact the administration hasn't yet done that, though, suggests it may be reluctant to do so.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has seemed eager to get the issue to the Supreme Court quickly. Earlier this year it took the unusual step of asking the high court to hear the California case before a federal appeals court had ruled on it. The high court declined to do so in late February, but it may not be able to avoid the issue for long.</p>

<p>"We're moving toward the Supreme Court," Vladeck said. "How quickly depends on what happens next."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Actors Robert DeNiro and Alec Baldwin are giving some fundraising help to a Democrat hoping to unseat Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Howard Sherman is one of six Democrats in the June 5 primary. He is married to actress Sela Ward, and they have a home near Meridian, Mississippi, where she was raised. The couple previously lived in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Sherman's campaign spokesman David Davis confirms that DeNiro and Baldwin helped host a cocktail party Tuesday in New York, with suggested campaign donations of $1,000 to $5,400 per person.</p>

<p>Wicker faces one challenger in the GOP primary. He sent out his own fundraising email Wednesday, calling DeNiro and Baldwin "mega liberals" who have insulted President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"Alec Baldwin is popular among liberals for his malicious and inaccurate portrayal of President Trump on Saturday Night Live," the Wicker email says. "Robert DeNiro has said the following about our president: 'I'd like to punch him in the face. This is somebody that we want for president? I don't think so.'"</p>

<p>DeNiro also has appeared on "Saturday Night Live," playing special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.</p>

<p>Like many incumbents, Wicker has received campaign contributions from a variety of political action committees, including those pooling money from insurance, energy and financial firms. He also got a $5,000 contribution from Sherman last year, according to Federal Election Commission records.</p>

<p>Sherman has said he donated because Wicker was facing the prospect of a primary challenge at the time by Chris McDaniel, a tea party-backed state lawmaker who nearly unseated longtime U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran in a bitter 2014 Republican primary.</p>

<p>Cochran resigned from the Senate in April amid health concerns, and Republican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed the state agriculture commissioner, Cindy Hyde-Smith to temporarily fill the Senate seat. McDaniel had qualified to challenge Wicker this year, but switched races to challenge Hyde-Smith instead this November for the final two years of Cochran's term. Two Democrats are also in that race.</p>

<p>Sherman was registered to vote as a Republican in California until 2016, when he enrolled in Mississippi, where people don't register by party. He's been his own biggest donor so far. A finance report shows that through the end of March, he had put $500,000 into his own campaign, and had received just one donation, from his campaign manager, for $1,000.</p>

<h2 id="officeridtaskforcewrestleswithmission">Officer ID Task Force Wrestles with Mission</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-09</p>

<p>JACKSON — Sixteen of Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba's 21 appointees to the officer-identification task force gathered at The Cedars in Fondren Monday night to decide if and how the Jackson Police Department will release names of police officers who are involved in shootings, as well as the timeframe in which that would take place.</p>

<p>It was the group's third meeting, five weeks into the effort to resolve difficult questions around exactly when the public has the right to know the identity and circumstances around an officer-involved shooting in Jackson.</p>

<p>The mayor developed this task force under an executive order at the end of March because JPD has a longstanding practice of not releasing names of officers who shoot people, but nothing formally on the books. With eight (there were seven at press time, with another one taking place early Wednesday morning) reported officer-involved shootings since Lumumba took office in July 2017, the mayor seeks a solution through community input, even as he leans toward releasing officer identities.</p>

<p>"It is time that we adopt a city policy which reflects the unique responsibilities and the unique concerns of both law enforcement and the concerns of citizens," Mayor Lumumba said at the first task-force meeting on April 11.</p>

<p>But before the task force dealt with its mission Monday night, it debated whether they should widen the scope even further. The discourse revealed the emotional undercurrents of this issue and also the need for structure and clarity as the task force gets further into the process.</p>

<p>Enter a 'Monkey Wrench'</p>

<p>At Monday's meeting, the task force hashed out something that has been eating away at their progress for weeks: Should the task force also tackle larger criminal-justice issues? Members discussed whether they should ask the mayor to expand the scope of the task force so that the members could also consider procedures such as reworking the City's nearly 15 year-old use-of-force policy and creating policy around excessive force in a broader sense.</p>

<p>JPD Officer Christian Vance made the point that officer-involved shootings, while the circumstances can vary, tend to be more cut-and-dried compared to excessive-force situations that can range from using a Taser to a baton. Vance said that with excessive force, you have to be there to understand the issues at play.</p>

<p>"I am resigned to the fact that people are not always going to understand what I'm doing and that's fine and might see it and be upset, and that's OK if I'm doing my job and doing it correctly," he said. "... How I deal with community policing—policing is not what happens at the call; policing is everything in between the call."</p>

<p>Paul Hobson, a JPD detective and president of the Jackson Police Officers Association, also characterized excessive force as "subjective." The union leader reminded the group that its singular task is to develop policy around officer-involved shootings, without getting into the weeds and particulars of use-of-force policies.</p>

<p>"With respect to use of force, none of us are qualified to make those determinations, so that's my monkey wrench," Hobson said.</p>

<p>Keyshia Sanders, director of constituent services for the City of Jackson and a non-voting member of the committee, urged the group to stay focused on the narrow task because she was concerned about losing some of the volunteers who agreed to serve and develop policy around officer-involved shootings only.</p>

<p>Since Rukia Lumumba, the mayor's sister and a social and economic justice advocate, started attending the task-force meetings, she has served as a de-facto facilitator to help discussions move swiftly and to ensure that those who want to speak get time to do so, and that not all the meetings are in police facilities.</p>

<p>Although the group did not get through all the agenda items Monday, her presence ushered the group toward reaching the consensus that they would stick within the mayor's original order for the task force before getting to deep into other criminal-justice issues in the City.</p>

<p>The group ultimately voted 11-4 to keep the scope narrow, with Rukia Lumumba, Jed Oppenheim of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Nsombi Lambright of One Voice, Inc. and attorney CJ Lawrence who chairs the task force voting nay, and Hobson abstaining from the vote.</p>

<p>Transparency, Debated</p>

<p>Outside the roughly half-dozen police officers who regularly attend the ID task-force meetings, few people have a clear idea of how the Jackson Police Department handles officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>Both police officers and other community members did agree Monday on the need for transparency when an officer shoots someone, but debated whether that means releasing names but no photographs or keeping the names sealed but informing the community regularly about the status of the investigation.</p>

<p>Many came to the table with firm stances about protecting officers' names and identities unless a grand jury indicts them. Two officers spoke about the dangers of the job and the perceived heightened risk of retaliation if their identities are out there.</p>

<p>"How do you assess my danger?" Vance said. "I don't know how you assess an immediate threat to me. ... [W]hen you do release my picture that threat goes up—it's not a problem until it's a problem."</p>

<p>Michael Starks, a Vietnam War veteran also on the task force, passionately agreed with Vance.</p>

<p>"I'm in favor of not putting that officer out front until all the investigation is done, not only for his safety, his family's safety," he said. Starks also advocated for more relationships between the community and JPD.</p>

<p>Many on the task force have expressed concern about releasing a photograph of the officer to the media following an officer-involved shooting. But Lambright said most people in the community already know who the officers are, so the photographs are less of a concern and that people really want to know what happens afterward in terms of discipline.</p>

<p>Lawrence, task-force chairman, agreed with Lambright. "I think that the ambiguity comes in when if I can't even get your photograph, I can't even hear about who it was that it committed the action, then there's no way that I have any understanding of what it is that is truly going on in this particular process...," Lawrence said Monday.</p>

<p>"I think it's the ability not to necessarily tell the community every step of he investigation what's going on, but to keep the community engaged with regard to the fact that something is going on...."</p>

<p>At Monday's meeting, the group agreed to bring in guests from JPD's internal affairs unit, which investigates officer-involved shootings among other accusations against police officers; a representative from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations, which investigates officer-involved shootings in the Jackson metropolitan area; and a representative from the Hinds County district attorney's office, which handles the grand jury proceedings in these cases once an investigation comes to a close and an officer is charged. The task force has not identified the guests, yet.</p>

<p>With their clearer scope in mind, members will reconvene May 21 at a location that has yet to be announced.</p>

<h2 id="ussenatecandidatebarialegalizemedicalmarijuananationwide">U.S. Senate Candidate Baria: Legalize Medical Marijuana Nationwide</h2>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, wants medical marijuana legalized nationwide. The state minority whip is one of six candidates running to be the Democratic nominee for U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker's seat.</p>

<p>"I can tell you without reservation that I am in favor of legalizing medical marijuana that can be prescribed while under a doctor's care," he said May 2 on a telephone town-hall call, answering a caller's question. "I know that medical marijuana has benefits for patients suffering from PTSD and for folks experiencing pain, like cancer patients."</p>

<p>Baria even suggested that legal medical marijuana could reduce opioid use nationwide, which has been deemed a national crisis. Currently, marijuana is illegal at the federal level, although some states have legalized the substance on their own terms. Nine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized marijuana for all uses, including recreational and medical. Mississippi has decriminalized the possession of marijuana under 30 grams for the first conviction.</p>

<p>On the town-hall call, Baria stopped short of supporting legalalizing marijuana for recreational purposes.</p>

<p>"I am in favor of leaving it to the states and keeping the federal prosecutors out of states where it has been legalized, so (in) states like California and Colorado, I don't believe the federal prosecutors should go in there and start prosecuting folks for that," he said.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has taken a hard line on prosecuting marijuana-related charges. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo in January directing all U.S. attorneys to enforce and follow federal laws in regards to marijuana-related "activities."</p>

<p>"[T]oday's memo on federal marijuana enforcement simply directs all U.S. attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country," Sessions said in a Jan. 4 press release.</p>

<p>About six in 10 Americans favor the legalization of marijuana, Pew research shows.</p>

<p>An ACLU analysis found that the large majority of marijuana arrests in the country are for possession, not for selling or distributing. Additionally, African Americans are nearly four times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana, the analysis found.</p>

<p>The primary election for Wicker's seat in Congress is on June 5. Baria, who faces six candidates in the Democratic primary, has raised the most individual donations, FEC filings show. He has more than $120,000 on hand. Howard Sherman has the most funds at his disposal, however, after he loaned his campaign half a million dollars. Other candidates have raised less than $1,000 or do not have campaign-finance reports filed, yet.</p>

<p>Wicker, who faces Richard Warren Boyantan in the Republican primary, has held his Senate seat since 2007. He has $3.4 million in cash on hand, the most recent FEC filings show.</p>

<h2 id="privateprisonontrialinmatesatbleakfacilitytellharrowingstories">Private Prison on Trial: Inmates at ‘Bleak’ Facility Tell Harrowing Stories</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-02</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/02/private-prison-trial-inmates-bleak-facility-tell-h/ </p>

<p>Inmates at EMCF have attempted to get relief from the federal court system since 2013 for appalling health care, sanitation and safety conditions they list in their lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Photo by MDOC</p>

<p>Merlin Hill could not stop shaking as the bailiff led him to the witness stand. The prisoner was still trembling as he raised his right, cuffed hand to swear he would tell the truth on March 15, 2018, in the fourth-floor federal courtroom in downtown Jackson.</p>

<p>Hill, a gaunt white man in his 50s, wore glasses, a white "MDOC CONVICT" shirt and black-and-white striped pants. He was one of 19 inmates who testified during the five-week class-action trial against the Mississippi Department of Corrections for what they describe as appalling conditions at the privately run East Mississippi Correctional Facility near Meridian.</p>

<p>Unlike his appearance, Hill's testimony seemed steadier. Southern Poverty Law Center attorney Jody Owens asked Hill about his medication regimen, a lengthy combination of drugs that, Hill said, helped him feel "normal." Hill said one of his medications, Klonopin, keeps him from shaking, but had run out the night before, just like it does almost every month. He is diagnosed with paranoia, schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder, among other conditions, he said. Without his medication, his disorders can be unbearable.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I have murderous thoughts, suicidal thoughts, it's unbearable sometimes," he told the court.</p>

<p>Hill was convicted of rape in 1998, choosing to serve a life sentence after he opted against taking a plea deal. He is one of more than 1,200 inmates at EMCF where MDOC houses a large population of inmates with mental-health needs.</p>

<p>Eighty percent of inmates at the prison facility are mentally ill.</p>

<p>In 2013, a group of inmates sued the Mississippi Department of Corrections over treatment, conditions and care they claim are unconstitutional at the prison. The litigation dragged on, and in 2015, U.S. Senior District Judge William H. Barbour certified the case as a class-action complaint on behalf of all inmates at EMCF. After failed settlement agreements, the case finally went to trial this spring.</p>

<p>The question at the heart of the case is whether any of the inmates' seven claims, from lack of sanitation or safety to medical care, violate their Eighth Amendment rights to be free from "cruel and unusual punishment."</p>

<p>'Pill Call' Behind Bars</p>

<p>At least two inmates sat in on the trial every day, usually chained around the waist, some handcuffed. Employees from the prison as well as the court bailiff sat behind them or in the public court seating. Attorneys from New York and Washington, D.C., with the ACLU National Prison Project and the private firm Covington &amp; Burling joined local SPLC attorneys to represent the inmates. They were a diverse line-up of men and women, constantly changing who was taking the lead each day.</p>

<p>A smaller group of private attorneys, from Bradley and Phelps Dunbar, who were all white and predominantly male, represented the state. The warden at EMCF, Frank Shaw, usually sat with the defense attorneys and was in court for the majority of the trial. The plaintiffs' presentation lasted nearly a month, with attorneys calling inmates, staff workers at the prison and experts to testify about conditions there.</p>

<p>Inmates testified that EMCF nurses bring their medications to the window of the zone and say "pill call." If they do not make it up to the window at that time or hear the call, they can miss getting their medication altogether.</p>

<p>Warden Shaw testified that sometimes pill call happen on schedule, even as it is set once for the morning and once for the evening. When asked if staff has skipped pill call, Shaw said "it's happened before."</p>

<p>The private prison claims to offer individual and group therapy, but throughout the course of the trial, evidence revealed that the facility only recently opened an acute mental-health unit. Plaintiffs' attorney Erin Monju pointed out in her closing argument that the new facility on Housing Unit 3 is serving about five inmates, with some receiving group therapy and none receiving individual therapy as of trial time.</p>

<p>Inmates also testified to starting fires when they could not get the attention of picket officers or other officers when they needed medical or mental-care attention.</p>

<p>EMCF is one of three operational private prisons in Mississippi, all of which Utah-based Management and Training Company operates. MTC took over the contract to operate EMCF in 2012. Mississippi taxpayers pay MTC over $150 million in contract fees to house about 3,200 inmates in the three private facilities.</p>

<p>MDOC contracts with MTC to run EMCF and also pays Centurion, a subsidiary company of the Centene Corporation to provide medical and mental-health services at the Meridian facility. The State has a monitor, Vernell Thomas, who can oversee the prison and activity there, as a part of its contract agreement. Attorneys representing the inmates used her reports during the trial to show that sometimes she has identified problems that, they said, were never fixed.</p>

<p>MTC, which paid for the private attorneys to defend the State, maintains that the facility is safe, secure and has improved under its management.</p>

<p>"The Southern Poverty Law Center has painted a completely unfair and inaccurate picture of the East Mississippi Correctional Facility. It is nothing like they've described," a statement from the corporation says. "The majority of the inmates who have been at the facility since 2012 would agree they've seen significant improvements in safety and security, quantity and quality of programs, respect, and overall conditions since MTC took over."</p>

<p>Videos created by MTC released during the trial show freshly painted walls and what appears to be a sterile facility. Inmates' testimony depicted different conditions inside, however, and complaints went far beyond missing doses of medication.</p>

<p>Assaults and Gangs</p>

<p>Barry Melton is serving a 40-year sentence for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, but the military veteran did not commit a crime of violence. Instead, violence found Melton when he got to EMCF, he testified in federal court in March.</p>

<p>"I was tied up, beaten for about four hours ... and I was sexually assaulted," Melton said on March 14. He went on to describe being assaulted on July 24, 2016, by "several gang members," who thought he had taken drugs that belonged to them.</p>

<p>"They wanted to check inside me," Melton said. "... He stuck a large magic marker up my rear end to see if I had some drugs (they thought) I'd taken."</p>

<p>Melton bled for almost three months after the assault, even after trying to get medical attention. He saw a nurse on the day of the assault in July but would not see a doctor until September, he said in court. Since his assault, Melton was transferred to another MTC private prison, Wilkinson County Correctional Facility.</p>

<p>His testimony aligned with what other inmates who testified said about gang members running the facility. Warden Shaw would later call Melton a "chronic complainer," saying he tends to make up stories. Shaw also said the Gangster Disciples and Vice Lords have the most members in his facility and that the other gangs fall in line with those two groups. Major gangs such as the Simon City Royals and the Latin Kings are officially allied with those two gangs with members watching their allies' backs.</p>

<p>Shaw and his staff monitor "STG" or security threat groups, he testified, in order to ensure they equalize the numbers of members so they do not manipulate pods.</p>

<p>Gangs are in both public and private prisons in Mississippi. Earlier this year, MDOC and the Mississippi Department of Public Safety corrected the data contained in the state's 2017 gang threat assessment. As of December, about 32 percent, or 6,087 of the more than 19,000 inmates in MDOC custody, claim a gang affiliation. The Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators, a nonprofit made up of law enforcement officials and prosecutors, told The Clarion-Ledger last year that they estimate that 53 percent of verified gang members in the state are white. Black Mississippians make up nearly 62 percent of the inmate population behind bars, however, and only black gang members were prosecuted under the state's gang law from 2010 to 2017.</p>

<p>During the EMCF trial, MDOC's own court monitor, Thomas, would not testify in open court for fear of retribution from gang members. Videos shown in open court revealed inmate-on-inmate assaults with staff either on or off the zone, and in some instances not interfering with inmates at all. The majority of MTC staff are women; the inmate population at EMCF is all men.</p>

<p>Warden Shaw testified that it can be dangerous for his staff to interfere with inmates, especially when they manipulate and take off their handcuffs. Some inmates must wear restraints when they are considered a high security risk outside their cells.</p>

<p>"It can be very dangerous for staff to approach an inmate like that," Shaw said after Owens showed him one recorded incident where staff members stood by while an inmate ran up to another inmate's cell, kicked another inmate through the cell door and ran off.</p>

<p>Shaw has been the warden at Wilkinson County Correctional Facility during his time with MTC as well as at a facility in Arizona called Kingman. In July 2015, inmates rioted at that facility while Shaw was the complex administrator there. Inmates destroyed enough property that the Arizona Department of Corrections had to relocate more than 1,000 inmates.</p>

<p>"The targeted destruction of MTC property, together with the near absence of destruction of inmate personal property and the absence of inmate-on-inmate violence, strongly suggest that the riots were more likely precipitated by inmate dissatisfaction with MTC's operation of the prison than by anger among the inmates themselves," Arizona's Department of Corrections stated in a report.</p>

<p>MTC lost the contract to run Kingman after the riots, and Shaw returned to Mississippi to be warden at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility.</p>

<p>Cause of Death?</p>

<p>Attorneys representing inmates pointed to several inmate deaths as proof that those housed at EMCF are at risk of harm, but the warden maintained that violence and death are at every correctional facility.</p>

<p>"Every correctional facility that I've ever worked at has a different number of deaths. People unfortunately die in custody," Shaw said when Owens cross-examined him April.</p>

<p>"And as people unfortunately die in custody, having four deaths in three months, is that a high number for you?" Owens asked of the deaths at the East Mississippi facility so far in 2018.</p>

<p>"I don't define it as a high number. It's an unfortunate number," Shaw responded. Hill, the inmate who trembled throughout his testimony, testified seeing a man choke to death in the hallway in January.</p>

<p>Rogelio Solis/AP</p>

<p>Another inmate died during the course of the trial in the hospital bringing the death count at EMCF to five this year, Owens said after the trial.</p>

<p>Defense attorneys, technically defending the state in the case, relied on two narratives when it came to inmate harm. First, they argued that the inmates themselves cause a lot of violence and self-harm. When attorneys representing the plaintiffs brought up contraband, weapons and self-harm, often the defense's response was to point to an inmate who tore down the light fixture to make the contraband weapon or clog his toilet by trying to flush items down it.</p>

<p>Lawyers representing the State of Mississippi also said a lot of the plaintiffs' claims were common in other prisons around the state and country.</p>

<p>"When you have 1,200 men who are hardened criminals ... murderers, rapists ... living in close proximity, you're going to have fights," W. Thomas Siler, an attorney defending the State of Mississippi, told Judge Barbour in his closing argument.</p>

<p>The State called Ken McGinnis, a former warden in Illinois who now consults on corrections, as a witness to analyze the rates of assaults in the facility. Using data MTC provided, McGinnis concluded that the rates of assault were not significant.</p>

<p>"And the problem with most of these units, the numbers are so small that statistically it's basically irrelevant, but it gives you some indication of what's going on and where the majority of incidents were occurring with assaults," McGinnis testified. "And not surprising, at least to me, the majority of those were going on in the mental-health area and in segregation."</p>

<p>"Segregation" refers to inmates who are kept in single-unit cells, separate from other inmates and isolated from other parts of the facility.</p>

<p>Attorneys for the inmates argued that McGinnis' numbers were not correct, finding a few reports not included on his list. SPLC counted 160 assaults in 2016 and 99 assaults in the first six months of 2017.</p>

<p>'Not Going to Do It'</p>

<p>Ultimately, a lot of problems at EMCF appear to boil down to staffing levels, testimony revealed. When the state contracted with MTC to run EMCF in 2012, the State sought to cut costs by using a private vendor to operate the facility.</p>

<p>The original contract signed in 2012, on the state's public contract portal, shows that the state only pays $26.24 per minimum-security inmate; $31.19 per medium-security inmate; and $71.11 per single-cell security inmate every day.</p>

<p>At the time, these costs were cheaper than what MDOC was paying to house its own prisoners. Since the initial contract was signed, Commissioner Pelicia Hall has renegotiated the MTC contracts she told lawmakers at the Capitol in April.</p>

<p>"We pay a per diem of about $41.74 in our private facilities because they have to by law operate those facilities at a rate of at least 10 percent less than the Department of Corrections, so they have some blended rates," she said at the Capitol April 23.</p>

<p>However, the bond indebtedness the state incurred on its private prisons is enormous. Mississippi still owes more than $81 million for building EMCF alone, which the State will not pay off until 2023. The State's bond debt totals nearly $218 million on the three operating private prisons and Walnut Grove, which shuttered in 2017—bonds taxpayers will be on the hook for through 2027, MDOC numbers show.</p>

<p>MTC paid for private attorneys to defend the State in the federal lawsuit, because Mississippi law creates immunity for the State in the case.</p>

<p>When MTC came to run the facility in 2012, even defense attorneys admitted the facility was a "bleak place." MDOC and MTC negotiated staffing levels at the time—and then renegotiated them in 2014. The state is paying MTC more than $92 million to run EMCF through July 2022, according to the contract, which was modified in 2017 and is now available for viewing on the Transparency Mississippi.</p>

<p>During the trial, MTC and MDOC employees testified that current correctional officers and medical staff levels cost more than the currently required contract obligation. In other words, both MTC and Centurion are paying some staff with their own money, not the State of Mississippi's money.</p>

<p>Gloria Perry, MDOC's chief medical officer who is a named defendant in the lawsuit, testified that EMCF is still looking for a chief psychiatrist. Perry testified that although Centurion proposed about 60 full-time medical-care employees for the facility in 2016, MDOC proposed to cut that to 43.</p>

<p>"What was the reasoning to do that ... to save money?" Judge Barbour asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. We were under constraints from the (state) contract review board," Perry said.</p>

<p>Barbour asked about the funding that the Legislature cut from MDOC's budget, which might have led to cuts in staff.</p>

<p>"We use the same contract (that requires 43 medical personnel). Centurion added more staff, but they've done it at their expense—the state of Mississippi is not paying for that," Perry testified.</p>

<p>Centurion currently has 52 medical personnel employee openings, and 48 of those are occupied, Monju confirmed during questioning at trial. Centurion is paying for the employees above the 43-employee mark, Perry said.</p>

<p>"They felt that additional staff was necessary," Perry said.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs' attorneys pointed out that Centurion could drop personnel levels back down to 43 employees at any time, due to how the contract is written. Centene provides medical services in all of MDOC prisons, private and public. The most recent contract between MDOC and Centurion runs from July 2016 to June 2019 and is valued at nearly $150 million. It is posted on the Transparency Mississippi website.</p>

<p>MTC also staffs EMCF at higher levels than its contract with MDOC requires. Warden Shaw testified that he has 177 correctional officers on staff at EMCF. He has approved adding officers during his time at the prison. The MTC-MDOC contract only requires 136 officers, however.</p>

<p>"Could you go back to 136?" Owens asked Shaw during trial.</p>

<p>"Not going to do it," Shaw said.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs' attorneys maintained that there is nothing contractually stopping MTC from dropping back to what even their organizations have deemed—by their actions at least—too low of staffing levels at EMCF. Recruitment, especially for mental-health care workers, is a statewide struggle that Judge Barbour alluded to during closing arguments.</p>

<p>"Where does the State of Mississippi find enough state psychiatrists to come to a rural area?" Barbour asked SPLC attorney Elissa Johnson during closing arguments.</p>

<p>Johnson maintained that MDOC has decided to send inmates with mental-care needs to EMCF and that the State enjoys no constitutional exception.</p>

<p>"The Mississippi Department of Corrections has demonstrated deliberate indifference," Johnson said. "... The Commissioner has been aware of these issues since she's been in office."</p>

<p>Martin Horn, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said that private prison contractors will usually do what a state asks them to do—but this is spelled out in the contract.</p>

<p>"I would say typically when we see poor performance in private prisons, the fault is perhaps more with the contracting state or municipality than it is with the private operator," Horn told the Jackson Free Press. "... (Perhaps) the state is trying to do this on the cheap."</p>

<p>Where is the 'Dividing Line'?</p>

<p>Judge Barbour certified the inmates' case as a class-action lawsuit back in 2015.</p>

<p>But after several failed settlement agreements, the case went to trial this spring. Defense attorneys consistently relied on the claim that the prison had improved significantly since MTC took over in 2012.</p>

<p>Barbour, a Ronald Reagan appointee who is a cousin to former Gov. Haley Barbour, seemed intent on moving the trial along whenever he could. By the third week, Barbour vocalized his irritation with the plaintiffs' attorneys.</p>

<p>At one point, ACLU attorney Eric Balaban was questioning Bruce Gage, a psychiatrist and expert witness in the case. Gage described the risks of inmates being isolated in segregation unit.</p>

<p>"Did you find anything that was done right with medical at EMCF?" Judge Barbour asked Gage.</p>

<p>"Prescribers were a bright spot," he said, noting that the medical staff at EMCF seemed to be giving inmates what he viewed to be the proper medications for their conditions in most instances.</p>

<p>Balaban continued to question Gage, but Barbour seemed irked. He grew impatient with the style of questioning. When Balaban asked to show a video, the judge refused to see another one. He told him to move along with his testimony, but when Balaban returned to his prepared questions for Gage, Barbour cut him off.</p>

<p>"Why can't you change so you don't irritate the judge?" he asked. "... The mental health is not good. You don't have to prove every mental-health problem in this prison." Barbour cut Balaban's questioning off and ended court 10 minutes before he normally did, telling the plaintiffs to shorten their testimony in the coming week.</p>

<p>Judge Barbour toured the prison facility after the plaintiffs' attorneys concluded their arguments and before the defense's rebuttal. Attorneys for both the defense and the plaintiffs, along with the warden, toured the facility before Easter weekend. EMCF was in the midst of an audit from the American Correctional Association at the time of the visit.</p>

<p>"My observation from the tour of the prison was it was pretty well spit-shined. Unit 5 (the segregation unit) had been repainted and appeared to be clean," Barbour said. "... Should I take that with a grain of salt with plaintiffs noting that ACA came in three days before?"</p>

<p>Rogelio Solis/AP</p>

<p>Siler said the facility is in good condition and could not recall it looking any different. The State requires ACA to certify all its private prisons and to audit the facilities every three years. EMCF passed its past ACA inspection and is compliant with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Barbour was looking for what he called the "dividing line." He asked Johnson and Monju repeatedly where the line was when it came to what level of mental and medical health care is needed for inmates or what rate of assaults is commonplace in other prison facilities.</p>

<p>"Don't assaults happen at every prison handling mental-health inmates?" he asked Johnson during closing arguments.</p>

<p>Neither party seemed to budge on their views that the prison was in bad shape or just fine.</p>

<p>"I can't get the plaintiffs to say anything good, and I can't get the defendants to say anything is wrong," Barbour said.</p>

<p>Beyond the dividing line, Barbour was also looking for a potential solution. He repeatedly asked Johnson and Monju, "What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>Technically, the complaint asks the court to rule on seven specific grievances, deeming the treatment of prisoners unconstitutional. It also asks the judge to order MDOC to develop a plan to address the "substantial risks of serious harm" to inmates in the facility, and for the defense to pay their attorneys' fees.</p>

<p>During closing arguments, Monju and Johnson said the judge could order a staffing analysis at the facility or mandate that MDOC create an oversight system or appoint a monitor to the prison.</p>

<p>None of these remedies is listed in their complaint, however.</p>

<p>Owens and Johnson said their requests for relief are broad solutions because there are several different approaches to remedies.</p>

<p>Ron Welch, a retired Mississippi prison litigation attorney, says in most of the major prison cases where a judge takes action, he or she will appoint a court monitor to come in and inspect the prison regularly for progress, depending on what conditions need to change.</p>

<p>"I think if you have a neutral third party, the judge can appoint an expert to go in and look and report every quarter, at a minimum," Welch said in an interview.</p>

<p>Welch explained that sometimes judges will order attorneys to submit proposed findings of fact and then issue an order based on those briefs.</p>

<p>But Barbour would not even let plaintiffs' attorneys argue for post-trial briefing. Instead, he asked each side for a list of cases they referenced in closing arguments. Judge Barbour could also direct the legal teams for both parties to come up with an agreement to remedy any grievance he finds to be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Barbour will have to decide if any of the seven claims amounts to "cruel and unusual punishments" defined in the Eighth Amendment. If the judge believes some of the inmates' claims are credible, he will have to decide how to hold MDOC responsible for its contracts that have led to conditions at EMCF.</p>

<p>"This is the problem with private prisons," Welch said. "How the hell do you enforce it when they screw up?"</p>

<p>Future of Private Prisons</p>

<p>After the State passed a massive criminal-justice reform package in 2014, the number of incarcerated Mississippians dropped, leading to less of a need for private prisons. Or at least, that is what MDOC claimed when it closed Walnut Grove Correctional Facility, which was at the heart of a 2010 federal lawsuit and a U.S. Department of Justice investigation in 2006 for its maltreatment of youth who were previously housed in the facility until they were old enough to transfer to adult prisons.</p>

<p>In 2010, the ACLU Prison Project and SPLC sued the Walnut Grove Correctional Facility over conditions and won a consent decree for the facility. Inmates in that case testified about riots, violence and staff members smuggling contraband inside the prison. Similar to the EMCF case today, MTC had taken over the contract at Walnut Grove and alleged that conditions had greatly improved.</p>

<p>In 2015, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves kept the facility under the consent decree. A year later, MDOC closed the prison permanently.</p>

<p>"MDOC's budget is lower than what we anticipated," then-Commissioner Marshall Fisher said in a press release in 2016. "Pursuant to an intensive budget review and evaluation, we have determined this is the most prudent action. We have the space in our state-run prisons to house the 900 inmates at Walnut Grove."</p>

<p>Former MDOC Commissioner Chris Epps signed all of the initial private-prison contracts with MTC. Epps was the epicenter of a massive bribery scandal, which landed him and Carl Reddix of Health Assurance LLC, which previously provided health care at EMCF, in federal prison.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jim Hood filed 11 racketeering civil lawsuits in response to the Epps scandal in 2017, including against MTC and Health Assurance LLC, for conspiring with Epps in the bribes. Neither of those claims has been settled.</p>

<p>The civil suit against MTC accuses the corporation of contracting with former Rep. Cecil McCrory of Rankin County to lobby on their behalf in order to secure a contract with Epps.</p>

<p>"MTC and McCrory pursued a common plan and course of conduct, acted in concert with, aided and abetted and otherwise conspired with one another, in furtherance of their common scheme to defraud the State," the suit says.</p>

<p>"MTC knew, or should have known, that the 'consulting fees' it was paying Defendant McCrory were being used to pay bribes and kickbacks to assure that Defendant Epps would award public contracts, paid for by the State, to MTC."</p>

<p>Both Epps and McCrory are in federal prison; Epps is housed in Texas, and McCrory is in Alabama. MTC maintains that it was not aware of the bribery scheme.</p>

<p>"MTC hired McCrory as a lobbyist to communicate with state leaders about the progress we were making in the Mississippi prisons we operated," a statement from the corporation says.</p>

<p>"We had no idea he was sharing what we paid to him with Chris Epps. We terminated his contract immediately when we heard the reports."</p>

<p>While Mississippi taxpayers owe millions of dollars for private-prison bonds, they did not have to pay to defend the state in the EMCF trial. State law says that "the contractor shall defend any suit or claim brought against the State of Mississippi arising out of any act or omission in the operation of a private facility, and shall hold the State of Mississippi harmless."</p>

<p>MTC would not release the cost of litigation attached to paying for private attorneys to the defend the State for the last month. Whether or not Mississippi needs private prisons to house its population of around 19,000 inmates is also at the heart of this case.</p>

<p>On April 9, the sun lit up the federal courthouse on the day of closing arguments, and a few pastors gathered to pray on the steps. CJ Rhodes, the president of Clergy for Prison Reform, said his group formed in 2015 during the Walnut Grove trial. His group wants to reduce and eventually eradicate any private-prison contracts in Mississippi.</p>

<p>"I'm not convinced that if you have a profit motivation, you're concerned about making prisons humane," Rhodes said outside the courthouse.</p>

<p>" ... The criminal justice system (should be) about rehabilitation."</p>

<p>Rhodes said his understanding of the gospels in the Bible lead him to believe that all people have an opportunity for redemption. He hopes Judge Barbour is not "soft" on the prison in his ruling.</p>

<p>Barbour said he will issue a written opinion. He did not allow plaintiffs' attorneys to petition for post-trial briefing. He adjourned court before noon on Monday, April 9, as he crumbled up several pieces of paper sitting in front of him, clearly ready for a vacation.</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-07</p>

<p>Rep. Jay Hughes of Oxford said the state needs to improve public education, highways and mental health services. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — First-term Democratic state Rep. Jay Hughes of Oxford announced last week that he is running for Mississippi lieutenant governor in 2019, saying the state needs to improve public education, highways and mental health services and create a lottery.</p>

<p>Hughes , 54, said current state leaders are not squarely facing the state's challenges.</p>

<p>"I believe that commonsense problem solving is what we need a lot more of, instead of spin and political posturing," Hughes told a few dozen people during a campaign kickoff at a Jackson hotel.</p>

<p>"Mississippi problems are not miraculously cured and fixed by ignoring them.... The first step in solving a problem is admitting there is one," he said. "And I'm tired of hearing career politicians in Mississippi claim that everything — everything — is great for jobs, economy, food on the table, college students not really leaving, roads and bridges are fine. They aren't."</p>

<p>Hughes is the first candidate to announce for what will be an open seat. Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves is limited to two terms and is preparing to run for governor.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate and has considerable influence over which bills become law.</p>

<p>Republican Delbert Hosemann, the third-term secretary of state, is widely considered another possible candidate for lieutenant governor.</p>

<p>Republicans hold seven of eight statewide offices in Mississippi. The last person elected lieutenant governor as a Democrat was Amy Tuck, in 1999. She switched to the Republican Party in late 2002 and won a second term the next year.</p>

<p>Hughes is an attorney and developer and served as an Oxford alderman before winning a House seat in 2015. He's also a U.S. Army veteran.</p>

<p>During the campaign kickoff, he spoke about growing up poor in south Louisiana and east Texas. He said his biggest influence was the grandfather he called Poose, who hand-dug sewer ditches for a city water department and taught him to work hard.</p>

<p>"I didn't get my values from some national political party or a cable news program," said Hughes, who was joined on stage by his wife, Cris, and their daughter, Patricia. "I got them from my parents and grandparents at home, at church and at the school of hard knocks."</p>

<p>Democratic former Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove said after the event that he is backing Hughes because he believes Hughes has joined Democratic Sen. Hob Bryan of Amory as one of the most vocal supporters of public schools.</p>

<p>"Jay Hughes has been a consistent voice for improving and investing in education," said Musgrove, who served two terms in the state Senate and one as lieutenant governor before serving as governor from 2000 to 2004.</p>

<p>Answering questions after his speech, Hughes said he used to consider himself a Republican and has long voted based on which candidate he prefers, not a party label. He said he doesn't know when he started considering himself a Democrat, but he has been elected to both offices under that label.</p>

<p>Hughes has been a frequent critic of Republican leaders in the Mississippi House and is known for frequent social media posts giving his own ideas about education funding and other issues.</p>

<p>State GOP chairman Lucien Smith said in a statement: "Jay Hughes is an Oxford liberal best known at the Capitol for not supporting gun rights, running from legislation to protect the unborn, and generally achieving nothing except getting his name in the papers. Mississippi voters should reject him just as they've rejected other liberals like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama."</p>

<p>In 2016, Hughes sued Republican House Speaker Philip Gunn for using a computer-generated voice to read bills aloud in the House chamber. Reading aloud is a common filibuster tactic used by opponents to issues being debated, and House Democrats forced readings in March 2016 because they thought their ideas were being ignored by the Republican supermajority.</p>

<p>Hughes said in the lawsuit that Gunn had violated the Mississippi Constitution by setting the machine to read so quickly that the bills could not be understood. Hughes also said lawmakers were calling it a "demon chipmunk" voice. The state Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that it has no power to settle a dispute over how the Legislature operates.</p>

<h2 id="sheriffsdecrycutbacksprivateprisoncontracts">Sheriffs Decry Cutbacks, Private Prison Contracts</h2>

<p>MDOC Commissioner Pelicia Hall defended her decision to pull inmates out of regional facilities due to budget constraints at the Capitol on Monday, where sheriffs had gathered to tell lawmakers they were going to be in funding danger. Photo by File Photo/MDOC</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi sheriffs packed into Room 113 at the Capitol Monday to express frustrations after the Mississippi Department of Corrections announced a reduction in inmates housed at the 15 regional facilities in the state even as taxpayer money is going to fund private, corporate-operated prisons.</p>

<p>MDOC Commissioner Pelicia Hall said she had no choice fiscally but to pull inmates out of regional facilities. MDOC had budget problems at the start of 2018 and asked the Legislature to help fund its budget deficit. The Legislature came up with $7 million to fund MDOC's request for the state's private-prison bond obligations and medical costs for inmates—but stopped short of providing the $3.6 million deficit the department requested for the regional correctional facilities.</p>

<p>Even House Corrections Committee Chairman Bill Kinkade, R-Byhalia, admitted the challenges in corrections funding on Monday.</p>

<p>"The fact is we have funding issues in corrections. That's not a revelation to anybody," he said. "There have been some deficit-spending issues, and all of them haven't been addressed."</p>

<p>MDOC currently houses medium- and low-custody inmates at the 15 regional facilities, run by 22 counties and local sheriff departments in the state. The counties own these regional facilities, and MDOC pays the counties at a range from $20 to $29.74 per inmate per day, depending on the county's bond indebtedness. Counties and sheriffs use these funds to help pay off bonds or balance their budgets.</p>

<p>If the department removes inmates from regional jails, local counties and sheriffs' departments will receive less funding than they do currently from MDOC to house state inmates.</p>

<p>William Allen, an attorney who represents the Mississippi Sheriffs' Association, pointed out that the State initially asked the counties to build the regional facilities back in the late 1990s and early 2000s to house the ballooning state prison population. The State also contracted with private-prison contractors to operate facilities they built during this time. Fast forward two decades, however, and Mississippi passed substantial criminal-justice reform measures in 2014 that led to a drop in inmate population statewide, lessening the need for cells. MDOC closed the Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in 2016, citing budget reasons and less need for space.</p>

<p>"We're struggling financially; we're struggling to keep the lights on in these facilities," Allen told lawmakers on Monday.</p>

<p>Allen and sheriffs questioned the State maintaining contracts with private prison corporations when they are cutting funding to regional and local jailers at the same time. Some sheriffs testified about being unable to repair their buildings or keep prison guards employed without funding for adequate salaries.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the regional jails weren't funded while the private prisons were. The private facilities have been funded, and you may have seen one of these facilities in the news lately," Allen said referring to the class-action lawsuit against the East Mississippi Correctional Facility in Meridian brought by prisoners for lack of treatment and bad conditions.</p>

<p>Commissioner Hall is in a tough spot, however. The State contracts with the Management and Training Corporation to run the three operational private prisons; those contracts were signed before her tenure began. Those agreements require certain inmate population levels and payment guarantees.</p>

<p>"There's a prison-population guarantee that the State is required to have with those facilities," Hall told lawmakers on Monday. "... And to remove those potential inmates, the State would have to basically renegotiate or re-do those particular contracts whereby we're not obligated to fill those beds."</p>

<p>Additionally, Hall said that the private prisons house medium- to high-security level inmates, as well as inmates with special mental-health needs like at EMCF, while the regional facilities house state inmates considered to be low- or medium-custody. With the Legislature's criminal-justice reforms, Hall said the dynamics of the prison system will change over time.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, the low-level offenders are not going to be the ones spending those long sentences in the county jails, and that's just the nature of the beast that comes with criminal-justice reform," she said. "I think in this state we built too many prisons, and we were over-incarcerating at some point. Well, the trend has turned."</p>

<p>MDOC pays about $41.74 per inmate per day in a private prison, Hall said. At the Capitol on Monday, she said that the contract for Wilkinson County Correctional Facility is up for renewal in June this year, and she is having her staff prepare a request-for-proposal for contractors to bid on. She said she is also considering bringing the operations there back in-house.</p>

<p>The State still owes more than $217 million in bond indebtedness on private prisons, and taxpayers will pay for those bonds, including for the closed Walnut Grove, until 2027, MDOC numbers show.</p>

<p>These bond costs are in addition to the State's contractual obligations to MTC to operate the facilities and to other contractors such as Centene Corporation to provide medical care in the state's prison system.</p>

<p>County taxpayers in the 22 counties that issued bonds to open regional prisons will have to foot the bill for those facilities, however, which is why the room was tense on Monday. There are about 3,000 inmates in the state's three private prisons, while regional facilities house more than 4,000 inmates.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, it comes down to funding, and just like you all have needs and issues in your regional facilities, we have them in the Department of Corrections, too," Hall said.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court has so far had little to say about Donald Trump's time as president, even as the nation has moved from one Trump controversy to another. That's about to change.</p>

<p>The justices' first deep dive into a Trump administration policy comes in a dispute over the third and latest version of the administration's ban on travel from some countries with majority Muslim populations. Opponents of the policy and some lower courts have labeled it a "Muslim ban," harking back to Trump's campaign call to keep Muslims from entering the country.</p>

<p>The high-stakes arguments at the high court on Wednesday could offer some indication about how a court that runs on respect for traditions and precedent will deal with a president who regularly breaks with convention.</p>

<p>Apart from the campaign statements, Trump's presidential tweets about the travel ban and last fall's retweets of inflammatory videos that stoked anti-Islam sentiment all could feature in the court's discussion of the travel ban's legality.</p>

<p>"The court could get to the right outcome without getting into the question of his tweets. But I think the president set it up so that it's virtually impossible to ignore him when he's shouting from the rooftops about what his purpose was in the three versions of the ban," said Cecillia Wang, the American Civil Liberties Union's deputy legal director.</p>

<p>Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who will argue the administration's case, said in a court filing that the ban is well within the president's authority and is not based on prejudice against Islam.</p>

<p>In a sign of heightened public interest, the court is taking the rare step of making an audio recording of the proceedings available just hours after the arguments end.</p>

<p>One key issue will be how the court evaluates administration actions.</p>

<p>Neil Eggleston, President Barack Obama's last White House counsel, suggested in an online forum last week that Trump does not merit the same measure of latitude that courts usually give presidents, especially in the areas of national security and immigration.</p>

<p>"The court will have to wrestle with how much to defer to a President who has created this record of chaos and animus," Eggleston and co-author Amanda Elbogen wrote on justsecurity.org.</p>

<p>Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, cautioned that the court would be breaking new ground if it were to treat Trump differently from other presidents.</p>

<p>The policy under review at the court applies to travelers from five countries with overwhelmingly Muslim populations — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It also affects two non-Muslim countries: blocking travelers from North Korea and some Venezuelan government officials and their families. A sixth majority Muslim country, Chad, was removed from the list this month after improving "its identity-management and information sharing practices," Trump said in a proclamation.</p>

<p>Francisco said the Chad decision shows that the restrictions are premised only on national security concerns. He also said that the State Department has cleared more than 430 visa applicants from the affected countries for waivers that would allow them to enter the U.S.</p>

<p>But the challengers argue that the administration cannot ask the court to ignore all that has happened.</p>

<p>Trump's first travel ban was issued just a week after he took office in January 2017, and was aimed at seven countries. It triggered chaos and protests across the U.S. as travelers were stopped from boarding international flights and detained at airports for hours. Trump tweaked the order after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco refused to reinstate the ban.</p>

<p>The next version, announced in March 2017, dropped Iraq from the list of covered countries and made it clear the 90-day ban covering Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen didn't apply to those travelers who already had visas. It also eliminated language that would give priority to religious minorities. Critics said the changes didn't erase the ban's legal problems.</p>

<p>The 9th Circuit and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, agreed with the ban's opponents. The 4th Circuit said the ban "drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination." The 9th Circuit ruled that Trump violated immigration law.</p>

<p>The third version is indefinite, unlike the other two, and the administration said it is the product of a thorough review of how other countries screen their own citizens and share information with the U.S.</p>

<p>It fared no better than its predecessors in the lower courts, but the Supreme Court said in an unsigned order in December that it could take full effect while the legal dispute continues. The justices said nothing about the substance of the policy, either in December or in earlier actions involving the ban.</p>

<p>Now, though, they are confronted with the administration's view that Trump has broad discretion to impose limits on immigration and that the courts don't even have a role to play. The Justice Department has said throughout the course of the legal fight that the lawsuits challenging the policy should be dismissed without ever reaching the challengers' claims. The administration says that foreigners have no right to enter the United States and no right to challenge their exclusion in American courts.</p>

<p>Supporting briefs for the ban's challengers dwarf filings on the administration's side. Retired high-ranking military officers, former Republican officeholders, Catholic bishops, Amazon, Facebook and 113 other companies, the children of Japanese-Americans who were held in internment camps during World War II and more than a dozen mainly Democratic-led states are among those calling on the court to strike down the Trump policy.</p>

<p>The administration's supporters include roughly the same number of Republican-led states, as well as conservative groups and Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's personal lawyers.</p>

<p>A decision in Trump v. Hawaii, 17-965, is expected by late June.</p>

<p>Panelists discussed childhood trauma, re-entry and mental health at the City of Jackson's Crime and Justice Summit at the Jackson Convention Center on April 19, 2018. The panelists were, from left to right, Larry Perry, Devon Loggins, Tiffany Anderson Washington, Fallon Brewster and Etta Morgan. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — A panel of Mississippi-based professionals sat in black leather armchairs on the stage of the Jackson Convention Center's theater on April 19. Larry Perry, Devon Loggins, Tiffany Anderson-Washington, Fallon Brewster and Etta Morgan were there to lead a panel discussion for the City of Jackson's Crime and Justice Summit.</p>

<p>The conversation went in several directions, but at the core, the panelists and the audience addressed childhood trauma, re-entry services and how to better support victims of crime.</p>

<p>But, some pivotal and controversial crime issues in Jackson were left off the table for the most part, such as officer-involved shootings and Project EJECT, although U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst had come to the summit with his two youngest daughters in tow. He left before the conversation got started, however. He is leading Project EJECT in the capital city under the direction of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, working with the Jackson Police Department and other agencies.</p>

<p>Some members of the Jackson Police Department briefed the room on this year's crime stats as well as the Interim Chief of Police Anthony Moore's hopes for Jackson in the near future: new police cars, a larger police force and community-oriented policing.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>"I just want to say that I'm a strong advocate of community policing. It's my goal as chief and for the officers of this department to have a strong partnership with the community and a strong commitment," Moore said.</p>

<p>Then Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba took the microphone, speaking of his brother who is 16 years his senior, who was shot in the head in Jackson in the early 1990s but survived. Referring to himself as a "recovering attorney," the mayor also spoke from the familial perspective, saying he wants a fruitful, honest, productive conversation about the criminal-justice system.</p>

<p>Of Stigma and Trauma</p>

<p>Etta Morgan, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at Jackson State University, served as the moderator. She prefaced the panel's dialogue with a message about stigma.</p>

<p>"I tell my students that you want to talk about a convict as long as it's not in your family," she said. "When it's in your family, you say 'my cousin made a mistake.' Your cousin is also a convict. So don't try to ostracize the person down the street and you have family members with the same issue. We need to embrace and retool those persons in the community."</p>

<p>Devon Loggins, president and CEO of Methodist Children's Homes of Mississippi; Larry Perry, president and CEO of New Way Mississippi, which does reentry work in Jackson; Tiffany Anderson Washington, coordinator of mobile crisis response at Hinds Behavioral Health Services, and Fallon Brewster, Jackson Medical Mall Foundation's VP of marketing and communications joined Morgan on stage.</p>

<p>Loggins, who used to work in prisons, focused on youth trauma. He said that he found that many of the incarcerated people over 18 he worked with had identical backgrounds of trauma as the kids in the Methodist Children's Homes.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to get you to make the connection between childhood trauma, those experiences that kids have no control over whatsoever, abuses that have been perpetrated against them. They're hungry, they don't have anyone," Loggins said.</p>

<p>He added that the anger and poor decisions can result from traumatic events during childhood, such as witnessing or being a victim of violence, which can cause a person to act out or become violent and caught up with law enforcement, Loggins said.</p>

<p>Brewster, who grew up in Georgetown, put the onus on communities having each other's backs, especially when people shy away from therapy.</p>

<p>"When communities feel empowered, and they know each other, and they have those relationships with each other— there's a lot of counseling that can go on amongst the community," she said. "What I've learned was just knowing your neighbors and just understanding what they're going through, you may not be as comfortable going to a counselor, but you can talk to your neighbor...."</p>

<p>Perry, who does re-entry work in Jackson, said the perception of crime in Jackson can be worse than the actual crimes taking place, and that people here spend a lot of time talking about the problem and complaining rather than focusing on solutions.</p>

<p>JPD Assistant Chief James Davis said that he wanted more of the resources on hand that Perry offers because he has had people come to the police department after getting out of prison, asking for things to do so that they will not return there.</p>

<p>"Everybody (doesn't) want to go back to prison, so we have to have that avenue where we can direct them," Davis said to the room.</p>

<p>Needed: Better Police Treatment and Protocol</p>

<p>Then came community voices asking for better treatment and protocol by law enforcement.</p>

<p>Lucinda Wade-Robinson asserted herself to get a chance to speak—she said she had been skipped over as she sat at least eight rows back from the stage. Her son was murdered in Jackson in front of their house as she and other family members sat inside in 2014. She said she and her family were treated horribly by officials, from the police investigator to the Mississippi attorney general's office.</p>

<p>"We were not treated like victims, we were treated like criminals, and the young men that did this, they were treated like they were the victims," Wade-Robinson told the room.</p>

<p>Wade-Robinson said the only person from the City who had reached out to her was Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps, leading Mayor Lumumba to interject that it was before his time in office.</p>

<p>The mother who lost her son said she did not want to bash law enforcement, whom she appreciates and even prays for, but that she wants better treatment for the families of victims in the future. She implored the mayor to reach out to the victims of violent crimes as they learn to cope with a lifetime of grief.</p>

<p>"You learn to deal with it but it does not get better—it has not gotten better for me," Wade-Robinson said. "I miss my son more and more every day, and it has not gotten better. And he was murdered over a vehicle ... people mean more than things. He was murdered over a raggedy piece of junk. It was a car that was not running."</p>

<p>"...I feel that things are going to change now that we're under a new mayor. I commend him for what he has done so far," she added.</p>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-24</p>

<p>MDOC Commissioner Pelicia Hall defended her decision to pull inmates out of regional facilities due to budget constraints at the Capitol on Monday, where sheriffs had gathered to tell lawmakers they were going to be in funding danger. Photo by File Photo/MDOC</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi sheriffs packed into Room 113 at the Capitol Monday to express frustrations after the Mississippi Department of Corrections announced a reduction in inmates housed at the 15 regional facilities in the state even as taxpayer money is going to fund private, corporate-operated prisons.</p>

<p>MDOC Commissioner Pelicia Hall said she had no choice fiscally but to pull inmates out of regional facilities. MDOC had budget problems at the start of 2018 and asked the Legislature to help fund its budget deficit. The Legislature came up with $7 million to fund MDOC's request for the state's private-prison bond obligations and medical costs for inmates—but stopped short of providing the $3.6 million deficit the department requested for the regional correctional facilities.</p>

<p>Even House Corrections Committee Chairman Bill Kinkade, R-Byhalia, admitted the challenges in corrections funding on Monday.</p>

<p>"The fact is we have funding issues in corrections. That's not a revelation to anybody," he said. "There have been some deficit-spending issues, and all of them haven't been addressed."</p>

<p>MDOC currently houses medium- and low-custody inmates at the 15 regional facilities, run by 22 counties and local sheriff departments in the state. The counties own these regional facilities, and MDOC pays the counties at a range from $20 to $29.74 per inmate per day, depending on the county's bond indebtedness. Counties and sheriffs use these funds to help pay off bonds or balance their budgets.</p>

<p>If the department removes inmates from regional jails, local counties and sheriffs' departments will receive less funding than they do currently from MDOC to house state inmates.</p>

<p>William Allen, an attorney who represents the Mississippi Sheriffs' Association, pointed out that the State initially asked the counties to build the regional facilities back in the late 1990s and early 2000s to house the ballooning state prison population. The State also contracted with private-prison contractors to operate facilities they built during this time. Fast forward two decades, however, and Mississippi passed substantial criminal-justice reform measures in 2014 that led to a drop in inmate population statewide, lessening the need for cells. MDOC closed the Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in 2016, citing budget reasons and less need for space.</p>

<p>"We're struggling financially; we're struggling to keep the lights on in these facilities," Allen told lawmakers on Monday.</p>

<p>Allen and sheriffs questioned the State maintaining contracts with private prison corporations when they are cutting funding to regional and local jailers at the same time. Some sheriffs testified about being unable to repair their buildings or keep prison guards employed without funding for adequate salaries.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the regional jails weren't funded while the private prisons were. The private facilities have been funded, and you may have seen one of these facilities in the news lately," Allen said referring to the class-action lawsuit against the East Mississippi Correctional Facility in Meridian brought by prisoners for lack of treatment and bad conditions.</p>

<p>Commissioner Hall is in a tough spot, however. The State contracts with the Management and Training Corporation to run the three operational private prisons; those contracts were signed before her tenure began. Those agreements require certain inmate population levels and payment guarantees.</p>

<p>"There's a prison-population guarantee that the State is required to have with those facilities," Hall told lawmakers on Monday. "... And to remove those potential inmates, the State would have to basically renegotiate or re-do those particular contracts whereby we're not obligated to fill those beds."</p>

<p>Additionally, Hall said that the private prisons house medium- to high-security level inmates, as well as inmates with special mental-health needs like at EMCF, while the regional facilities house state inmates considered to be low- or medium-custody. With the Legislature's criminal-justice reforms, Hall said the dynamics of the prison system will change over time.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, the low-level offenders are not going to be the ones spending those long sentences in the county jails, and that's just the nature of the beast that comes with criminal-justice reform," she said. "I think in this state we built too many prisons, and we were over-incarcerating at some point. Well, the trend has turned."</p>

<p>MDOC pays about $41.74 per inmate per day in a private prison, Hall said. At the Capitol on Monday, she said that the contract for Wilkinson County Correctional Facility is up for renewal in June this year, and she is having her staff prepare a request-for-proposal for contractors to bid on. She said she is also considering bringing the operations there back in-house.</p>

<p>The State still owes more than $217 million in bond indebtedness on private prisons, and taxpayers will pay for those bonds, including for the closed Walnut Grove, until 2027, MDOC numbers show.</p>

<p>These bond costs are in addition to the State's contractual obligations to MTC to operate the facilities and to other contractors such as Centene Corporation to provide medical care in the state's prison system.</p>

<p>County taxpayers in the 22 counties that issued bonds to open regional prisons will have to foot the bill for those facilities, however, which is why the room was tense on Monday. There are about 3,000 inmates in the state's three private prisons, while regional facilities house more than 4,000 inmates.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, it comes down to funding, and just like you all have needs and issues in your regional facilities, we have them in the Department of Corrections, too," Hall said.</p>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/apr/24/mississippi-defendants-spend-months-jail-awaiting-/ </p>

<p>A recent survey of Mississippi jails conducted by the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law shows that 2,500 defendants—more than one-third of all of those jailed before trial—have been in jail 90 or more consecutive days. More than 600 have been in jail longer than a year. Photo by Trip Burns/File Photo</p>

<p>BRANDON, Miss. (AP) — Jerry Sanders has been sitting in a jail cell on a relatively minor charge of methamphetamine possession for more than a year—longer than the sentence he could get if he's convicted.</p>

<p>And with no money to post bail or hire his own lawyer, he may be sitting there for weeks or months more.</p>

<p>"I miss my children, I miss my woman, I miss my dog, I miss my job, I miss my home — everything," Sanders, 58, said recently by videoconference from inside the Rankin County jail in Brandon.</p>

<p>Long pretrial detentions are not unheard of elsewhere in the United States. But poverty, scarce resources, and a pattern of locking up people for low-level crimes make them particularly prevalent here, in the country's poorest state.</p>

<p>A recent survey of Mississippi jails conducted by the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law—released exclusively to The Associated Press—shows that 2,500 defendants—more than one-third of all of those jailed before trial—have been in jail 90 or more consecutive days. More than 600 have been in jail longer than a year.</p>

<p>The most recent census conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2013, showed an average pretrial jail stay in Mississippi of 40 days, the sixth-longest in the country. The census also revealed that Mississippi had the second-highest number of local jail inmates per capita, behind Louisiana.</p>

<p>Cliff Johnson, who directs the Ole Miss branch of Chicago-based MacArthur, said he hopes the information will show the true extent of long pretrial jail stays in Mississippi and bolster efforts to lessen them. MacArthur has repeatedly sued cities and counties in Mississippi for jailing poor people who can't afford to pay bail or fines.</p>

<p>Data was nearly impossible to compile until last July, when the state Supreme Court, lobbied by the MacArthur center, ordered sheriff's offices to provide it.</p>

<p>The numbers reinforce what Johnson says he already knew: "Mississippi's criminal justice system, for a variety of reasons, is set up so that lengthy pretrial incarceration is not only possible, it's common."</p>

<p>Among those reasons:</p>

<p>— Most defendants in Mississippi can't afford their own lawyers or the high bails judges continue to slap on them, despite decades-old federal court rulings that they consider what a defendant can pay.</p>

<p>"They've been convicted of nothing," Johnson said. "They're presumed innocent, and I think we lose sight of that fact."</p>

<p>— Public defenders in Mississippi are overworked and underpaid. Attorneys may spend five minutes with a defendant while a judge sets bail, but defendants may not see lawyers again until after they've been indicted. A recent report slamming indigent defense called this period the "black hole" of representation. Judicial leaders plan to ask lawmakers for more funding to increase the amount of help available to poor defendants.</p>

<p>— In many rural Mississippi counties, grand juries and courts meet only twice a year. In 2012, a woman in Choctaw County was jailed for more than three months without a preliminary hearing because the court was out of session.</p>

<p>On the same day The Associated Press interviewed him, Mark Chandlee, a part-time public defender in Lauderdale County, was handling an armed-robbery plea in which the defendant had been jailed just a few months shy of two years.</p>

<p>"I don't really have much standing to get the case rolling until they're indicted," Chandlee said.</p>

<p>In January, records show, a Lauderdale County man pleaded guilty to disposing stolen property. His sentence carried no prison time, but he'd already been in jail 310 days.</p>

<p>Such long jail stays pressure people into pleading guilty, public defenders say.</p>

<p>"Spending time in a county jail, it can make guys crack," said Marvell Gordon, a public defender in Lauderdale and Yazoo counties.</p>

<p>Too poor to scrape up the $5,000 needed to cover his $50,000 bail, or to hire his own lawyer, Sanders said he's ready to plead guilty to the felony charge. He knows he's been jailed so long that he would be immediately eligible for release.</p>

<p>But Sanders' girlfriend, Kathy McGovern, said she can't even get the part-time public defender to answer her calls.</p>

<p>"Simple drug charge, why are you holding him for over a year?" she asked.</p>

<p>Lauderdale County District Attorney Bilbo Mitchell acknowledges there is a problem and says he has told his assistants "to do everything they can to speed things up."</p>

<p>Money is also a reason for delays in presenting evidence and conducting autopsies. Crime Lab Director Sam Howell says one of the state's four labs is six months behind on testing, because of a lack of analysts to verify and weigh illegal drugs. Many autopsies from last year remain incomplete because Mississippi only has two medical examiners, Howell said. After news stories about the delays, lawmakers this spring allotted money to hire four more beginning July 1.</p>

<p>And inmates who may be mentally ill face truly extraordinary delays, said Dr. Tom Recore, a forensic psychiatrist with the state Department of Mental Health.</p>

<p>"There are 15 beds for 82 counties," he said. "If that sounds like it's not a lot, your ears are not deceiving you."</p>

<p>Recore said 90 to 100 inmates statewide need evaluation at any given time, with most waiting three to four months. The wait time got shorter after more evaluators were hired and counties began using private contractors. But some of the 60 people currently awaiting treatment have been on a list for years, Recore said.</p>

<p>Under a pilot program, mental health professionals are treating inmates directly in two county jails. The state plans to expand the number of beds for prisoners, and lawmakers allotted $1 million to explore a permanent expansion of treatment facilities.</p>

<p>For Sanders, state officials can't act fast enough.</p>

<p>"I've told them I want to plead guilty to my charge," he said. "I've done lost my car, my home, my job, over some nonsense. ... I should have been home a long time ago."</p>

<h2 id="debtorsprisonsoutparoleformorepeople">Debtors’ Prisons Out, Parole For More People</h2>

<p>Starting July 1, more Mississippians behind bars will be eligible for parole after the Mississippi Legislature passed House Bill 387 and the governor approved it. Photo by MDOC</p>

<p>JACKSON — Criminal-justice reform is and has been a bipartisan issue in the Mississippi Legislature in recent years, and 2018 is no exception. Lawmakers unanimously passed House Bill 387, which had the support of conservative and progressive local and national organizations from Americans for Prosperity to the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>

<p>The legislation stops the State from running what is, in essence, a debtors' prison for Mississippians who cannot afford their fines and court fees. Judges must determine a defendant's indigence before sending him or her to prison for nonpayment of fines and fees. If a defendant's income is at or below 125 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, the judge must allow the person more time to pay, reduce the amount needed to pay the fines, or allow community service instead of fines.</p>

<p>A single person making $15,175 or less a year would be considered indigent under the new law, which goes into effect July 1. A defendant in a household of four that makes less than $31,375 annually would be considered indigent.</p>

<p>Zoe Towns is the senior director of criminal justice reform at Fwd.us, a bipartisan advocacy organization that follows immigration and criminal justice. She pointed to other lawsuits, including in municipalities in Mississippi where this practice has been deemed unconstitutional.</p>

<p>"(HB 387 is) trying to make sure that the law does not allow the practice of debtors' prisons," Towns told the Jackson Free Press. "Fees and fines and other criminal-justice payments are resulting too often in being pulled back in jail."</p>

<p>No More Stacking</p>

<p>Part of House Bill 387 ensures that the massive criminal-justice reform package the Legislature passed in 2014 has the impact it was intended to have. One part of the new law will prevent judges from stacking technical violations when a person violates the terms of probation or parole. This clarification will ensure that instead of a judge sending someone back to prison or revoking parole entirely on the first technical violation, he or she will go to a technical violation center instead.</p>

<p>Towns said this stacking issue came, in part, from a lack of clarity from the 2014 law.</p>

<p>"We expect that (change) to have a broad impact since there are such high numbers of these revocations," she said.</p>

<p>State Public Defender Andre de Gruy, who serves on the state's re-entry council, estimates that if judges adhere to this change, it could mean a savings of between $12 million to $20 million for MDOC. The logical outcome of this reform would mean fewer Mississippians getting parole or probation revoked and more of them going to a technical violation center for 90 to 180 days as state law allows. MDOC already plans to expand its technical violation center operations this spring, re-opening the Delta Correctional Center in Leflore County as a new 300-bed TVC.</p>

<p>The new reform law also loosens parole eligibility for nonviolent offenders who received enhanced sentences before 2014 (when House Bill 585 passed).</p>

<p>De Gruy estimates that about 177 people will eventually become parole-eligible under this new law, more than 140 of them on July 1. He provided numbers showing that MDOC could save $1.1 million in fiscal-year 2019.</p>

<p>One Passed, Another Vetoed</p>

<p>While Gov. Phil Bryant signed the new reform law with advocates and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers surrounding him, he quietly vetoed another reform effort. Senate Bill 2841 contained a handful of other reforms, including language to allow those in prison to keep their drivers licenses and drug courts to administer opioid drug treatment.</p>

<p>Bryant said he vetoed the bill primarily because a provision would have required MDOC to determine whether an inmate is indigent before making him or her pay parole, probation or supervision fees. Current Mississippi law requires an inmate to pay a monthly $55 fee when he or she is paroled or on probation or supervision 30 days after their release.</p>

<p>When Bryant vetoed the bill, he said MDOC risked losing "millions" of dollars due to the fact that certain inmates paying supervision fees could be deemed indigent. These fees will total an estimated $13.5 million, or about a third of MDOC's community corrections budget, in fiscal-year 2019, legislative budget office documents show.</p>

<p>MDOC estimates it would have lost as much as 75 percent in supervision fee collections in fiscal-year 2019 if SB 2841 became law. This means in the upcoming fiscal year MDOC could collect as much as $10 million in supervision fees from inmates that the legislation would have deemed unable to pay in the first place because they cannot afford it.</p>

<p>SB 2841 would have allowed inmates to be out from behind bars for 90 days before paying their first $55 fee. The bill also would have guaranteed that an inmate deemed indigent did not have parole or probation revoked because they could not pay the fee. While the reform law Bryant signed allows judges to determine whether or not someone can pay a court fine or fee, it does not cover parole or probation fees collected by MDOC in its language.</p>

<p>Download .NEWSDOCUMENTS20180425MBR-1<em>BUDGET</em>REQUEST_SUMMARY</p>

<p>Vetoing SB 2841 will continue a scenario that can go like this: If formerly imprisoned people have appointments with their probation officers, but they do not have their probation fees, they can either show up and risk a violation for nonpayment, or they do not show up because they do not have the money and get a violation for not showing up.</p>

<p>"It really cannot be overstated how mentally and emotionally draining it would be going to your appointment every month knowing that they could revoke your probation or parole that day," criminal-justice advocate Blake Feldman said. "... It really becomes a shakedown with so much on the line."</p>

<p>Rep. Joel Bomgar, R-Madison, who advocated for and supported both criminal justice reform measures during the session, said SB 2841 would have helped improve employability in the state.</p>

<p>"This bill would have helped increase employment prospects for those reentering society after an interaction with the criminal justice system. The bill restored driver's licenses to individuals, as long as their offense wasn't related to driving. This is a common-sense reform that is essential to gainful employment in a rural state like ours. The bill also included provisions to encourage work training in prisons and ensure that fees and fines don't stand as a barrier to employment for those reentering society," Bomgar said in a statement to the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Other states have supervision fees as well, Towns said, but the trends and evidence seem to be moving in the opposite direction as states begin to examine who can pay these fees and who's being punished when they cannot.</p>

<p>"The point of supervision needs to be for public safety, not debt collection," she told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Last month, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba had prepared to make an executive decision about how the Jackson Police Department would handle transparency following officer-involved shootings. There have been two deadly ones in Jackson this year alone, and the mayor fundamentally supports releasing the names of officers who shoot citizens, he says, even though the police department is against naming them.</p>

<p>But in the name of a people-oriented government, Lumumba opted to create a task force of citizens and law enforcement to develop the City's policy on how it will handle these instances in the future.</p>

<p>"[I] thought that if we were going to truly make a decision for the community, the community should be involved," the mayor said April 11 at the first officer-involved shooting identification task-force meeting.</p>

<p>Some have critiqued the mayor for choosing "bureaucracy," but Lumumba contends that this is the best way forward, entrusting that the task force will move swiftly but not at the sacrifice of being diligent and prudent.</p>

<p>The task force has the full ability to request any City documents it needs, to have officials to come and speak before them, and to determine how long the process of developing policy needs to take.</p>

<p>While this could be the first task force of this exact nature the nation has ever seen, the 21-member group has a lot to work through including getting nearly two dozen people to reach a consensus on an extremely divided issue.</p>

<p>Who's Who on the Panel?</p>

<p>Rukia Lumumba, the mayor's sister and a social and economic justice advocate, walked into the second officer ID task-force meeting with a list of suggestions on April 16, although she had missed the first meeting.</p>

<p>Most of her motions passed, including moving the meeting times, expanding public comments to at least 20 minutes and adding an additional youth member. She also suggested the group meet in more neutral spaces, as the first meeting took place in a city building across from Jackson City Hall and the second at the police academy.</p>

<p>The group tabled her suggestion of incorporating a citizen affected by an officer-involved shooting with no pending litigation.</p>

<p>The other members who join Rukia Lumumba on the task force include at least five Jackson police officers, who sit next to each other in a bloc. The task force has not yet gone into the weeds of everyone's viewpoint on releasing officers' names, but Paul Hobson, a detective with JPD and president of the Jackson Police Officer Association and member of the task force, has spoken on behalf of JPD's views recently and often in meetings.</p>

<p>"I can tell you and assure you that 100 percent of our department is against the release of officer names as it pertains to shootings," Hobson said in March.</p>

<p>The mayor and JPD Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore sat in on the first meeting to offer guidance and show support, but they are not members of the task force. With not everyone coming to both meetings, it is fuzzy as to who will remain as the core group of devoted individuals throughout this process.</p>

<p>Keyshia Sanders of constituent services for the City of Jackson and the mayor's chief of staff, Safiya Omari, represent the City as non-voting members. Former school-board member Jed Oppenheim of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation takes the minutes for the group. Kay Gex, who only came to the first meeting, is the mayor's neighbor who said she is committed to law enforcement. Nsombi Lambright, a past executive director of the ACLU of Mississippi and current director of a nonprofit called One Voice, is also on the task force. There is also Matt Bolian, a former military intelligence officer and now the channel development manager at C-Spire, and Frances Greer-Morris, who served on the City's Historic Preservation Committee.</p>

<p>Others include consultant Mike Walker; coach James Davis; Ricky Jones, a former JPS school board member; attorney Edley Jones, consultant Mike Walker and Michael Starks. Attorney C.J. Lawrence, the mayor's former law partner and close friend who created the #iftheygunnedmedown campaign following Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, is the chairman, and Jim Hill High School student Ruben Banks serves as the co-chairman of the task force.</p>

<p>The Clarion-Ledger critiqued the mayor for including a man named Terun Moore on the task force. Moore was convicted of capital murder in 2001 at the age of 17 and was sentenced to life without parole. The late Chokwe Lumumba served as his lawyer back then.</p>

<p>A Mississippi Supreme Court judge vacated Moore's sentence in 2014, citing a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that life without parole for juveniles is unconstitutional. At the City's Crime and Justice Summit on April 19, the mayor called out the Ledger for the pushback, although their reporter had left for the evening.</p>

<p>"I knowingly put a member on that board who was someone that was a 'returning citizen' because I thought that that perspective needed to be incorporated in the conversation... . I think that the perspective that does not allow for that to be added to the conversation is an elitist one," the mayor said during the discussion.</p>

<p>Time Will Tell</p>

<p>Nationally speaking, Jackson is taking a unique approach to figuring out how the City will handle police shootings in the future. This is not a citizen's review board as seen in other cities like Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta, Ga., where a group of appointed citizens review police misconduct, among other things. However, the officer ID task-force could implement a citizen's review board in the forthcoming policy.</p>

<p>What is not different is that police departments throughout the nation have been trying to decide how to deal with releasing names or withholding them in the post-Michael Brown and Ferguson era. In 2016, The Washington Post found that following the 990 lethal officer-involved shootings in 2015, one in five officers' names went undisclosed, with departments citing state laws or department-wide practices for keeping the names a secret.</p>

<p>But, there is more than just the police department feeling unsavory toward a potential release of officers' names.</p>

<p>Adofo Minka, a criminal defense attorney who used to work with the mayor in the early days of both men's legal career, interrupted and effectively brought the first task-force meeting to a close. He wanted community members to be able to speak and brought a list of 15 questions he wanted to raise before the task force. As he sat with the wife and sister of Lee Edward Bonner, whom JPD shot and killed in February, he demanded to know why nobody from a victim's family was appointed to the task force.</p>

<p>When Minka got up toward the end of the meeting and passed out the list of questions to the task-force members, Omari asked him to stop.</p>

<p>"This is a public meeting, ma'am," Minka said to Omari.</p>

<p>"This is a meeting of this task force, the public is invited...," Omari responded before motioning to adjourn.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Bonner family walked out in tears after not being given a chance to speak, as tensions rose between Minka and Omari.</p>

<p>With Rukia Lumumba's motion a week later to include an impacted family member still out on the floor, a family like the Bonners may be included in the future, but only time will tell.</p>

<p>Bipartisan criminal-justice reform is something to sing about, and we applaud the Mississippi Legislature and the governor for passing and signing House Bill 387 into law this session. The measure follows a trend of steady reforms intended to keep nonviolent inmates from serving long sentences and enable them to come back to society.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Legislature passed House Bill 585, which began the wave of reforms, as the State of Mississippi realized savings in corrections costs and judges began to adjust their sentencing habits. What is missing from these discussions, particularly at the Legislature, however, is how the State and counties will pay off their bonds, issued back in the 1990s and early 2000s to build more prisons.</p>

<p>Criminal-justice reform means decreasing reliance on incarceration, which means less money from locking people up. The sheriffs in 22 counties that operate regional jails understand this firsthand and went to the Capitol this week to say so. The majority of those counties are losing funds, while still paying off prison bonds they issued years ago.</p>

<p>Similarly, the State of Mississippi, despite closing the privately run Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in 2016, will be paying for the prison until 2027. These costs need to be at the heart of criminal-justice reform conversations, as well as repairing conditions. As savings are realized in the Mississippi Department of Corrections, justice reinvestment is crucial in helping the state and counties counter their lost revenue with fewer inmates to lock up.</p>

<p>The State cannot idly stand by and shrug as MDOC and local counties lose funding—and eventually jobs—due to a shrinking prison population. It is time to be innovative and evaluate how re-entry and employment programs can help Mississippi communities provide jobs for local people and second chances for those coming out of the prison system.</p>

<p>State leaders must start using basic math and smart planning when it comes to long-term spending on prisons. The State must choose Mississippians over running these facilities as taxpayer-funded enterprises that exist to benefit private prison corporations.</p>

<p>The City of Corinth agreed to settle a lawsuit alleging that the city ran a debtors' prison, locking up men and women before they saw a judge for not paying their fines and fees. Photo by Zeakky/File Illustration</p>

<p>JACKSON — The City of Corinth will stop locking up men and women who cannot afford to pay their fines or bail after reaching an agreement with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the MacArthur Justice Center.</p>

<p>The federal judge needs to approve the plan, but both parties filed an agreement late Wednesday. In December, SPLC and MacArthur sued Corinth on behalf of Sammy Brown and Brian Howell. Howell was unemployed but fined $1,000 for three traffic violations. Municipal Court Judge John C. Ross assessed the $1,000 fine, and Howell had to pay his fine in full or sit in jail at a rate of $25 a day, the lawsuit says.</p>

<p>Brown, charged with public drunkenness in December, had to stay in jail because he could not afford his $600 bond. He does not have a job.</p>

<p>The court and plaintiffs entered an interim agreement in late December, but that agreement did not mean the Corinth Municipal Court and Judge Ross have admitted liability in the case, however.</p>

<p>The proposed settlement agreement ensures that defendants arrested without warrants see a judge within 48 hours, and that the municipal court cannot jail those men and women who cannot afford to pay their fines or bail. Defendants can choose between a $25-a-month payment plan or community service instead of staying in jail, the agreement says.</p>

<p>The settlement agreement sets up a detailed plan for the City of Corinth, which is in line with criminal-justice reforms that take affect statewide on July 1. Judges must determine a defendant's indigence before sending him or her to prison for nonpayment of fines and fees once House Bill 387 becomes state law.</p>

<p>The City of Corinth has also agreed to train all employees whom the new agreement affects.</p>

<p>"The proposed settlement will ensure that the Corinth Municipal Court stays focused on justice and fairness, and eliminates a two-tiered system of justice that previously punished people simply because they were poor. Now, everyone should be treated fairly," Sam Brooke, deputy legal director for the SPLC, said in a press release.</p>

<p>The settlement agreement in Corinth is in line with the new court rules that the Mississippi Supreme Court issued last year that direct judges to follow certain steps when a defendant cannot afford to pay their fines and fees.</p>

<p>"Everyone arrested in Mississippi must be taken before a judge within 48 hours, and except in very rare cases, the law requires that they be released at that first appearance on conditions that do not include buying their way out of jail by giving money to a bail bondsman," Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law, said in a press release.</p>

<p>"Many Mississippi judges continue to impose money bail in every criminal case they handle despite the fact that they have been reminded again and again to stop using bail improperly. Some judges are getting the message, but many are not," he continued. "Those defiant judges who misuse bail are filling our local jails with poor people and costing local taxpayers a huge amount of money in incarceration expenses."</p>

<p>JACKSON — Big House Books, a nonprofit that sends free books by request to inmates, filed a lawsuit against the South Mississippi Correctional Institution this week because inmates there cannot receive books that are donated, the lawsuit says.</p>

<p>"That prison permits inmates to receive books through the mail only if the books have been purchased or if the books are religious. Inmates are not permitted to receive free, non-religious books by mail," the complaint says.</p>

<p>"... The only way to receive secular books through the mail is if the prisoner, family member, or other sender pays for them."</p>

<p>The Mississippi Center for Justice filed the lawsuit in federal court, alleging that the policy to allow inmates to have some books but not donated ones, violates inmates' First and 14th Amendment rights. The complaints asks the court to issue an injunction against the Mississippi Department of Corrections policy cited to inmates about why they cannot receive books from Big House Books.</p>

<p>Two inmates, Charles Owens and Jess Green, at SMCI were told that they could not receive free books from Big House Books due to a certain MDOC policy. Even after filing complaints and formal remedy forms, both Owens and Green were told they could not receive free books unless they were religious.</p>

<p>"The restriction discriminates against inmates like Mr. Owens and Mr. Green who sometimes wish to read donated, non-religious books," the lawsuit says. "The restriction discriminates on the basis of religious content and limits prisoners' access to donated, non-religious books without any justification."</p>

<p>Beth Orlansky, advocacy director at the Mississippi Center for Justice, said that there are similar problems with inmates receiving books from Big House Books at Parchman, too. She said her organization wrote a letter to MDOC asking for the rationale behind the policy change.</p>

<p>"We got a very unsatisfactory answer that didn't really give a good explanation," Orlansky said, leading to the center's decision to file the lawsuit.</p>

<p>MDOC does not comment on active litigation, and the department had not filed a response in the court record at press time.</p>

<h2 id="governorvetoesopioidcrimereformsaftersigningreentrylaw">Governor Vetoes Opioid, Crime Reforms After Signing Reentry Law</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-19</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant signed one criminal justice reform measure but vetoed another, citing millions of dollars of lost revenue for the Mississippi Department of Corrections if they cannot fine Mississippians on parole or probation who are at 125 percent or below the federal poverty line.

<p>Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Gov. Phil Bryant has blocked an effort to help wean those addicted to opioids off the drugs with medication, as well as assist indigent prisoners. SB 2841, which he vetoed on April 13 citing financial concerns at the Mississippi Department of Corrections, would have enabled drug courts to make medication available to addicts.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 2841 also would have required MDOC to determine the indigence of Mississippians on parole, probation or supervision before assessing monthly community corrections fees. The governor took issue with this part of the bill.</p>

<p>"This bill replaces the discretion of the court or department to grant a hardship waiver to an offender with a statutorily mandated 'determination of indigence' based on Federal Poverty Guidelines. The department estimates that this change in the law could cost millions of dollars annually," he wrote in his veto message.</p>

<p>If the governor's message is correct, it follows that MDOC is bringing in millions of dollars to the Community Service Revolving Fund from Mississippians on probation or parole, who are at or below the federal poverty line currently.</p>

<p>Current state law allows the department to grant a hardship waiver if a person on parole, probation or supervision cannot pay their $55-per-month fee. The sentencing court or MDOC can give out a hardship waiver, but the waiver cannot last past 90 days. Bryant said the current hardship waiver process "has worked."</p>

<p>The Mississippi Department of Corrections had a statement pending at press time, and this story will be updated once it releases it.</p>

<p>Two days before the veto, Bryant signed another criminal-justice reform bill. House Bill 387 extends parole eligibility and judicial discretion for Mississippians considered "habitual offenders" under state law as well as orders judges to determine whether or not a person can afford their court fees or fines before sending them back to jail or prison for not paying.</p>

<p>The law, which Bryant vetoed last year, had support from progressive and conservative groups, including Americans for Prosperity and Fwd.us. The governor signed the bill surrounded by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers and advocates, Democrats and Republicans. House Bill 387 also creates the Mississippi Sentencing Disparity Taskforce to study how Mississippians are sentenced differently for the same crime from county to county.</p>

<p>"A critical piece of this legislation going forward—one that will be monitored closely—is the effective administration of expanded data collection efforts within the criminal justice system," Jody Owens, managing attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a press release. "Gathering more relevant data on the children who are housed in juvenile detention centers, as well as in county and municipal jails in Mississippi, will provide the state with the starting point it needs to bring additional reforms to the juvenile justice system that will allow it to rehabilitate, not punish, Mississippi's children."</p>

<p>Russ Latino, the state director of Americans for Prosperity, commended the governor for signing House Bill 387 in a statement on April 11.</p>

<p>"HB 387 will reduce the burden on taxpayers, focus precious resources on criminal activity that represents a real threat to the public, and provide people with a second chance to contribute to their families and communities after prison," Latino said in a press release. "This bill and its counterpart, SB 2841, are proof that people from all backgrounds and persuasions can come together to make a difference."</p>

<p>Bryant addressed his embrace of HB 387 while vetoing the second bill in his veto message. "During my administration, we have made good criminal justice reforms, including House Bill 387 that I signed this year," Bryant wrote, saying he supports removing mandatory suspensions of driver's licenses for controlled-substance violations. "... However, I cannot force the Department of Corrections to potentially suffer the loss of millions of dollars, particularly in light of the department's operational budget being cut for fiscal year 2019 by legislative appropriation."</p>

<p>Rep. Joel Bomgar, R-Madison, supported SB 2841 because it would have improved employability, he says.</p>

<p>"This bill would have helped increase employment prospects for those reentering society after an interaction with the criminal justice system. The bill restored driver's licenses to individuals, as long as their offense wasn't related to driving. This is a common-sense reform that is essential to gainful employment in a rural state like ours," Bomgar said in an emailed statement. "The bill also included provisions to encourage work training in prisons and ensure that fees and fines don't stand as a barrier to employment for those reentering society. I was disappointed that the bill did not become law this year, but I am optimistic that the legislature will continue to work on these issues going forward to improve our state's economy."</p>

<p>Correction: A previous version of this story defined the federal poverty guidelines as at or above the federal poverty line, when it should have said "at or below." We apologize for the error. </p>

<p>JACKSON — Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the City of Jackson will host a Crime and Justice Summit tonight at 6 p.m. at the Jackson Convention Complex downtown. While the mayor has made a couple announcements about the summit at public events, including Jackson City Council meetings, scarce details are available about structure and subject matter.</p>

<p>"The summit will address important issues and concerns centering on crime and justice in the capital city. City officials and representatives from the Jackson Police Department will be in attendance," reads a press release about the event.</p>

<p>With so many crime initiatives and issues taking place in the City of Jackson, one has to imagine there are a host of directions this event could go. In a recent interview with the Jackson Free Press, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore confirmed 26 homicides in Jackson in 2018 as of April 11—an average of 6.5 homicides per month.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>There have been at least seven officer-involved shootings since Mayor Lumumba took office, and the City is trying to address that currently. Although the mayor himself supports releasing the names of officers who have shot people on the job, last month he signed an executive order implementing a task force to decide the future policy on if/when officers who shoot people will be identified. Jackson has a longstanding practice of shielding officers' names in these situations and, perhaps, has never willingly released names.</p>

<p>JPD is also facing criticism over the controversial U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions-backed initiative, Project EJECT (Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together). U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst announced the initiative in December, and since then his office has been working "hand in glove" with the Jackson Police Department, he says, to identify which Jacksonians qualify to be prosecuted in the federal system that has no parole and has a much higher propensity for sending those convicted to far away prisons—ejecting them, as Hurst would say.</p>

<p>More recently this JPD-federal partnership has taken the form of gang sweeps with the Monday announcement of 45 arrests, 75 percent of whom were alleged gang members, Hurst said. He would not provide names, however.</p>

<p>Local, state and federal law enforcement also rounded up sex offenders and those with existing warrants, some of whom were found with drugs. There are no details available about arrestees as of yet, but Hurst said it is likely that some of them will fall under Project EJECT. Thirty-five people have been indicted under Project EJECT as of February, with 40 percent of them being charged as felons in possession of a weapon.</p>

<p>Lumumba has distanced himself from Project EJECT, saying at a city council meeting in February that it is not "and never has been an initiative of the City."</p>

<p>Hurst has made it clear to the Jackson Free Press that this violent-crime fighting strategy has been designed strictly for Jackson at the moment, despite reported surges of gang activities on the Gulf Coast and other parts of the state.</p>

<h2 id="supremecourtstrikesdownasvaguepartofimmigrationlaw">Supreme Court Strikes Down as Vague Part of Immigration Law</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-17</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/apr/17/supreme-court-strikes-down-vague-part-immigration-/ </p>

<p>The Supreme Court said Tuesday that part of a federal law that makes it easier to deport immigrants who have been convicted of crimes is too vague to be enforced. Photo by Photo courtesy Flickr/NCinDC</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Tuesday that part of a federal law that makes it easier to deport immigrants who have been convicted of crimes is too vague to be enforced.</p>

<p>The court's 5-4 decision — an unusual alignment in which new Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the four liberal justices — concerns a catchall provision of immigration law that defines what makes a crime violent. Conviction for a crime of violence makes deportation "a virtual certainty" for an immigrant, no matter how long he has lived in the United States, Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her opinion for the court.</p>

<p>The decision is a loss for President Donald Trump's administration, which has emphasized stricter enforcement of immigration law. In this case, President Barack Obama's administration took the same position in the Supreme Court in defense of the challenged provision.</p>

<p>With the four other conservative justices in dissent, it was the vote of the Trump appointee that was decisive in striking down the provision at issue. Gorsuch did not join all of Kagan's opinion, but he agreed with her that the law could not be left in place. Gorsuch wrote that "no one should be surprised that the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague that reasonable people cannot understand its terms and judges do not know where to begin in applying it."</p>

<p>The case turned on a decision from 2015 that struck down a similarly worded part of another federal law that imposes longer prison sentences on repeat criminals. The majority opinion in that case was one of the last written by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016 and whose seat Gorsuch filled.</p>

<p>The 2015 decision "tells us how to resolve this case," Kagan wrote.</p>

<p>Tuesday's decision involves James Dimaya, a native of the Philippines who came to the United States legally as a 13-year-old in 1992. After he pleaded no contest to two charges of burglary in California, the government began deportation proceedings against him. The government argued among other things that he could be removed from the country because his convictions qualified as crimes of violence that allowed his removal under immigration law.</p>

<p>Immigration officials relied on a section of immigration law that lists crimes that make people eligible for deportation. The category in which Dimaya's convictions fell is a crime "that, by its very nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force...may be used in the course of committing the offense."</p>

<p>Immigration judges would have allowed Dimaya to be deported, but the federal appeals court in San Francisco struck down the provision as unconstitutionally vague. The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling Tuesday.</p>

<p>The decision does not interfere with the government's ability to deport people who are convicted of clearly violent crimes, including murder and rape, as well as drug trafficking and other serious offenses. The ruling is limited to a category of crimes that carry a prison term of more than a year, but do not otherwise comfortably fit in a long list of "aggravated felonies" that can lead to deportation.</p>

<p>The case was initially argued in January 2017 by a court that was short a member because of Scalia's death and the refusal of Senate Republicans to act on Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. Deadlocked 4-4, the justices scheduled a new round of arguments once Gorsuch joined the court.</p>

<p>The case is Sessions v. Dimaya, 15-1498.</p>

<p>JACKSON — U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst called a press conference at the United States Courthouse downtown Monday to release some details about the results of a recent cooperative sting to go after a mix of alleged criminals with outstanding warrants, gang members and their associates, and sex offenders. He said other agencies will likely refer some of them to his office for prosecution under his controversial crime-fighting initiative Project EJECT—Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together—under which Hurst pledges to go after the "worst of the worst."</p>

<p>"[T]his is what Project EJECT is all about: increased cooperation among our law enforcement to take the worst of the worst off our streets and the empowerment of our citizens and our communities through education, awareness, and assistance," he said Monday.</p>

<p>Last week, a "surge" of law enforcement took place in Jackson to sweep up a variety of suspects, whom Hurst declined to name. The U.S. Marshals Service's Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force led the arrests sweep, with members from the Jackson Police Department, Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, Mississippi Bureau of Investigations, Mississippi Department of Corrections, Pearl Police Department, Homeland Security Investigations, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives, Ridgeland Police Department, Biloxi Police Department, the Metro 1 Air Support, and sheriff's departments from Hinds, Madison and Rankin counties.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>Task-force members arrested 45 individuals of various races, almost 75 percent of whom were identified as gang members, including Gangster Disciples, Vice Lords, Simon City Royals, Latin Kings and Aryan Brotherhood, Hurst said. The task force "substantially increased" its numbers of officers up to 60 for last week's bust, and that kind of cooperation among law enforcement, Hurst said, allows them to dismantle gangs, prosecute violent criminals and remove sex offenders from the capital city.</p>

<p>"[B]ecause of the actions taken last week, the City of Jackson and the surrounding areas today are safer and more secure," Hurst said.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions praised the action in a statement emailed to local media. "When law enforcement officers work together, we get results,” Sessions said. “The arrest of more than 30 gang members in Jackson is the result of effective collaboration between all levels of law enforcement—federal, state and local—to target the most violent criminals in our communities."</p>

<p>Sessions' approach to crime-fighting draws much criticism, however, including from David Kennedy, a criminologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, who called the AG's "evidence-free strategy ... a criminologist's nightmare." That despite Hurst telling the Jackson Free Press that Project Eject is modeled on the Kennedy-led Boston Gun Project and Operation Ceasefire violence strategies.</p>

<p>"Sessions has called for a return to the 'war on drugs' menu—more law enforcement, mandatory minimums and long sentences, even the anti-drug D.A.R.E. program—plus a new focus on heavy immigration enforcement and a withdrawal from DOJ attention to police misconduct. But we now know for a fact that these things don’t work, and can actually make matters worse," Kennedy wrote in an essay for The Hill.</p>

<p>Hurst said it is important to identify gang members if his office is going to make any headway on "breaking gangs" so they can go up the ladder and get the leaders. "It's only by getting the gang members and getting the gang leaders that we're able to break the gang' themselves," Hurst said.</p>

<p>Many violence experts, however, say that it is unwise for law enforcement to fixate on gang membership over investigating and prosecuting specific crimes. "If I say you're a gangster and that you're talking to gangsters, then you're a gangster. ... It is the standard way that law enforcement will try to deal with a problem that cannot be dealt with with force," Ron Noblet, who trains law enforcement around the country in effective gang intervention and consults with the Urban Peace Institute in Los Angeles, Calif., told the Jackson Free Press. Noblet was also the lead investigator on a State-funded 2016 study of gangs and youth crime in Jackson and is a featured character in the book, "Blue: The LAPD and the Battle to Redeem American Policing," for his role in reducing gang violence there.</p>

<p>In addition, violence experts warn that suddenly disrupting, or "splintering," a gang by arresting a leader can create a leadership vacuum and increase the chance for violence as members jostle for power.</p>

<p>The details of the arrestees in last week's operation have not yet been made public, so it is not clear whether or not the gang members arrested were leaders, low-ranking members or active gang members.</p>

<p>Hurst said the task force seized a number of firearms and found illegal drugs including ecstasy, marijuana and crystal methamphetamine.</p>

<p>How Mississippi pursues people believed to be in gangs.</p>

<p>Officers identified targeted gang members through word-of-mouth and tattooed insignia, Hurst said at the press conference, but he would not divulge further details about how they decided who was in a gang or on the round-up list. The U.S. attorney diverted a question from a reporter about whether or not there has been a surge in gang activity in Jackson, pointing instead to a surge in law enforcement. He added an oft-quoted and unsupported statement by law enforcement—that some people deny that there is a gang issue in the state.</p>

<p>"But I think, not only the arrest, but the engagement with various gang members this week show that we have a gang problem not only in Jackson, but I think you'll start to see this around the state, unfortunately," Hurst said.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Legislature recently declined, for the second year in a row, to pass an expanded gang law in the state to make it easier for prosecute and attach additional sentences due to gang membership.</p>

<p>The U.S. attorney told the Jackson Free Press earlier this year that he does not have a plan to do a Project Eject-type operation outside Jackson, including on the Gulf Coast, which has seen a surge of gang-related activity and violence over the last decade. The JFP reported recently that the state's existing gang law was only used against African Americans from 2010 until 2017, even as the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators told The Clarion-Ledger last fall that 53 percent of the state's verified gang members are white.</p>

<p>Project EJECT is part of Project Safe Neighborhoods, a national strategy revived by Sessions that is known for targeting mostly African Americans in U.S. cities for possessing illegal weapons. The idea is to subject people picked up for federal gun crimes to expanded sentences and "eject" them into federal prisons far from their home state—a strategy that experts such as Kennedy, the criminologist behind Operation Ceasefire, say targets street-level people of color over the suppliers of the weapons and does not, in fact, make communities safer over time.</p>

<p>Sessions, though, is a fan of the massive-arrest approach behind both Project EJECT and Project Safe Neighborhoods. "It’s also an example of how customizing our strategy at the local level through the Project Safe Neighborhoods program helps us use our resources more effectively," he said in the statement.</p>

<p>Hurst said the task force is also rounding up sex offenders, weapons or not, because they're the "worst of the worst" and would not necessarily have to be charged with a gun crime. As of February, all people indicted under Project EJECT had been accused of a crime involving a gun from felons in possession of a weapon to armed robbery.</p>

<p>"I know there's been some misconceptions about the only crimes that fall under Project EJECT are guns, and that's actually not accurate—we're going after violent criminals. And those criminals can be violent without guns so we're prosecuting whatever tools we have in the federal system we're going after the violent offenders in our community," Hurst said, veering from the original Project Safe Neighborhoods mission and design into crimes that are typically in the jurisdiction of local, not federal, authorities.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department's involvement in Project EJECT, in Hurst's eyes, is a "match made in heaven." The Project EJECT Task Force works "hand in glove" with his office, he said, and either JPD will call his office when they think something qualifies for federal charges or vice versa.</p>

<p>"Again, I can't say enough good things about (Interim Chief Anthony Moore) and his department and what they've meant to this project and how successful it's been so far," Hurst said.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has distanced himself from Project EJECT, however. "Project EJECT is (not) and has never been an initiative of the City," Lumumba said at a recent Jackson City Council meeting that drew heated pushback on the City's role in Project EJECT. "... This administration has never said it is in favor of Project EJECT, we have never made any comments on Project EJECT. In my opinion, it may be out of our sphere of influence. What our police department is tasked with doing is investigating cases."</p>

<p>Hurst said more details will be available soon about the promised prevention, the reentry and the awareness aspects of Project EJECT.</p>

<h2 id="opinionthemayorstaskfarce">OPINION: The Mayor’s Task Farce</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adofo Minka</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-18</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/apr/18/opinion-mayors-task-farce/ </p>

<p>In his latest attempt to provide a smoke screen for violent cops, Lumumba has created a task force through executive order to deliberate over the question of whether the City should release the names of police officers involved in acts of violence against civilians. Photo by William H. Kelly III.</p>

<p>In the "most radical city on the planet," the "emperor" has no clothes. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has repeatedly provided cover for the Jackson Police Department, which has consistently exacted violence on residents. He allows JPD to operate with impunity in the face of calls from community members to hold officers accountable for their actions.</p>

<p>In his latest attempt to provide a smoke screen for violent cops, Lumumba has created a task force through executive order to deliberate over the question of whether the City should release the names of police officers involved in acts of violence against civilians. The task force is comprised of government bureaucrats, police officers, Lumumba family members and professionals who will likely never have the types of experiences that poor and working-class black people have with JPD.</p>

<p>His campaign slogan, "when I become mayor, you become mayor," speaks to a governing process that allows residents to have democratic control over the decisions that impact their lives. However, the task force's creation is mayor-centered and does not represent direct democracy.</p>

<p>At the first meeting on April 11, it was evident from the start that JPD would dominate it. Officers who were not a part of the task force spoke at will. However, community members were told they would not be allowed to address the task force.</p>

<p>Eventually, after residents pressed them about the undemocratic nature of the process, members relented and voted to offer residents 10 minutes to speak toward the end of each meeting. The task force also adopted the suggestion of a non-member officer to host the second meeting at JPD training headquarters. Apparently, no one on the task force thought it would be problematic to invite residents to a meeting space that the department controls to discuss matters critical of JPD.</p>

<p>Mayor Lumumba has said that the task force represents the will and voice of the people. During the second meeting, this well-dressed lie was exposed. Previously, the mayor said that he established the task force because certain community members did not want him to release the identities of officers. Task-force appointee and Lumumba administration Chief of Staff Safiyah Omari revealed that the committee came about as a result of a compromise between Lumumba and JPD.</p>

<p>He could have issued an executive order mandating the names of officers involved in violence against civilians be released without the smoke screen of a task force. However, he won't because it is not politically expedient for him to do so. When task-force members discussed expanding the scope of the committee, Omari told them that they would have to get the approval of the mayor because his executive order would not allow them to do that. But if we are all "co-mayors," shouldn't the people be able to decide the scope and direction of the task force?</p>

<p>Lumumba and his political allies say that "the people" must decide. Who are the people? How do "the people" decide? It appears that his desire to follow the will of the people has been relegated to the realm of theory. His practice is to appoint individuals who are loyal to his political interests. This is the type of nepotism and cronyism that breeds political corruption and opportunism.</p>

<p>This is the status quo. This is not the "radical" change that he promised to the residents of Jackson. The task force is a farce and cruel jest in the face of very serious calls for the imposition of transparency and accountability on a murderous and violent police state.</p>

<h2 id="editorsnotetimeformississippitogetsmarteroncrime">EDITOR'S NOTE: Time for Mississippi to Get Smarter on Crime</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-17</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/apr/18/editors-note-time-mississippi-get-smarter-crime/ </p>

<p>Within a week of my reports in the JFP and The Guardian about that glaring disparity going viral, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst had assembled heavily armed members of 15 agencies to swarm Jackson decidedly looking for gang members of all hues. Photo by</p>

<p>Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Dozens of officers from 15 federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies gathered in a circle in front of the new colorful Jackson mural facing State Street meant to symbolize a better capital city. The Clarion-Ledger's cops reporter was invited to join the nighttime gang hunters with her video camera.</p>

<p>The videos the reporter later posted may not have included interviews of family members of the 45 people arrested that night, or with the man whose face she filmed pressed to a porch with a cop sitting on top of it, or with violence and gang experts around the country who would tell her, and local cops and political leaders here if they asked, that this "surge" is exactly the wrong way to go about making our communities safer.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Donald Trump adore these kinds of old-school arrest sweeps, especially when used against people of color—which they usually are in America, even in states that have high numbers of white gang members and other criminals.</p>

<p>I reported recently that from 2010 to 2017, only African Americans (97 of them) were prosecuted under the state's existing gang law, even as the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators is hawking the growth of white gangs over the last decade, telling the Ledger that 53 percent of the state's verified gang members are white.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>If that is true—and it could be considering the growth of Simon City Royals, Aryan Brotherhood, Latin Kings (many are white, I'm told), biker gangs like the Bandidos and others—it means that the gang hunters are still targeting a lot of black people. Within a week of my reports in the JFP and The Guardian about that glaring disparity going viral, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst had assembled heavily armed members of 15 agencies to swarm Jackson decidedly looking for gang members of all hues.</p>

<p>In his press conference, Hurst made a point to mention the Royals, the ABs and other white gang members rounded up in Jackson, and the Ledger cops reporter was sure to include images of white people arrested in her PR videos for the raid that really could be used as warrior cop recruitment. She even showed an officer in Army green with an AR-15 patch on his shoulder, holding a mugshot of a white suspect.</p>

<p>We got it. White arrests, too. Check.</p>

<p>How Mississippi pursues people believed to be in gangs.</p>

<p>But don't let all the posturing obscure the key point. This should not be a race to round up and film more white gang members just to prove law enforcement aren't racist (and it doesn't prove that anyway). Bad policing is bad policing even if you throw more white mugshots on the pile.</p>

<p>These sweeps are bad policing for everybody, just like cops high-speed-chasing shoplifters and killing bystanders, or firing into moving vehicles instead of getting out of the way. ("Move!" an NYPD captain told me is the response to a moving car.)</p>

<p>It's a fallacy to believe a traditionally racist-plus-bad policy is suddenly a smart one or no longer racist just because officials apply them to more white people. No, that just means more whites are victims of the practices that actually make them more likely to commit worse crimes.</p>

<p>This embrace of debunked practices is where it's really time to challenge law enforcement in Mississippi. This is not the wild, wild west anymore, and law enforcement aren't hired to be warriors in the OK Corral with AR-15 patches and he-man slogans like, "Certainly there is no hunting of man like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never really care for anything else thereafter." That, by the way, was an Ernest Hemingway quote the infamous Street Crimes Unit in New York City had printed on T-shirts to inspire them when they went prowling the streets at night there.</p>

<p>What they found was Amadou Diallo smoking in his front yard, whom they shot 41 times because he had a wallet in his hand. Then, the hunters were acquitted.</p>

<p>Much is written about the "warrior" mindset in policing. Sometimes, such as with Diallo's killers, it's hard to know which side of the gang fight is the most violent. And that should not ever be the case with the ones professing to be the good guys.</p>

<p>What good cops, and their leaders, do is constantly welcome new information about what works and what doesn't. Study. Train. Retrain. Question practices. It's the same thing I've done both in the craft of journalism, and it's the same thing I do to know what I know about crime policies. I read long evidence-based reports, talk to the best criminologists and crime researchers in the country, visit cities that are instituting smart policing strategies designed to prevent crime and not increase recidivism and grow gangs by packing more young people into violent prisons without trying to rehabilitate them first.</p>

<p>Those practices are antiquated policing that continue cycles of violence. And it's often done because a) no one has bothered to know any better (and that includes cops reporters) and b) they are doing it for the wrong reasons—votes, racism, meanness, feigned toughness, playing with artillery.</p>

<p>Mississippi has always been stubborn about seeking or letting in new information. David Kennedy and colleagues designed Operation Ceasefire, which Hurst told me is a model for Project EJECT. Kennedy scoffed at that in a later interview. Kennedy also told me he had evolved much about his model since the early Boston Gun Project, because he embraced feedback, data and research on what works for violence reduction and community trust, and what does not. (Hurst also mentioned the Boston project as a model for Project EJECT, which Kennedy roundly disputes.)</p>

<p>Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, openly conflates criticism of the expanded gang law he sponsored with saying "gangs do not exist."</p>

<p>What doesn't work is rounding up people, squishing their faces into a porch or the pavement for the cameras, and then packing them into prisons across the country, per Kennedy and every top crime researcher in the country right now. Sessions may be salivating to re-ignite the mass-incarceration wave, but all of us will pay for that serious mistake here at home. Think about it this way: The need for re-entry programs wouldn't be so urgent if many people weren't coming out of prison hellholes ripe to commit more crime.</p>

<p>Oh, and let's put this straw man to rest. Even if Hurst, along with Sen. Brice Wiggins and the Ledger's cops reporter keep proclaiming that phantoms out here are saying that "gangs do not exist in Mississippi," no one with a brain is saying that. What we are saying, if they will actually listen, is that they are hawking the very strategies that will make gangs, and violent crime, worse and our state much less safe. This must stop.</p>

<h2 id="readytoengagethejfpinterviewwithjpdchiefanthonymoore">Ready to Engage: The JFP Interview with JPD Chief Anthony Moore</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-18</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/apr/18/ready-engage-jfp-interview-jpd-chief-anthony-moore/ </p>

<p>In his office on April 11, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore of the Jackson Police Department shared his hopes and concerns for the City. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore, known since Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba appointed him in January as a man of few words, opened the door to his office in the Jackson Police Department on April 11. He was cheerful and ready to engage.</p>

<p>The chief only declined to answer one question—about his views of the newly formed officer-involved-shooting identification task force the mayor authorized last month. The first meeting would be just a couple hours after the interview, and he wanted to defer to it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Moore went into the weeds of federal partnerships, his hopes to secure funding for tasers and body cameras ,and the realities of being a police officer in the capital city of Mississippi.</p>

<p>There are new things in place under Moore, including a downtown foot-patrol unit, the Project EJECT partnership with the U.S. Attorney's office and other federal entities, and an in-house Hinds County assistant district attorney.</p>

<p>Moore and the mayor have also halted "perp walks," where media request that a suspect in custody be paraded before them for photos and camera footage. JPD is no longer sending out mugshots of juveniles charged as adults or anyone shot by an officer in order to avoid implying criminality at the point of arrest.</p>

<p>With 34 years of experience with JPD, Moore knows the ins and outs of the department he inherited, one with low officer numbers and under scrutiny for its use-of-force policy that dates back to 2004 and does not include identification of any officer who shoots a civilian.</p>

<p>Since Moore took over as chief from former Chief Lee Vance in January, JPD officers have killed two people.</p>

<p>Moore also brings an academic background in criminal justice, and he hopes to use all of his tools to rewrite the use-of-force policy, keep morale high in the police department, and keep people safe in Jackson, which has seen an average of 6.5 homicides a month in 2018 as of April 11. The interim chief spoke to the Jackson Free Press in his office in police headquarters.</p>

<p>How have your first months as chief been?</p>

<p>It's been challenging. Of course being a new chief, obviously, you're going to experience various issues and things you have to deal with. But I can say that we're moving forward with a lot of things I'm trying to implement. Obviously, our manpower is a major issue right now. And so we're addressing that, trying to get our recruit class started. We anticipate on getting this class started, hopefully, at the end of May or either mid-June. That's our wish right now.</p>

<p>So, we're still in the process of trying to get 50 recruits for this particular class. We don't know if we're going to get that many, but we're hopeful. ... I'm also trying to implement a career-development plan to retain officers and recruit officers, and we think that is extremely important, along with benefits for officers—it's (also) about retaining officers.</p>

<p>Right now, we're at 351 officers—extremely short. I can remember when we were at 525 officers here at the police department. Currently we're budgeted for 418. But, we hope to increase those numbers, and we also hope to have continuous classes after this first class. We want to get our numbers back up over 500. That's the goal right now. But, this is as low as I have ever seen it since I've been employed at the police department.</p>

<p>What can you do with a fuller police force that you cannot do now?</p>

<p>I think it's going to help us in our efforts of being proactive. ... Obviously, when you're proactive, you deter crime.</p>

<p>So having a lot more manpower is going to help us be more efficient in our delivery of services to the citizens of Jackson, and I think that's a key component when it comes to community policing in our efforts.</p>

<p>Do you hope to replicate the new downtown foot-patrol unit elsewhere in the city?</p>

<p>I haven't looked at it as far as implementing it in other parts of the City as of yet. I think it's extremely important to have a presence in the downtown area. A lot of cities have downtown walking beats, and I know at one time we've had it here. Not only that, we don't just want to have a walking beat, but we want to implement a bike patrol along with a Segway patrol.</p>

<p>We've gotten positive feedback about our officers walking downtown, being visible, communicating with a lot of the businesses downtown. I know it's only been a week or so, but so far I think it's been very successful, and it's been met with a lot of praise. So we want to continue to do that also. I think that's extremely important in developing that bond and that collaboration with the business owners and the citizens downtown.</p>

<p>Is it hard to hire for police departments in general, or is this a Jackson-specific issue?</p>

<p>Ko, you know, I think it's a combination of both. I think you're dealing with a different breed of millennials, so to speak. I think there are a number of factors. The law-enforcement profession is a tough profession, and I don't know if a lot of people are more dedicated, more or less, as to coming into the profession.</p>

<p>You also have to look at the benefits associated with it, too. So, I think it's a combination of both. We've got to also look at the fact that we're in competition with other agencies. When you look at places like Memphis, Atlanta, Dallas, when we have to compete with those agencies, those are extremely hard things to do. But we're doing everything we can to try to attract as many officers as we can to beef up our force.</p>

<p>With the Jackson residency requirement lifted, do you still hope the core of the force will be from the community?</p>

<p>Well, yes. I think so, but again, a lot of times you have to be able to attract quality candidates, and my concern is if you can come to work, be here on time, serve the citizens of Jackson.</p>

<p>How do you deal with violent crime in Jackson?</p>

<p>Homicide is an issue in the city of Jackson. We stand at 26 homicides as of right now (for this year). They occur for various reasons, everything from domestic disputes, arguments between individuals, (and) there have been a few cases of robberies-—some that we're still trying to determine why.</p>

<p>But I can say that I think homicide is a behavioral problem. I believe people need to learn how to settle their differences other than using violence, other than using guns. I don't' think that's just a problem here in Jackson, Mississippi; I think it's a problem across the nation.</p>

<p>You can have a million police officers out here—now keep in mind, we're going to do our part, we're going to be out there. We're going to hit the hot spots, we're going to hit the troubled areas, we're going to do everything that we can to reduce crime and reduce violent crime in the City of Jackson. But, I think, by and large, it's a big behavioral problem. People need to learn how to settle their difference other than using violence. I think if we educate people, I think that's going to be a big help to us.</p>

<p>I can say that we're doing various things when it comes to addressing crime. We're deploying several crime-fighting strategies. We typically have quarterly searches that we do in the City of Jackson. Now that's composed of our partners from the federal agencies, everybody from ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives), DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration, (U.S.) Marshals (Service).</p>

<p>We all come together, and we do these surges in Jackson at various times, which may be for three to four days, and those have been very successful in deterring crime in the City of Jackson.</p>

<p>Not only that, we also have other units, and I don't give away all of my crime-fighting tactics, but I'll just touch on them on the surface. We have a street-level unit that I used to run prior to becoming chief, and we address those various issues hitting hotspots in certain areas, problem areas where we have high crime. That unit works all over the city; it's composed of approximately 15 officers. It's been in existence for going on two years now.</p>

<p>That's been a big help in the City of Jackson along with DART (Direct Action Response Team), who's also out there doing a lot of good things.</p>

<p>A lot of times it's not just about being reactive, you have to have a proactive approach in order to fight and deter crime, I think that's extremely important.</p>

<p>How much support do federal agencies provide JPD, especially in programs like Operation Cross Country and Project EJECT?</p>

<p>It really depends on the type of crime. We get assistance from all the federal agencies, everybody from the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigations), ATF, and as I mentioned the DEA and the Marshals' service. Now, there is a task force that's currently in operation, it's known as the violent crime task force that's composed of members from those various agencies I mentioned. The idea is to go out and address violent crime.</p>

<p>What I mean by that is, let's say there's an armed robbery of a business, well, you'll have members from the task force who will go out on scene. Say JPD is dispatched out there. These members will go out on scene, assist in the investigation and come back and try to work that case and develop leads which could potentially lead to a federal investigation, or if it doesn't rise to that level, a local investigation or state investigation. So that's been very successful with our federal partners in addressing crime, and I can say we've had a high rate of success with that.</p>

<p>How much do you work with Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith?</p>

<p>A lot. Of course, I don't know if you're aware, we actually have an assistant district attorney assigned to the police department who's actually housed here. That is something that I, along with the agreement of DA Smith, that we instituted recently. It's been a big help.</p>

<p>An archive of reporting on controversies surrounding Hinds County district attorneys, present and past.</p>

<p>A lot of times having someone housed here in the police department is really beneficial to our detectives because they can discuss cases and go over cases. And you have a district attorney here that can help answer a lot of questions, you know, from the legal aspect.</p>

<p>I can remember years ago when I was a detective, we had that very thing here. We would have an ADA assigned to the police department. We were able to re-implement that, and that's been very successful. We started in January, and we want to continue that partnership along with the district attorney.</p>

<p>Could you touch on the topic of juveniles and perp walks in the City?</p>

<p>Well, perp walks is a practice that's been going on for some time. I along with the mayor's office have been discussing this, and we've decided to discontinue this practice for a couple reasons. We don't want to seem like a person is being criminalized by having them photographed as they're leaving out of the jail, handcuffs and waist shackles on them. We think that this is not in the best interest, and so we decided to discontinue that practice at this time.</p>

<p>Talk about the decision to withhold mugshots of citizens shot by police.</p>

<p>Well, again, I think it's a situation where you don't want to make it seem like a person is guilty of something by showing a mugshot of them. That's something that we've gotten away from. We just want to let the criminal-justice system and the process play out like it should and not seem like, again, we're trying to criminalize somebody based on a mugshot. So that's something that we are getting away from.</p>

<p>Are you looking to revise the use-of-force policy?</p>

<p>Absolutely, absolutely. That is a huge topic that I am currently looking into right now. And I can say it is going to be revised. It's no question about that. We anticipate probably having a new use-of-force policy I am hoping very, very soon. I can't give you an exact date on it. But, absolutely, we're definitely going to revise that.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>It's important—change of times. I mean, there's some things in our use-of-force policy we need to update. It's just plain and simple. We think that's important to do. Not only that, with the scrutiny that the Jackson Police Department has been under, we've taken a long look at it, and we do believe it needs a revision. So we are in a process of revising it now.</p>

<p>How do tasers work in this department?</p>

<p>Every officer in the department does not have a taser. We're in the process of trying to purchase tasers for every officer in the department to have one.</p>

<p>I want to say we have about maybe 60 to 65 officers (who) actually have tasers. We think that it's definitely a less lethal weapon that could be used, and it could be beneficial to us in not using deadly force in various instances. It's being worked on.</p>

<p>How about body cameras? Although imperfect, is there any interest for them at JPD?</p>

<p>There is. Of course funding is the biggest issue right now, and we're looking at trying to come up with some grant funding to try to see if we can purchase body cameras. That is something that is on our list, and we hope to have that accomplished real soon. Sometimes it takes time with grants, but that is something that we're looking at.</p>

<p>What's morale like at JPD?</p>

<p>I've been out to speak with the officers. I haven't spoken with every single officer in the department. I think they are optimistic. I like to go out and personally introduce myself and look at somebody face-to-face and talk to them and let them know what the vision is for the department. Getting feedback, I think they are optimistic about the future of the police department.</p>

<p>It's going to take time. Nothing happens overnight, and I think trying to implement new things and bring things to the police department, our officers understand that it takes time. So I want to make sure that I emphasize that to them where they can understand what we're trying to do.</p>

<p>Can you talk about your academic background with criminal justice?</p>

<p>I've been in it a long time. I started out back in 2000, so I've been teaching for 18 years. I teach criminal justice and political science courses. My background is in both political science and criminal justice. I have graduate degrees in those areas. I've been teaching at Hinds Community College and also Jackson State. I enjoy it. I still do it on a limited basis, but it's been adventurous. Once I retire (from JPD), it's something that I want to keep doing in the future, and I've enjoyed every bit of it, the entire 18 years I've been doing it. It's helped me a lot in my skills and experience being a better person in being able to apply some of those things at the police department.</p>

<p>How long have you been in Jackson, and what do you hope for the city?</p>

<p>I've been here all my life. Obviously I want Jackson to be a safe city, that's first and foremost.</p>

<p>By Stephen Wilson</p>

<p>I would love to see it flourish back to the way it used to be. I would love to see our infrastructure be a lot better. I want to see businesses come back to Jackson. I want to see Metrocenter Mall come back to life.</p>

<p>A lot of times people grow up and they leave Jackson. I've had a vested interest in Jackson all my life, decided not to leave. Had a few opportunities to leave, but I love Jackson been here all my life, and I don't plan on going anywhere when I retire.</p>

<p>This has been my home, I have a passion for Jackson. I want to see it get back to being one of the most thriving cities, and I think we're doing that.</p>

<p>A lot of the things that the mayor's implemented in the City of Jackson are a lot of good things, and I think we're getting back on track to where we need to be.</p>

<p>What made you want to be a police officer?</p>

<p>Ever since I was a kid, it was something that I always dreamed about. I can remember coming up that I used to be a police explorer. We have that program today. It was just something that I dreamed as a kid that I always wanted to be a police officer. I've been fortunate and blessed enough to be able to put on the uniform ever since I was 20, 21 years old and enjoy what I do every single day. Wouldn't trade anything for it. I'm just one of those diehard people when it comes to what I do.</p>

<p>Why do you think you were chosen to be interim chief?</p>

<p>Well, that's a decision the mayor made obviously. I think a lot of officers around the police department respect me as an individual and know what I stand for and that was a deciding factor in why I became interim chief. So, that's what I can say. I think the mayor has confidence in me to be able to run this department and make sure that it's being run and managed the best it can be. But, I think a lot of it did happen based on my character and who I am.</p>

<p>Do you want to stay on as chief permanently?</p>

<p>Yes, I would love to. There are a lot of things I would like to see change here; it's going to take a little time to get them done. But I would love to serve as permanent chief. Of course, that's not my decision. We'll see how things work out.</p>

<p>What would you want people to know about you?</p>

<p>I can say that I'm a passionate person, I believe in treating people fairly, and I believe in our officers treating people fairly and with professionalism and respect. So I want the citizens to know that we're going to do everything in our power to make sure that we're the most professional police department here in the state of Mississippi.</p>

<p>With that being said, obviously I want crime to go down, and I think it's important for us to be proactive, and I think it's important for us to have a connection with the community—community policing is paramount. You must have community policing; you have to have the citizens support you. If not, you're going to fail.</p>

<p>Having that support, having the community behind us, us partnering with the community is extremely important. I can say there's a lot of things that we're doing right now when it comes to that.</p>

<p>We have COPS (Community Oriented Policing Services) meetings every month where we sit down with members out of the community in each precinct and discuss crime issues. We have individual meetings with citizens that may want to talk with a commander.</p>

<p>Bigger things are citizens' police academies, from which we recently had approximately 35 citizens graduate. I encourage all citizens to try to go through the citizens police academy. It really gives you a sideline view of what the police department is about and what officers do on a daily basis. And we have nothing but positive feedback from it. We went from having citizens police academies two times year to four times a year now. Our next one is going to be scheduled in June.</p>

<p>Would you say police have a scary job day-to-day?</p>

<p>It is. Being a police officer is a tough job. Police officers are often faced with dangerous, violent situations on a daily basis that a lot of times the media never hears about. Officers put their lives on the line each and every day. They don't know if they're going to come home at night to their families.</p>

<p>But we know what we signed up for, we know what we have to do as officers, and we take that risk every single day we put on the uniform. It's part of the job, and I can say.</p>

<p>A lot of times officers engage in situations where they de-escalate them. No violence is used, nobody gets hurt. And I know that there have been some issues with officers when it comes to officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>It's a dangerous job, and with encountering the criminal element that these officers do, it's tough. I'm thankful that no officers have been seriously injured, and I pray that that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>When they took an oath to serve, they understand what they face.</p>

<p>Does JPD communicate with families of people that police shot and killed?</p>

<p>We've reached out. I personally reached out to the (Crystalline) Barnes family and expressed my condolences.</p>

<p>I've said in the past, these are very unfortunate situations. Nobody wins.</p>

<p>It's just bad when it comes to officer-involved shootings, and I expressed my sentiments all the time, and I just think it's very unfortunate. ... But again, it's part of the job that we do.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions is praising the efforts of federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies, including the Jackson Police Department, for sweeps in Jackson netting 45 arrests, of which 31 are "documented gang members," he says. hoto courtesy Flickr/Gage Skidmore</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. — The U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement today praising its operation last week alongside the Jackson Police Department and other agencies that swept up 45 people in Jackson, including 31 "documented gang members, the release says. The sweeps were a part of the controversial Project Eject/Safe Neighborhood strategy that Sessions resuscitated since Donald Trump's election. The DOJ press statement follows, verbatim:</p>

<p>JACKSON, MS – The U.S. Marshals Service’s Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force, made up of Deputy U.S. Marshals and other federal, state and local law enforcement officers, increased their numbers, expanded their operations, and led a successful violent crime reduction initiative last week in the Jackson metro area, announced U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst and U.S. Marshal George White. This surge of law enforcement, in cooperation with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Project EJECT, executed outstanding warrants, targeted known gang members and their associates, and searched for sex offenders who had violated the terms of their supervised release. The Task Force also worked to identify targets and collect tangible criminal intelligence to further its work in the future of removing violent criminal offenders from the streets.</p>

<p>“When law enforcement officers work together, we get results,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. “The arrest of more than 30 gang members in Jackson is the result of effective collaboration between all levels of law enforcement – federal, state and local – to target the most violent criminals in our communities. It’s also an example of how customizing our strategy at the local level through the Project Safe Neighborhoods program helps us use our resources more effectively. I want to thank our Deputy U.S. Marshals and all of the task force members who played a role in these arrests. They exemplify the proven law enforcement methods that we will continue to prioritize going forward.”</p>

<p>“We are dismantling gangs, prosecuting violent criminals and removing sex offenders from the streets of Jackson,” said U.S. Attorney Hurst. “I commend the U.S. Marshals and the Gulf Coast Fugitive Task Force for substantially increasing their manpower this past week in our Capitol City, becoming a force multiplier on our streets and proactively taking the fight directly to the criminal element. I look forward to our office prosecuting some of these violent criminals under Project EJECT. It is only through such cooperation among law enforcement, and by empowering our citizens and our communities, that we will make Jackson and its people safer and more secure.”</p>

<p>During last week’s operation, the Fugitive Task Force increased its manpower to 60 members and was able to arrest 45 individuals, 31 of whom were documented gang members, including Gangster Disciples, Vice Lords, Simon City Royals, Latin Kings, and the Aryan Brotherhood, among others. During these arrests, a number of firearms were seized and several arrestees were found to be in possession of various illegal drugs, including marijuana, ecstasy, and crystal methamphetamine. While the details of these arrests cannot yet be made public, as investigations are ongoing, some of these individuals are expected to be prosecuted under Project EJECT.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Hurst, who accompanied the Task Force one night during their operations, praised the tenacity, dedication and professionalism of these Deputy U.S. Marshals and Task Force Officers from the following agencies:</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department</p>

<p>Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics</p>

<p>Hinds County Sheriff’s Office</p>

<p>Mississippi Bureau of Investigations</p>

<p>Rankin County Sheriff’s Office</p>

<p>Mississippi Department of Corrections</p>

<p>Homeland Security Investigations</p>

<p>Madison County Sheriff’s Office</p>

<p>Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives</p>

<p>United States Attorney’s Office</p>

<p>Metro 1 Medical Air Support</p>

<p>Project EJECT is an initiative by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi under the U.S. Department of Justice’s Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program bringing together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to reduce violent crime and make our neighborhoods safer for everyone. Attorney General Jeff Sessions reinvigorated PSN in 2017 as part of the Department’s renewed focus on targeting violent criminals, directing all U.S. Attorney’s Offices to work in partnership with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and the local community to develop effective, locally-based strategies to reduce violent crime.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Gov. Phil Bryant has vetoed a bill that he says would cause a financial hardship to the Mississippi Department of Corrections.</p>

<p>Bryant says Senate Bill 2841 would have erased the discretion of department employees or judges to grant hardship waivers for offenders who say they're too poor to pay $55-a-month fees while on probation, parole or other supervision.</p>

<p>The bill would have made waivers automatic for those fitting the federal definition of poverty. Bryant says the current process has worked, and granting more waivers could cost the Department of Corrections millions of dollars.</p>

<p>The governor says he regrets that the veto kills other parts of the bill, including expansion of treatment options for people supervised by drug courts and suspension of driver's licenses for drug convictions unrelated to driving.</p>

<h2 id="mayorlumumbapoliceoutofsync">Mayor Lumumba, Police Out of Sync?</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>As the City prepares for the first officer-identification task-force meeting on April 11, Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba and Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore might not be in sync when it comes to officer-involved shootings. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — If you walked into Jackson City Hall two weeks ago at just after 7 p.m., you would have seen the mayor's chief of staff, Safiya Omari, in a tense, loud exchange with public defender Adofo Minka, who had just criticized Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba publicly on how he is handling officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>The capital city has had two fatal officer-involved shootings this year alone, with seven total shootings by police since the mayor took office in July. The Jackson Police Department has a longstanding practice of withholding those officers' names.</p>

<p>During public comments at the March 27 city council meeting, Minka, who is also an occasional columnist for the Jackson Free Press, pressured the mayor to clarify his position on releasing names of officers who shoot civilians. Earlier that day, the mayor had signed an executive order to create a task force to evaluate how the City will handle transparency in officer-involved shootings moving forward, but Minka wanted to know more.</p>

<p>"I'm not asking where a task force stands," Minka said then. "I'm asking you as the mayor of the City of Jackson right now where you stand."</p>

<p>The two men have a history dating back to the early days of both men's legal careers, and Minka has been active in the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, which the mayor's father helped start. In response to Minka, Lumumba said he had heard from both sides of the argument, but that the process needed to move beyond him.</p>

<p>"[I]f it was just Chokwe that had to make the decision based on his personal views, then I would release them," the mayor said. "But I also give people opportunity for a democratic process...."</p>

<p>"To be clear, you're bringing government bureaucracy to the table through a task force," Minka shouted back, as he turned to walk out of the chambers. City Council President Charles Tillman of Ward 5 struck his gavel. "That's not the people," Minka added.</p>

<p>The rift between the mayor and Minka is not the only fracture over policing the mayor faces. As Lumumba looks for consensus over how the City handles officer-involved shootings, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore's department wants to leave things where they are, with officers asking the community to support JPD.</p>

<p>'Luxury of Anonymity'</p>

<p>Chief Moore walked into the meeting room at JPD headquarters in a light-blue oxford, gray slacks, an olive-green tie and his gun on his waist on March 27. Nearly a dozen officers filed in behind him, standing shoulder to shoulder behind the podium where Moore stood to address the room.</p>

<p>The day before that meeting, a message went up on the NextDoor neighborhood website warning that the City might force JPD to release officer names within 72 hours of cop-involved shootings—a nationally recommended standard used in many cities. The post encouraged concerned community members to show up to the precinct meeting to support JPD.</p>

<p>Moore addressed a mixed-race crowd that nodded and sounded off in agreement whenever anyone brought up officer safety. He said wanted to learn about how people feel about the practice, and yielded to Paul Hobson, the president of the Jackson Police Officer Association, the labor union that represents JPD officers. Hobson said Jackson's small size means the officers do not have the "luxury of anonymity" like some of the larger cities do—a reason the police union does not believe in releasing names.</p>

<p>"I can tell you and assure you that 100 percent of our department is against the release of officer names as it pertains to shootings," Hobson said. "We believe that there should be transparency in the process ... but we do not believe that it is in the best practice to release names." Hobson is a member of the new officer-identification task force.</p>

<p>Deputy Chief Tyrone Buckley seconded what Hobson said about anonymity because his kids go to Jackson Public Schools, he said, adding that JPD has made progress by working with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>"Just recently, we elected MBI to come in and do all our officer-involved shootings. That adds another level of transparency," Buckley said.</p>

<p>The bureau has stepped in to investigate the last officer-involved shooting that claimed the life of Lee Edward Bonner in February. It is also investigating an officer-involved shooting by Flowood police at a Kroger there.</p>

<p>Buckley tried to make the case that crime suspects in Jackson are not plastered throughout the press, which is actually a standard practice in this City throughout different types of media. He said that if officers' names went out following an officer-involved shooting, the "officer could be convicted way before going before a jury of his peers."</p>

<p>National experts acknowledge that officers can be in danger after shooting someone on the job, but call for balancing that concern with the public's right to know. "If (departments) are coming out, and they're saying, 'we've got to protect our officers,' and they're not talking about what the cost is to community trust, that's probably not someone who's balancing the right set of things," Philip Atiba Goff, president of the Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College in New York, said in March.</p>

<p>The room agreed with Buckley, and throughout the meeting, people asked officers how they could support them further. Keyshia Sanders of constituent services, who represented the mayor's office, encouraged them to speak before the council that night. Only one woman did, however.</p>

<p>Thin Blue Line</p>

<p>Susan Lunardini, wearing a baby yellow sweater, stood up at the precinct meeting to talk about the importance of law enforcement. As a Jackson resident, business owner and former president of the Jackson Police Foundation, she expressed concern that releasing officer names would gravely affect recruiting, and also might incite violence from families of loved ones shot by JPD.</p>

<p>"I greatly feel for the victims' families," she said. "I know they want information, it's the first thing you want. ... But vengeance is in the heart of some people when they're in grief, and it just is a dangerous emotion until you have time to work through it." Lunardini was one of the only people to mention families of people who JPD has shot. Later that night, Lunardini spoke at city hall just before Minka. "I want to see that thin blue line we have get thicker and longer. It's just what gives us civilization," she said.</p>

<p>Minka feels the opposite. "When we have a situation where people's human rights can be abused and officers can skirt being identified, you have a police-state situation," Minka said before the council.</p>

<p>With clear polarity between the mayor's personal views and JPD, but also citizens like Minka and Lunardini, the 21-person task-force will have to pack a lot into their bi-monthly meetings beginning April 11.</p>

<p>Six of them are law-enforcement officers.</p>

<h2 id="editoriallumumbaadministrationmustbeproactiveappointpromptly">EDITORIAL: Lumumba Administration Must Be Proactive, Appoint Promptly</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Editorial Board</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-11</p>

<p>As soon as Gov. Phil Bryant signs legislation reauthorizing the Jackson Convention and Visitors Bureau, Lumumba will have 90 days to confirm six members to the board that technically controls the actions of JCVB. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>There's a modern-day adage that is good advice for the Lumumba administration: "Stay ready so you don't have to get ready." As we get to the one-year mark of Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba's time as mayor, it is clear that he has not tended to all the regular business of the city. Take the unfilled school board, the lackluster and even retroactive "fight" for the zoo, and the out-of-compliance Jackson Convention and Visitors Bureau (see page 7).</p>

<p>We applaud the mayor for reaching a needed compromise to avoid a state takeover of the Jackson Public School District. However, Ward 3 has gone without a school-board member for more than four months, while the rest of the board has been seated since November. Is he waiting for the six-member board to reach an impasse with an evenly split vote to realize the dire need for a seventh member, especially with the superintendent search?</p>

<p>Early in his term, Lumumba sat down with the leadership of the Jackson Zoo to hear their concerns, and they felt hopeful at that time. Fast forward to late March, and the zoo has decided to pack up and leave west Jackson. The mayor just announced a press conference for April 11 about keeping the zoo where it is, but it might be too late—the executive director of the zoo, Beth Poff, is already envisioning her new zoo elsewhere with donor support after years of failed promises to revive the area around the current one. This last-ditch effort to save the zoo is reactive rather than proactive.</p>

<p>In December, the mayor and the JCVB ping-ponged blame over who was responsible for proposing an increased 2-percent tax to fund the bureau that was up for legislative reauthorization. The city council rejected the heightened tax, and meanwhile, members are still sitting on the board with expired terms, and the mayor is responsible for those nominations needed to comply with the law.</p>

<p>As soon as Gov. Phil Bryant signs legislation reauthorizing the Jackson Convention and Visitors Bureau, Lumumba will have 90 days to confirm six members to the board that technically controls the actions of JCVB. We encourage the mayor to appoint these members promptly and quickly and fill that remaining school-board position. Ten months in, it is time for the administration to get organized, become proactive and plan ahead on all fronts.</p>

<p>When the run-up to the 2016 primary season started, I was so ready to feel the Bern, y'all. I wasn't a Hillary stan even though I loved her in the '90s as a young woman. What I didn't like as a feminist was being told to support her due to our shared gender without knowing her specific platforms. I was feeling Bernie.</p>

<p>Yet some people can't be invited to the cookout. They just can't. They might sound like they are kinda down but then they open their mouth a few too many times, and there it is—nonsense just flows freely from their lips like water over Niagara falls. Bernie cannot come to the cookout. Sorry, not sorry.</p>

<p>It is also why Bernie Sanders shouldn't come to any Martin Luther King Jr. memorial events in Jackson, such as tonight's town hall with Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba. Sanders has no place here, certainly not as a featured speaker. Before someone thinks I'm saying this simply because he's white, that's not why. But it does inform how I came to this conclusion because his privilege as a white man (yes, I know he's Jewish) informs how he moves in the world.</p>

<p>Shortly before his death, MLK launched the Poor People's Campaign, envisioning it as a multiracial coalition to combat poverty. He understood that poverty, while impacting racial groups, differently cuts across all societal groups. What MLK never did that Bernie Sanders has repeatedly done is say that class concerns override racial issues. That isn't true. The Poor People's Campaign recognized that simply in the way it was designed to work—as a coalition of voices with shared goals.</p>

<p>A coalition means I can come to the table and be fully present as a black woman with needs and concerns for my community. So, too, can every other community, and we all move forward together with everyone's needs in mind. What it doesn't mean is doing what Bernie has done repeatedly—throwing people of color under the bus in order to make white voters comfortable by denouncing "identity politics" and saying that racism didn't really influence white Trump voters. It was just "economic anxiety," he tells us.</p>

<p>It doesn't mean appeasing those who think abortion is icky by saying it's OK to be flexible on abortion rights. They are rights; what is there to be flexible about? There is no economic justice without racial justice and reproductive justice.</p>

<p>There is also no economic justice without safe communities that have fewer guns on our streets. Most of us in Jackson, including black gun owners like myself, know that but Bernie Sanders has been iffy about gun-control measures as black families have been victims of gun violence grieving and marching for our dead loved ones for decades.</p>

<p>Sanders needs to make up his mind if he's "in for a penny in for a pound" as the elders say. So far he's just playing the hokey pokey with social justice and, frankly, black people and especially black women don't need any more white so-called allies who do that.</p>

<p>Martin Luther King Jr. was many things but he was never a man who was flexible about human rights. He died working for economic and racial justice. He certainly wasn't a man who didn't understand intersectionality even before we had a word for it. The Poor People's Campaign is an intersectional vision.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders' so-called "revolution" of mostly white people is not any such thing. As I write this, I am confused and insulted that our city and our mayor whom I've supported would bring this man to honor one of the most revered black leaders in our history. We're supposed to believe that Bernie Sanders has insight on the economic legacy and vision of Martin Luther King Jr. when he doesn't even understand the racism of white people and intersectionality?</p>

<p>I'm not here for it.</p>

<p>This town hall isn't special; they are taking the usual Bernie town hall and putting Martin Luther King's name on it. It's glaringly obvious, offensive and frankly it is just gross. This is especially true as our city is still refusing to address state-sanctioned violence in the form of a long string of police shootings since last summer with the mayor and police chief, so far, refusing to reveal the officers' identity or other specifics.</p>

<p>Jackson, let's really talk about economic justice and how it's tied to reproductive justice, gender justice, disability justice, racial justice, birth justice and criminal-justice reform. Otherwise, the discussion is incomplete. Bernie Sanders isn't the person who can have that conversation. He gets no invite to the cookout, none.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Cries of "Bernie 2020!" accented the conversation between U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba at a town hall on economic justice 50 years to the night since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis.</p>

<p>Thalia Mara Hall in downtown Jackson hosted the predominantly white audience, mostly Sanders supporters in T-shirts with slogans like "Feel the Bern" or even one that said "Don't Blame Me I Voted for Bernie," among other paraphernalia with Sanders' face on it. Some arrived an hour before the doors officially opened at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>Sanders told the crowd that he had come to Mississippi because he believes the Democratic Party has to become a 50-state party, which prompted enormous cheers from the crowd.</p>

<p>In line with the theme, Sanders said King was his "major political inspiration," and that he resonates with the work for economic justice King did toward the end of his life.</p>

<p>"You have got to ask yourselves ... how it could be that in this great country with so much wealth, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth? Bad for whites, much worse for African Americans," Sanders said. "How could it be that we are the only major country not to guarantee healthcare to all people—," but the cheering crowd didn't let him finish.</p>

<p>Sanders picked back up saying that Dr. King taught us to have a bold vision and to move the country forward to create the America the late hero envisioned.</p>

<p>Race, and Also Class </p>

<p>Hours before the town hall, Sanders was in Memphis for the "I Am 2018" rally and events throughout the city where King took his last breaths after a white assassin shot him on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel. King had gone to Memphis in 1968 to support a sanitation workers' strike after two black men, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, had been crushed in a faulty trash truck.</p>

<p>Less than two weeks later, black men from the public works department in Memphis went on strike to fight poor wages that left many of them on welfare and food stamps and working on dangerously malfunctioning trucks.</p>

<p>King stepped in to help, as the mission of this strike directly supported his Poor People's Campaign for economic justice. With hesitation, King went back to Memphis on April 3 and spoke before sanitation workers there, delivering his final and now iconic speech, "I've Been to the Mountaintop." He was killed the next day.</p>

<p>The Memphis sanitation strike in 1968 was inextricably linked to race, and therefore class because black people were second-class citizens still. Sanders described it without including that important nuance, or the race of the sanitation workers, which often draws him criticism.</p>

<p>"All of us know where he was when he was assassinated 50 years ago today," Sanders said. "He was in Memphis to stand with low-income sanitation workers who were being exploited ruthlessly, whose wages were abysmally low and were trying to create a union."</p>

<p>Racial inequality in Memphis is still real 50 years later. 2015 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission statistics say white people in Memphis held 88 percent of senior-level management and executive positions, while more than 70 percent of labor workers and service workers were black. In the 2010 census, Memphis ranked sixth out of 10 American cities with the largest number of black people.</p>

<p>Those same 2015 EEO numbers show that white executive/senior-level officials and managers in Jackson make up more than 86 percent of those positions, while black people only represent 12 percent of those roles, despite Jackson being nearly 80 percent black.</p>

<p>As Lumumba pointed out, economic injustice in Jackson, and the entire state is prevalent, too.</p>

<p>"The Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected, I woke up in Jackson, Mississippi," Lumumba said. "And what that means to me is no matter whether Donald Trump is the president, to be honest no matter whether Barack Obama, Bill Clinton or George Bush, we've always been at the bottom.</p>

<p>"Jackson, Mississippi, or Mississippi as a state, no matter whether the country is experiencing great booms or busts in terms of its economy, we are always at the bottom. And so what is apparent to me is that we have to begin to rescue ourselves," Lumumba added.</p>

<p>'Charismatic' Obama and a 'Big Giant Redneck'</p>

<p>Sanders also evoked President Barack Obama's name in a comment that some on social media took to be offensive because they felt the senator downplayed America's first black president in an event meant to honor another black leader.</p>

<p>"The business model, if you like, of the Democratic Party for the last 15 years or so, has been a failure," Sanders said in response to a question about how to harness millennial energy in efforts to reimagine the Democratic Party in Jackson and beyond.</p>

<p>"[P]eople sometimes don't see that because there was a charismatic individual named Barack Obama who won the presidency in 2008 and 2012. He was obviously an extraordinary candidate, brilliant guy. But, behind that reality, over the last 10 years, Democrats have lost about 1,000 seats in state legislatures all across this country," Sanders added.</p>

<p>This was not Sanders' first trip to this area. In 2017, Sanders came to Canton, Miss., in support of the polarizing efforts to unionize Nissan plant workers there—a campaign that ultimately failed with more than 62 percent of workers voting against the union.</p>

<p>However, from the union T-shirts with Sanders on them and long-time union leaders like Johnnie Smith, 54, a white Mississippian who voted for Sanders in the primaries, last night made it clear that the 2017 loss didn't ice "the Bern" for many people.</p>

<p>Smith was one of the first to arrive at the town hall in cowboy boots, a John Deere trucker hat, a denim jacket over a black button-up shirt tucked into jeans held up with an American flag belt buckle. He gets frustrated that people often mistake him for a Republican or Trump supporter, when, in actuality, he voted for Hillary Clinton "when it counted," but initially supported Sanders because of his economic-justice campaign.</p>

<p>"They look at me as a big giant redneck, and it's probably true. But, I grew up in the sticks and poor. Trade unions helped me to get out of poverty," Smith told the Jackson Free Press. He came to the town hall to hear some progressive voices—a welcome change to what he calls, "the conservative junk that you hear day in and day out."</p>

<p>JACKSON — Flonzie Brown-Wright first met Martin Luther King Jr. over the phone. She lived in Canton and got a phone call from King himself three days before the participants in the March Against Fear in 1966 got to Canton on their march from Memphis.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dr. King how can I help you?" Brown-Wright recalled answering the phone.</p>

<p>"Can you provide housing and food for 3,000 people?" King had said.</p>

<p>"Without giving it a thought. Without wondering 'Should I?' 'Could I?'...'Why me,' I said to him, 'Y,es I can.' And when I hung up the phone, my knees knocked. I got very nervous, but I knew I could do it. I knew I could do it because Canton was so together," Brown-Wright said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The marchers came to Canton and registered lots of black residents to vote, and Brown-Wright, who later became the first African American woman in Mississippi to hold public office as an election commissioner, recalled seeing thousands of marchers sleeping in yards, homes and gyms in Canton. She also remembered King sitting down with a dozen Mississippians in Canton before completing the march to Jackson.</p>

<p>"I sat at his feet, while he shared with us, 'My days are numbered. I won't be with you very long. The freedom movement, the Civil Rights Movement, is not about Martin King, it's about you. If the movement dies with me, it was never about me,'" Brown-Wright said Wednesday.</p>

<p>"He asked 12 local people that day to make him a promise that as long as we lived, as long as we saw racism, as long as we saw segregation, separation, that we would call it out for what it is. That we would confront it for what it is, but also try and find a remedy to be able to make the lives of people better—not just black folk people, brown people, tan people, red, yellow, black and white," she continued.</p>

<p>Brown-Wright, Charles McLaurin and James Meredith spoke at the 2 Mississippi Museums on Wednesday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of King's death and reflect on how his work affected them personally.</p>

<p>McLaurin, who was active in the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, shared a story about playing touch football with King in Georgia during Southern Christian Leadership Conference training.</p>

<p>"I got a chance down there during the break one day to play touch football with Dr. King. ... Bernard Lee, John Lewis and others who were down there ... and I didn't really think much about that until a few days ago," he said on Wednesday, remembering his time in Dorchester, Ga.</p>

<p>McLaurin, a Jackson native, joined SNCC after hearing King speak and meeting him in Jackson in 1961. McLaurin went on to work with SNCC, registering black Mississippians to vote and working with Fannie Lou Hamer on her Congress run and political campaign.</p>

<p>"I was so amazed and elated over the fact that the guy could stand up and just let kind of words flow from his mouth," McLaurin said. "And he's talking about things of significance that I had read about in history books."</p>

<p>In 1968, McLaurin spent some time with King in the Delta, three weeks before his assassination. King was pulling together the Poor People's Campaign at that time, McLaurin said, and he drove him to catch his plane outside of Clarksdale back to Atlanta. King was assassinated outside the Lorraine Motel in Memphis a few weeks later on April 4, 1968.</p>

<p>Meredith, who famously integrated the University of Mississippi in 1962, also led the March Against Fear in 1966. He was shot and wounded along the route from Memphis to Jackson, but black-freedom organizations rallied in response, completing the march and detouring through the Delta. It was during that march route that Stokely Carmichael was thrown in jail for trying to set up a tent for marchers in the Delta. McLaurin said they helped get Carmichael out of jail; they had to set up the tent in a park in the middle of the black Delta community.</p>

<p>McLaurin recalled Carmichael stepping up to the stage, famously saying, "'We have no power. Black people have no power. ... We need some black power.'"</p>

<p>As the March Against Fear continued, the marchers worked to register African American Mississippians to vote as they went along—eventually staying in Canton with Brown Wright's community.</p>

<h2 id="mississippicourtwomanhasparentrightsinsamesexsplit">Mississippi Court: Woman Has Parent Rights in Same-Sex Split</h2>

<p>Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi's Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a woman has parental rights to a 6-year-old boy born to her ex-wife when the two were married, in a case watched by gay rights activists and groups aiding in vitro fertilization.</p>

<p>Christina "Chris" Strickland brought the appeal, challenging a lower court decision that an anonymous sperm donor still had parental rights and that Strickland did not. Strickland ultimately hopes to win 50-50 custody of Zayden Strickland, who bears her last name and was born by Kimberly Day through artificial means when Day and Strickland were married.</p>

<p>"I'm on cloud nine right now," Strickland said by phone. "I knew I was my son's mother from the start and I would be at the end and this just confirms it with the Supreme Court backing me 100 percent."</p>

<p>All nine justices, in a series of separate opinions, found flaws in the original ruling by Rankin County Chancery Judge John Grant III, which favored a sperm donor over Stickland. The case was ordered back to Grant for further proceedings to decide on custody of Zayden Strickland, with orders to treat Christina Strickland as an equal co-parent.</p>

<p>"At bottom, to deny Christina the relationship she has built with Z.S. would be a miscarriage of justice," Associate Justice David Ishee wrote for a four-judge plurality.</p>

<p>The justices found that Grant's ruling that the unknown sperm donor had parental rights and that Strickland did not was unworkable and unfair, saying such a standard would "would disrupt the familial relationships and expectations of Mississippians who have conceived children" using artificial insemination.</p>

<p>"For one, it would elevate the rights of a donor — who is a complete stranger to the child, and likely never will be identified — over the rights of a person who has known and cared for the child," Ishee wrote.</p>

<p>The original judge had granted Strickland visitation rights and she pays child support. But Attorney Beth Littrell, who works for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Strickland had a much inferior status to legal parenthood.</p>

<p>Day's lawyer argued that sperm and egg donors should have legal rights and that when a child is conceived through artificial means, a second parent is more akin to someone who is adopting a child. The lawyer, Prentiss Grant, had argued Strickland should have gone through the legal process of terminating the sperm donor's parental rights during the divorce proceeding.</p>

<p>Grant didn't immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment late Thursday.</p>

<p>Justices wrote that a ruling for Day could have allowed another adult to adopt Zayden Strickland, and if Day had died as the sole parent, Zayden Strickland could have ended up as an orphan in state custody. A ruling against Strickland could have meant that opposite-sex couples who use someone else's eggs or sperm would have had to terminate donors' parental rights to achieve legal status.</p>

<p>Some justices said the court was going too far, ruling on a legal principle that wasn't argued in the original trial or saying they should order Grant to basically start the case over.</p>

<p>Chief Justice William Waller Jr., who provided a key fifth vote agreeing with the outcome of the four-justice opinion, wrote separately that Mississippi lawmakers needed to clarify state law.</p>

<p>"The Legislature should speak directly to the recognition of the legal status of children born during a marriage as the result of assisted reproductive technology," Waller wrote.</p>

<p>Littrell said she was also pleased that no Mississippi justices opposed Strickland because of same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>In a 2015 opinion where the Mississippi Supreme Court granted a divorce to lesbian couple, two of its justices questioned the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage and suggested that its landmark ruling has no constitutional basis. One of those justices has since retired.</p>

<h2 id="mississippioutslegalimmigrantsondriverslicenses">Mississippi Outs Legal Immigrants on Drivers' Licenses</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-04</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/apr/04/mississippi-outs-legal-immigrants-licenses/ </p>

<p>Mississippi has a policy that brands immigrants’ driver licenses with the words “Non-US Citizen” despite the fact that they must present proof that they are in the U.S. legally to get the I.D. Photo courtesy Abigail Pena Mandujano</p>

<p>JACKSON — Abigail Piña Mandujano had to start carrying her visa with her when she drives because her license is not enough to fend off questions from law-enforcement officials at roadblocks, she says. That's because "Non-US Citizen Driver License" is emblazoned on Mandujano's Mississippi driver's license in red letters.</p>

<p>"[D]own here we have a lot of roadblocks, and the officers will question me, and I've had to actually start carrying my visa because some of them will ask for it," Mandujano, who lives in Blue Springs, told the Jackson Free Press recently.</p>

<p>Mandujano is not a U.S. citizen, but she is in the country legally. She has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, meaning her parents brought her to the U.S. as a young child. She has lived in the U.S. for 18 years since her family came from Mexico City when she was 3 years old. When she turned 18 in 2013, she went to get her driver's license and found that she and fellow DACA immigrants had different licenses than their other Mississippi friends.</p>

<p>Licensing for immigrants varies in different states, but Mandujano said her friends in other states do not carry licenses labeled that way.</p>

<p>Amelia McGowan, an immigration attorney at the Catholic Charities Migrant Support Center in Jackson, said she is unaware of another state with the "Non-US Citizen" demarcation on the license.</p>

<p>"We have a number of clients who apply for driver's licenses," McGowan said. "You have to have immigration status ... to get a driver's license, so if you are undocumented you cannot get a license in the Mississippi."</p>

<p>That's the unique part of Mississippi's policy. The "Non US Citizen" could imply that a documented immigrant is not in the U.S. illegally, although undocumented immigrants cannot obtain a driver's license at all.</p>

<p>"If you are a non-U.S. citizen, you must meet all other requirements for obtaining an operator's license or identification card except for providing a Social Security card," the DPS website says. To get a license, an immigrant must present valid immigration papers, a birth certificate that is translated by a state-run university or an approved translator, passport and other proof of residency.</p>

<p>The license is good for the amount of time an immigrant's visa or papers allow her to stay.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press obtained the Department of Public Safety's "Out-of Country and Non US Citizens License and ID Applicants policy, which was most recently updated in November 2013. The policy shows that the "Non US Citizen" demarcation is required. "All applicants who are Non US Citizens must be issued a credential marked 'Non-US Citizen,'" it states.</p>

<p>It is unclear how long this has been the policy of DPS or the purpose for this specific designation on an immigrant license. The Department of Public Safety did not respond to repeated interview requests from the Jackson Free Press about the policy or its purpose.</p>

<p>Bad Impressions</p>

<p>Mandujano is attending Itawamba Community College and wants to transfer to the University of Mississippi eventually. But as a non-U.S. citizen, she does not qualify for state financial aid for school, so she works to pay for her education. Some states have changed their laws to allow DACA recipients to receive financial aid for college. In Mississippi, Rep. Kathy Sykes, D-Jackson, introduced a similar measure this year, but it got little traction in a Republican-supermajority statehouse that passed legislation banning "sanctuary cities" statewide.</p>

<p>After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress passed the "Real ID Act" requiring states to upgrade and intensify their I.D.s. This meant a mix of policy changes in different states pertaining to immigrants. The Connecticut state government recently created a drive-only license that allows undocumented immigrants to at least drive around the fairly rural state, Kara Hart, an immigration attorney there, said.</p>

<p>"[I]f someone is stopped for whatever reason, at least they are not going to be cited for driving without for a license, so that removes an enormous worry from people who are driving particularly in places where you may not have access," Hart said.</p>

<p>Hart said Mississippi's licensing law is different than other states that she has looked at because the "Non US Citizen" licenses include immigrants who are lawfully present. While Connecticut's drive-only licenses might be an obvious sign to law-enforcement officers that the person is undocumented, a "Non US Citizen" license in Mississippi gives no such impression—in theory.</p>

<p>In practice, however, Mandujano is asked about her immigration status regularly despite being in the country legally, she says.</p>

<p>"They start questioning, 'well, why are you here if you're not legal?' And I think a lot of people don't understand that you can be legal but not a citizen, so you've got all these questions coming," she says. Such instances happen in Walmart or at roadblocks when she shows her Mississippi license.</p>

<p>"Even if you are legal here ... a lot of DACA recipients still live in the shadows, even though we are legal," she continued. "... It's a huge load to carry when people already have a bad impression of immigrants.</p>

<p>In the music world, self-titled albums are common, and self-titled songs are less so. Having two self-titled songs on the same album—well, that is an anomaly. But then again, Justin Scott, better known as hip-hop artist Big K.R.I.T., says that he has always felt like a bit of an anomaly.</p>

<p>It is a feeling that has long been present in his work, from the space-inspired cover art, atmospheric sounds, but also in the meta-narrative behind his music. It is a story that is still unfolding, he says.</p>

<p>The Meridian, Miss., native announced in the summer of 2016 that he had split from Def Jam Records after about six years with the legendary label. Rather than seeking out a new contract with another major label, though, Scott decided to use the opportunity to officially launch his own label, Multi Alumni. More than that, he says that he wanted to take time and create his most personal and expansive recording project yet.</p>

<p>In late October 2017, after about two and a half years of working on the project, Scott put out his third studio album as Big K.R.I.T., "4eva Is a Mighty Long Time," a 22-track double album that centered on his duality as an entertainer and as a real person.</p>

<p>Scott is currently on the road promoting the album through the "Heavy Is the Crown" national tour, which brings him to the capital city on Thursday, April 5. The Jackson Free Press recently spoke with him over the phone about the process of tackling two sides of himself on "4eva Is a Mighty Long Time," and taking the reins of his career as an artist, producer and executive.</p>

<p>What made you decide it was time for a new album as opposed to another mixtape?</p>

<p>I would say because, you know, mixtapes are what I've done. I obviously have a lot more mixtapes than I do albums, and I just had been gone for so long. It was like two and a half years, and I think I did (mixtape) "It's Better This Way" and "#12FOR12," which was also pretty much a mixtape, too. But I just didn't think a tape was how I needed to start off.</p>

<p>In the end, I had been recording so many songs, and I think it was also just that time for me where I really wanted to do a double album. I'd always wanted to do one. I think I actually wanted "Live from the Underground" (his 2012 album) to be one, but we just couldn't, just with the label and budgets and stuff.</p>

<p>So this one, I was like, "I'm free. I can do exactly what I want to." We decided to make it a double. I've always had a hard time sequencing records because I'd have the trunk-rattling, aggressive car-slab music, and then I'd have a song that was more pertaining to how I was feeling at the time, maybe like "The Vent" or something like that, where it breaks up the entire album. It's like an abrupt stop sonically on the low, so it was like, "Well, how do I raise people's spirits again?"</p>

<p>With this album, I decided to really tell my story, the duality of me. On one album, I could go be super hip-hop, rapper, superhero vibe, and then the Justin Scott side could be how I feel at home. It could have those elements of, sometimes, the insecurity, the doubt, the depression, the anxiety, but how I keep my faith together in a record like "Mixed Messages," where sometimes we all have confusing messages that we send out.</p>

<p>It's a blessing because I think we're at a place where everyone is starting to realize that there's a lot going on in society, a lot of social topics, and the presidential aspect. There's just so much going on. It gave me the opportunity to speak my truth, and people were ready to embrace it. It's been an amazing journey thus far.</p>

<p>When you have that defined split in terms of tone and lyrics, how do you also communicate that duality in the music?</p>

<p>Thank God that I actually produce, too, because sonically I could tell off the bat what made more sense. A record like "Drinking Sessions," being so stripped-down and the piano chords and the blues horns, ... the elements of that record sounded like "Justin Scott" to me. It didn't necessarily sound like hip-hop. It sounded like something else.</p>

<p>Even the intro to "Justin Scott," and I worked with DJ Khalil on that record, and it was important that I didn't rap on it because when I'm at home, as a music lover, I just love soul music, so I play records that I have nothing to do with and just vibe out. I wanted that to kind of (show) how I listen to music at home.</p>

<p>A lot of people don't even realize that I sampled the "Justin Scott" intro for the "Big K.R.I.T." intro and then rap on the "Big K.R.I.T." intro because that's what I do. That's what people know me for.</p>

<p>But just sonically, "Price of Fame" would not have worked on the "Big K.R.I.T." side. "Mixed Messages" would not have worked on the "Big K.R.I.T." side because it would have diluted everything on that side had it been on it. But it makes so much sense on the "Justin Scott" side because it's more vulnerable. It's the transparent part of me.</p>

<p>And I've always been this way, but you put that face on, that mask on, to go out in the world and be able to deal with the negativity and to try to embrace positivity. Then, you get back home and deal with all that. There might be one comment while you're at home, and it makes you question everything.</p>

<p>When you're putting not just your name as an artist but your name as a person on the album, you're kind of saying, "This represents all of me." Was that difficult for you?</p>

<p>Yeah, just a tad bit because you still leave yourself out there people to be like, "Mm, I don't like that vibe, and mm, I don't like that vibe. I would rather you rap about candy-paint (metallic finish) and cars," you know what I'm saying?" [Laughs] Like, "Oh, no. We don't want to be sad." ... But I think about a lot of old-school artists. I think about the Bobby Womacks, the Curtis Mayfields, Al Green, Willie Hutch and all these people. When they were doing these songs, I don't think they were much concerned about what people think about the songs as much as, "I have to tell you about this. I have to speak on this."</p>

<p>I had to look at it from that perspective. If people don't get it now, then maybe when they're 40, 50, 60—Lord willing, people still listen to my music—they'll go back and something will resonate with them. That's what timeless music is. And I have to grow as an artist.</p>

<p>If the people who listen to me aren't there yet ... or maybe don't recognize anxiety yet, or maybe they feel like they're not abusing their vice or they don't understand what that may be doing to them, then maybe when they do get to that point, my song will make more sense, and it'll be helpful to them to know, "I went through it, too. I understand, and we can relate."</p>

<p>Once I started to look at it from that perspective, it made it so much easier to put my government name on my album. But it's also made it easy to do interviews. We have conversations like this, and like a lot of the radio people that I've talked to, they've also gone through depression. The room opens up, and we start having conversations that aren't surface, you know? It's a beautiful experience, man.</p>

<p>Your fans might recognize the connection between the titles of "4eva Is a Mighty Long Time" and several of your past releases, including "Return of 4eva" and "4eva N a Day." What's the reason for that?</p>

<p>Well, all of my albums have a story I'm telling, and I have no idea how it's going to end. [Laughs] But it started with "K.R.I.T. Wuz Here" (his 2010 album) even, that idea of more of an alien perspective or a being somewhere, and letting people know that I've been there, I've done this, or I'm a part of this whether you realize it or not. Then, going to "Return of 4Eva," and that having still more of an outer-space experience to it, trying to take people somewhere.</p>

<p>I think some of that comes with me being from Meridian, Mississippi, and sometimes feeling so much like an outsider. I always felt like I needed to bring people to where I was from and having this more outcast, alien perspective when I do go out, because I know that, "OK. People may not be as familiar with where I'm from or have never been. I've got to take them there."</p>

<p>And you know, I love sci-fi. I think outer space is the only place we all look at in awe, the stars and the planets, and there's just this mystery behind it.</p>

<p>So creating my albums, even "4eva Is a Mighty Long Time," I'm still giving it that space where it fits with "Return of 4eva" and fits with "4eva N a Day," which was the first (release) where I really showed people that I had two sides—that album cover with the little boy, the church being on the left side and a strip club on the right, the Bible on his left but the bottle on the right, and having to deal with that.</p>

<p>So I've always been putting that in my music. I just think this is the first time I could materialize it with two different albums and really be playing with exactly what the album is about and even show it with the album cover.</p>

<p>I've never been the type of person to put my face on album covers, so this was the first time that I was like, "No, I have to put my face. I have to show the energy and how it's different."</p>

<p>This is also your first release through your label, Multi Alumni. What was the experience like having to be both an artist and an executive on this album?</p>

<p>Scary! [Laughs] It was scary at first because it's the realization, "Ooh, the ball is in your court now," you know? But having the strong team that I have, my manager (Sheldon "Dutch" John) and (Steven "Steve-O" Brown of public-relations company GFCNY) on the marketing level, definitely helped.</p>

<p>These are people that I've been working with for years, and (they) have a really good understanding of what my vision has always been for my music and how to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>I've been branding Multi since 2005, right? But it's one of those things where 2010 is where we really started, and even when I was signed to Def Jam, I never stopped screaming Multi and never stopped building what that meant. If anything, that was something I had the opportunity to do while signed to a major (label) was continuously putting my brand at the forefront.</p>

<p>So once we left Def Jam, Multi was still there and active, and people know that it's not just about me, but it's about being a king or queen of whatever you do, and having to multi-task and play more than one position in life to ensure your success.</p>

<p>The fact that I produce, and I rap, and I can mix my own records and (engineer) my own records, it put me in a position where I could survive off music longer than most. And then, it puts us in a boss situation where I'll never sign as an artist (on another label). It can only be partnerships from this point on because now I have Multi.</p>

<p>Why did you decide to go through the process of launching Multi Alumni instead of trying to shop the album out to have another major record label to release it?</p>

<p>Well, we went through BMG (Rights Management for distribution), but the thing about the label, in most cases, is the way that you create music having a mind for business is very important because business can get in the way.</p>

<p>It can really affect how you are in the studio, affect the music or affect how you record. Even your delivery on a song can be affected by the people in the room and what they may be looking for.</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time sitting down in a boardroom, playing my album for people and hoping that they got it. If they didn't get it, then you're kind of fighting an uphill battle at that point, you know? This is the first album where I just (said), "This is the album. Let's go."</p>

<p>It's not where you have to play it for a lot of people, and they go, "Well, this is going to be the single." I was like, "No. This is the single. These are the videos. This is the album cover. This is how it looks, and this is the feel. Let's go." And even better, it was like, "This is the date. This is when we drop it."</p>

<p>It just was a freedom where it's so crazy because I'm so used to always working. The deadlines are usually so short that you work clean up until the deadline, and then, you go on tour immediately.</p>

<p>This is the first time where I was done with the album, everything was getting pressed, everything was working, and I was like, "So what am I supposed to do? What do you need me to do?" I'm asking my manager who's like, "Just chill! I don't need nothing from you!" [Laughs]</p>

<p>What have you learned since putting out your last album, "Cadillactica," in 2014 that you wanted to apply to "4eva"?</p>

<p>Man, life—I started living a little more. I spend so much time in the studio, man, that I really wasn't going outside and just enjoying nature and wherever I was at and actually being in the moment.</p>

<p>I was always thinking about the next song. I was always thinking about the next move and musically what I could do differently, and trying to compete and chase accolades ... in between "Cadillactica," that tour, getting off the label and what that meant and felt like, almost going to a point where people almost forgot about me.</p>

<p>You know, I pretty much went broke doing the album because I was investing all my money into it without the label knowing. I wanted to finish it without asking for any budget or anything. And man, I realized that money doesn't make you happy, and I realized that I had been abusing my vice in different ways.</p>

<p>That was affecting my emotions and the people around me. And my lady (neo-soul artist and singer-songwriter Mara Hruby) was a very impactful person in my life because she would get me out of the studio, get me out of the house, and we'd go experience things, and we'd travel.</p>

<p>It just helped with getting back in the studio and helped with writing and being more vulnerable on songs when, normally, I would try to kind of deal with whatever I was dealing with in life and not write about it. But I definitely put it all in this album. "Drinking Sessions," I was going through something the day that I wrote that, and I recorded it as it was. People can hear it and feel that I was being genuine.</p>

<p>Even without chasing the accolades, "4eva" peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard 200, No. 5 on the R&amp;B/hip-hop albums chart, No. 4 on the rap albums chart and No. 2 on the independent albums chart. What was it like to see that kind of impact after working on it for so long?</p>

<p>It means that people still want to hear my music. It means that I wasn't wrong about taking this route, the road less traveled. It paid off. It builds a certain amount of confidence that people, you know, can always expect me to do my best and always try to grow and to not conform and fit into whatever the latest trend might be, either.</p>

<p>People don't necessarily come to me or listen to my music for that. I think they enjoy that I'm going to give them something a little different.</p>

<p>(It shows) that you can be 100-percent yourself and still crack those numbers, still get the radio support and still do the radio interviews and be able to perform onstage with other artists, get the tours and all that by just being yourself without having to be (about) the shock value.</p>

<p>The 2018 legislative session's story largely revolves around Republicans' inability to get a lot done due to failed negotiations between the House and the Senate. While a laundry list of bills died this session, lawmakers did manage to fund some critical needs in the state—albeit partially due to lawsuits filed against the state. The state's crime lab, foster-care system and the Department of Mental Health all remained either intact or received more funding to continue operations, and hopefully fend off additional litigation.</p>

<p>We applaud lawmakers for understanding the gravity of using taxpayer dollars to fend off lawsuits—that is, until they passed the 15-week abortion ban this session. Beyond passing that unnecessary law, which will cost taxpayer dollars to defend in federal court, lawmakers neglected several other critical needs this session. For example, infrastructure funding, which they claimed to be their focus at the start of this year, went nowhere.</p>

<p>The House passed several road and bridge measures in January, but the lieutenant governor did not respond or even act on them, opting to introduce his own plan in mid-February instead. Discussions seemed limited until deadlines began to close in, and then it all crumbled. Never mind the fact that both the House and Senate plans come nowhere close to the Mississippi Economic Council's recommendation of $375 million needed annually to restore the state's infrastructure. Reeves' plan claimed to be a "billion dollar" infrastructure plan, but large parts of that would just shift existing revenue for the Mississippi Department of Transportation or force municipalities to come up with more money.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the House plan might have reached the MEC recommendation if all the measures had passed together—and state tax-revenue collections did amazingly well in the next few years, which remains to be seen after all those tax cuts. What really needs to happen is a dialogue about raising the state's gas tax, which is as flat as ever, but with Republicans like Reeves up for re-election next year, that conversation is out of the question. Mississippians will have to wait until 2019 to voice their opinions at the ballot box about roads and bridges, with the knowledge that a supermajority doesn't necessarily mean productivity on the issue.</p>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore implemented a downtown foot-patrol unit effective April 2, 2018, to foster positive policing relationships and offer prompt police assistance when necessary. He is pictured here at a previous press conference. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Jackson Police Department will implement a foot-patrol unit in downtown Jackson beginning Monday, April 2, under Interim Chief Anthony Moore's direction.</p>

<p>Sgt. Roderick Holmes, public information officer for JPD, told the Jackson Free Press that the department has had these units in the past, and it is something Moore wants to re-implement beginning in the downtown area. Holmes said the idea is to foster a police presence for crime deterrence, but to also create a positive policing relationship in a place many people frequent during the day.</p>

<p>"We have a lot of people obviously that live downtown, work downtown, and a lot of people that come from other parts of state, if not the country, and actually visit downtown," Holmes said. "So it's a pretty active and pretty pedestrian-oriented location within the city."</p>

<p>This downtown unit will work Monday through Friday during normal business hours when downtown Jackson is busiest, Holmes said, and in the future JPD hopes to include patrol bicycles. Holmes said JPD wants to implement foot patrols in other areas of the city, but at the present time, the department does not have the manpower to do so.</p>

<p>"The more officers you have, the more you can actually do, and the more emphasis you can put in certain areas," Holmes said. "Manpower does play a role or does have an impact on everything that we do here."</p>

<p>Holmes estimates that JPD currently has 350 sworn officers, give or take a few, and in the past, it has had as many as 500 officers. JPD is currently recruiting for a new class, and Holmes said that process is going well so far.</p>

<p>This new downtown unit comes less than a week after a Greenbrook Flowers experienced a series of break-ins. The owner, Gwen Dearman, says one man caused thousands of dollars worth of damage with at least five break-ins over the course of a week. On March 27, she told the Jackson City Council that the man was "stealing us blind" and had broken into the shop three times one Sunday alone.</p>

<p>Dearman pleaded with the council to do something to secure downtown, especially because her family's business has been on State Street since the 1960s and in Jackson for far longer than that.</p>

<p>"This is the reason people are leaving Jackson," Dearman said. "We have been here over 100 years ... and we want to stay. We love Jackson, but we can't afford to stay here if we keep being robbed this way."</p>

<p>Holmes said this new unit, announced two days after Dearman spoke in front of the council with members of JPD in attendance, is not a direct response to the Greenbrook break-ins. However, he hopes it will create relationships and also opportunity for people to contact an officer quickly if need be.</p>

<p>"If (people) see an officer out and about, by all means don't hesitate to interact with that officer," Holmes said. "[I]f they have any questions or anything whether it's law-related or otherwise, feel free to ask an officer."</p>
