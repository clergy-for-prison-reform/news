<h2 id="insidefamilydetentiontrumpsbigsolution">Inside Family Detention, Trump's Big Solution</h2>

<p>The administration is no longer separating</p>

<p>them. Now more parents and children</p>

<p>will be held at places like this.</p>

<p>At first glance, it resembles a doctor’s office, or perhaps a rec center. Security footage depicts sterile gray hallways leading to common areas with office couches and rainbow-colored, child-sized chairs. At the door to an outdoor field, there are tricycles and assorted balls, and in a small chapel with wooden benches, a detainee sweeps the floor. Correctional officers, referred to as “residential counselors,” sport khakis and blue polo shirts.</p>

<p>But the Berks Family Residential Center, located about 75 miles northwest of Philadelphia, is also a place where immigrant parents and children are held for indefinite periods of time without adequate healthcare, according to multiple complaints and lawsuits. In one 2016 case, a guard there was convicted of “institutional” sexual assault; his victim was a 19-year-old asylum seeker from Honduras who had been detained with her three-year-old son for 7 months.</p>

<p>It is facilities like Berks — operating in a gray area between federal prison and childcare provider — that may begin to sprout up across the country following President Trump’s announcement on Wednesday that he will end his administration’s practice of forcibly separating migrant parents and children at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

<p>“We are going to keep the families together,” Trump said, at a signing ceremony in the Oval Office for his executive order.</p>

<p>Framed as a solution to a political and humanitarian problem, the document specifically instructs the Department of Homeland Security to identify or build detention centers, like Berks, capable of detaining whole families while their immigration cases are decided.</p>

<p>The diaspora of detained immigrants in the U.S. includes unaccompanied minors in a variety of facilities — soon to include barracks at four military bases — or foster care; men and women applying for protection and held without their children in adult detention; and others funneled into the criminal justice system and incarcerated in federal prisons.</p>

<p>More than 2,500 immigrant parents and children, meanwhile, are held together in three family detention centers run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which have a total capacity of under 3,500. (The other two are in Texas.) Given that 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 adults over just a one-month period recently, more of these facilities will likely be necessary to accommodate Trump’s latest plan.</p>

<p>These are excerpts from more than 19 hours of security footage, captured in 2014 and obtained from a guard in a sexual assault case at the Berks Family Residential Center in Leesport, Pa.</p>

<p>The average length of stay for families detained in 2017 was 58 days, according to data released by ICE under the Freedom of Information Act. But some have been locked up for almost two years, according to their attorneys.</p>

<p>Migrant families have been on this seesaw before.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, it was often the federal government’s practice to send parents to detention facilities and their children to shelters and foster homes, effectively separating them. When Congress discovered this was happening, in 2006, it directed the Department of Homeland Security to instead keep families together, in less penal, more domestic settings.</p>

<p>But what DHS came up with — a guarded, fenced-in, former medium-security prison operated by Corrections Corporation of America called the T. Don Hutto Family Residential Facility — wasn’t exactly homelike. In response to public outcry, the Obama administration decided in 2009 to end family detention at Hutto, which was soon repurposed as a facility for women only. Berks remained open.</p>

<p>Then, after an influx of tens of thousands of families arrived at the border in 2014 due to severe gang violence in Central America, family detention made a comeback. Facilities in Dilley and Karnes, Texas, were opened — and the national capacity for parents and children locked up together was greater than at any time since Japanese internment.</p>

<p>In 2015, a federal court ordered ICE to release children with their mothers under an existing Department of Justice legal agreement, called the Flores settlement, requiring that kids be held in the least restrictive settings for no more than 20 days.</p>

<p>Yet under that ruling, the government can still detain parents. The Trump administration said Thursday that it therefore had no option — if separation was no longer politically or morally feasible — but to hold children in the same facilities. It filed a request to modify the Flores agreement so that family detention would not be subject to the 20-day rule or to licensing standards.</p>

<p>Berks has already evaded the Flores settlement, as it had a childcare license. The certification was not renewed in 2016, but the county has appealed that decision, leaving the facility open and in limbo.</p>

<p>The Next To Die </p>

<p>Because of this, families often spend no more than 20 days in one of the Texas detention centers but then are moved to Berks for indefinite periods of time.</p>

<p>Jacquelyn M. Kline, whose law firm has represented families at Berks, described poor medical care and multiple cases of abuse or neglect. “We had a young girl who was throwing up blood for days, babies who were so dehydrated they had to be taken to the ER,” she said.</p>

<p>According to Kline, guards at the facility perform constant bed-checks while the mothers and children are sleeping. “Imagine every night for two years you’re woken up with a flashlight every 15 minutes.”</p>

<p>Carol Anne Donahue, a lawyer who worked as a substitute teacher at Berks from 2004 to 2007 and now represents families there, said that “we have a statement by a mom saying the staff member would give her daughter candy and ask her to take her hair down and dance for him.”</p>

<p>Both lawyers filed multiple claims with Berks and ICE. Donahue received an email from Berks promising an investigation of the staff member, who still works there.</p>

<p>Supporters of family detention counter that it is far more humane than separation, and is also the next-best way of deterring parents and kids from continuing to flood across the border from Central America.</p>

<p>In an emailed response to the allegations made by Berks detainees, an ICE spokeswoman pointed to a 2017 report by the DHS inspector general stating that family residential centers are “clean, well-organized, and efficiently run,” with playrooms, social workers, and educational services. She also said the agency has zero tolerance for all forms of sexual abuse, that all detainees receive a comprehensive physical exam within two weeks of their arrival, and that if there is a male head of household with a female child, they are roomed separately from other family units and always within the staff’s line of sight.</p>

<p>Gladys, who asked that her last name be withheld for her privacy, was detained at Berks for over a year with her two-year-old daughter, from 2015 to 2016. They shared a room with two other families, enduring the nightly flashlight checks.</p>

<p>Gladys described substandard medical attention when her daughter was vomiting blood for months. She also witnessed a guard kissing a detainee, and reported it to staff.</p>

<p>But the authorities already knew about the relationship, she said, and just laughed. (This was the same guard later convicted institutional sexual assault of a detainee.)</p>

<p>With the example of Berks in mind, opponents of family detention insist that President Trump’s return to it now is just another way to keep doing irreparable harm to parents and children. These facilities are remote, with little access to legal services or family support. Berks is county-run and has been licensed, while the two Texas detention centers are unlicensed and privately operated by CoreCivic and The GEO Group.</p>

<p>Releasing immigrants who have not committed other crimes on parole or bond, potentially with an ankle bracelet, would be far more humane, the critics say. It has also proven to be just as effective in the past. Under ICE’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program, which included telephone check-ups, in-person visits, and GPS monitoring, the appearance rate for immigration court proceedings was over 99 percent, according to 2013 data.</p>

<p>Jasmine Rivera, an organizer of the Shut Down Berks campaign, said Trump’s decision was “the bait and switch — make people freak out over family separation in order to normalize family detention.”</p>

<p>One of the many reasons she and other advocates call family detention immoral: reports by human rights groups that at Berks, children who misbehave are threatened with separation from their parents.</p>

<h2 id="isurvivedaviolentcrimethenthejusticesystemletmedown">I Survived a Violent Crime, Then the Justice System Let Me Down</h2>

<p>by: Patricia Wenskunas</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/06/21/i-survived-a-violent-crime-then-the-justice-system-let-me-down </p>

<p>"I was made to feel like a second-class victim." </p>

<p>It was an April morning when my personal trainer came into my home in Irvine, California, to take a look at the treadmill I’d been planning to sell.</p>

<p>Then he gave me this pill, this little yellow “weight loss” pill, and a chocolate drink.</p>

<p>“What is this?” I asked. “There’s something blue in the drink.”</p>

<p>He was like, “Oh, don’t worry about it. It’s probably something in the cup…”</p>

<p>I don’t remember much of the next half hour, but do remember vividly what I felt next: I was undressed and in my son’s bed. I couldn’t get words out of my mouth. I felt like I was under anesthesia.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, my trainer had wrapped my face and head in Saran wrap and was beating me and smashing my head into the wall. He was screaming that he was going to kill me and my son, Nathaniel, who was 12 at the time but, mercifully, wasn’t in the house.</p>

<p>“Listen, I’ll give you sex,” I remember saying. “I’ll give you money. I’ll give you whatever you want. But please don’t kill my baby…”</p>

<p>I don’t know if I jumped, if I fell, if he pushed me — I have no idea — but eventually I went over my 12-foot second-floor railing. I landed in the kitchen, and was able to get out the door and run to my neighbor’s house to call 911. And then the police showed up along with the paramedics.</p>

<p>At the end of the night, they dropped me off at my friend’s house, and my friend and his wife were standing at the door. They say they'll never forget how I looked.</p>

<p>I have blue eyes, but they say that when they saw me that evening, my eyes looked black — as if my soul had left my body.</p>

<p>On that night in 2002, my personal trainer did not murder me. There was also no evidence that he raped me. He didn’t steal anything of value from my house, nor were any drugs found in my system other than allergy medication.</p>

<p>Because of all these things, the prosecutor in my case didn’t pursue the most serious charges against my assailant, and the judge made me feel like some kind of second-class victim.</p>

<p>I remember, at one point, the DA showing me a blown-up picture of a bloody knife (from one of his murder cases) and saying, “You should take your son to the pumpkin patch. You should go live your life. You survived. I have other cases in which the victims were murdered, and they’re no longer here.”</p>

<p>I told him, “I wish I would’ve been murdered, because maybe there would be justice in this case.” Obviously I didn’t feel that way, or don’t feel that way now, but that’s what I remember saying.</p>

<p>My first interactions with the system, especially the police, had actually led me to believe that I’d be treated with great respect.</p>

<p>Yes, I had to do a rape kit, which is invasive, and have photos taken of my body multiple times, and get asked all sorts of questions. But the investigator, the detective in my case, treated me with real dignity. I felt like: Someone’s standing up for me, someone’s protecting me, there’s going to be justice.</p>

<p>I remember hearing him in the hallway, when I was in the emergency room, talking to another officer and saying, “I’m supposed to go to the movies with my wife... You know I was looking forward to that popcorn… But you know what, I think this victim needs me more…”</p>

<p>And when they questioned me, they said, “You know, Patricia. These are going to be some very difficult questions that we have to ask you. It’s going to sound like we’re doubting or blaming or questioning you, but we’re not. We just need to ask these questions so that we can ensure we get an arrest and a prosecution in this case.”</p>

<p>Then the court system happened.</p>

<p>One day, I got a call from an officially-appointed victim advocate saying, “Patricia, you need to get to court right away.”</p>

<p>I got dressed and quickly made my way to the courthouse, where, upon arriving in a courtroom, I heard, “Okay, sentencing will be…”</p>

<p>I looked at the advocate and asked, “What just happened?” I hadn’t been told anything about any of this.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t worry about it, Patricia,” she replied. “He admitted to doing everything to you. He signed on the dotted line. And the District Attorney decided to take a two-year plea agreement, so he’s going to do two years.”</p>

<p>All I remember next is getting up, going out to the corridor, and throwing up.</p>

<p>I couldn’t understand or even fathom what had happened — it seemed to be the opposite of how the police had treated me. This man had tried to kill me, threatened to kill my son, and he’s just going to “do two years”? I just kept thinking, That’s not how it happens on TV. If he gets away with this, he’s going to kill someone else, or he’s going to come back and kill me and my son…</p>

<p>So I decided to picket the courthouse, gathering a bunch of friends and holding signs up out in the parking lot.</p>

<p>At the next hearing, when the sentencing was going to be officially pronounced, the judge looked at the DA and said, “Well, your victim is here today. She doesn’t like you, she doesn’t like me. She doesn’t like your plea deal. And she’s picketing my courthouse. So if she wants a trial, let’s give her a trial. I’m going to throw out this plea deal and give the defendant a chance at trial.”</p>

<p>But the judge threw out the attempted murder charge, and the jury could only find my personal trainer guilty of misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon and criminal threats. So he ended up getting only 120 days in jail. And five years of anger management and five years of probation.</p>

<p>Then came restitution, the part of a criminal case when the perpetrator is supposed to make the victim (at least financially) whole.</p>

<p>When I went to provide all my receipts, all my documentation of what I’d spent out of my own pocket because of this crime, the judge scoffed, “You’re expecting him to pay for your bed and your sheets and your pillow? Why would I award that?”</p>

<p>“Because he attacked me in my bed. I couldn’t keep the mattress, the box spring, the sheets, the pillows. I couldn’t sleep there. I threw them in the trash, and I relocated.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to honor that,” she said. (Editor's note: California only awards restitution for stolen, damaged or destroyed property, but not long after, the same judge was permanently barred from courtrooms after a state commission determined she had been “abusive and demeaning” to defendants, attorneys, witnesses and prospective jurors.)</p>

<p>I think out of approximately $54,000 that I’d spent, including moving into a new home because I was so traumatized, I probably got back about $800 total over the years.</p>

<p>I’ll never forget the first restitution check I actually received… for $54. I remember being in my car at my storage unit, opening up the envelope, thinking: What is this? Then I realized what it was and actually ripped the check halfway in half before I sat there and cried.</p>

<p>I put the ripped check on my dashboard. It sat there for maybe two weeks.</p>

<p>I was so naïve during my court case, much more so than I am today. Surely he’s going to go to prison for the rest of his life, I thought. Surely justice was going to make me whole again.</p>

<p>But if they don’t want to see me as a victim, I won’t either. I’ll be a survivor and thrive.</p>

<h2 id="yourlovedonediestheprisonleavesavoicemail">Your Loved One Dies. The Prison Leaves a Voicemail.</h2>

<p>by: Christie Thompson</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/06/21/your-loved-one-dies-the-prison-leaves-a-voicemail </p>

<p>Early one morning in April 2016, Linda Reza was at work at a fabric sample factory in Ontario, California, when she got a call from an unknown number. She wasn’t supposed to use her phone at work, so she slipped out to the bathroom to check her voicemail.</p>

<p>“Yes, hello, this message is for Linda Reza, stepmother of inmate Rocha, Erika, here at California Institution for Women,” said the caller, who identified himself as a lieutenant at the Chino, California, prison. “It is imperative that you contact the facility as soon as possible. We have some information relative to your stepdaughter’s demise.” Before hanging up, the man added, “We’re deeply sorry ma’am ... you have our extended sympathy for your loss.”</p>

<p>Reza was floored; this was the first she had heard about her stepdaughter’s death. Crying and in shock, she dialed the number back. The lieutenant answered, and told her that guards had found Rocha the night before, hanging in her cell.</p>

<p>Prison officials left a voicemail for Linda Reza informing her that her stepdaughter, Erika Rocha, had died. Emily Berl for The Marshall Project</p>

<p>“That voicemail is traumatizing,” Reza said in a recent interview, though she can’t bring herself to delete the message. “I still find myself driving home from work at times crying, pissed off, and I think, through a voicemail? Really, you jackasses, through a voicemail?”</p>

<p>Experts say the least traumatic way to inform people of the death of a loved one is to do it gently and in person. When military prisoners die, they are treated the same as other service members: A chaplain and a designated “notification officer” visit the family at home to inform them, often sitting with them while they absorb the news. The same process is used by most police departments with families of crime victims.</p>

<p>But when someone dies in prison, there’s no such procedure. In many situations, closest relatives are informed of loved ones’ deaths through voicemails, text messages and letters, according to advocates and families of incarcerated people. It can take days or weeks for them to find out. Families say the way they were notified ends up being the searing, specific detail that pains them long after their loved one is buried.</p>

<p>Erika Rocha committed suicide at the California Institution for Women in April 2016.</p>

<p>In some cases, families aren’t notified at all. The California Department of Corrections settled a lawsuit in 2016 out of Sacramento, where officials at Mule Creek State Prison never contacted inmate Joseph Duran’s family about his death. His parents only learned he had died when a Sacramento Bee reporter called and informed them, months later. By then, a nearby funeral home had already cremated Duran’s body and scattered his ashes off the coast of Marin County, which went against the family’s Catholic beliefs.</p>

<p>Bill Sessa, a spokesperson for the CDCR, said he could not comment on specific cases. “We recognize the importance of being sensitive in these situations, and we fully understand it is a difficult time for the family,” he wrote in an email. “Our goal is to communicate with the person’s next-of-kin as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>Death notification policies vary among corrections departments. Many states, including Texas, New York, Florida, and the District of Columbia, have a prison chaplain deliver the news. It most often takes place over the phone, or through a letter, if someone can’t be reached. In the federal Bureau of Prisons, a warden or chaplain makes the call, followed by a “letter of condolence.”</p>

<p>In California — where 334 inmates died in 2016 — a warden, lieutenant or counselor should use “all reasonable means” to contact family members, according to the corrections department policy. The policy includes a script, which opens with “I regret to inform you,” and says that the remains have been released to a mortuary and must be claimed within 48 hours or “disposition must be made as provided by law.” The script ends with, “We extend our sympathy in your loss.”</p>

<p>CDCR spokesperson Sessa said in-person notification would be preferable, but a phone call is often more practical because of the distance and need to inform families quickly. Though there isn’t a designated person to deliver the news, he said it is often done by someone with years of experience who knows how to handle the situation sensitively. California’s policy was created in the 1990s and has been revised several times “to focus on notifying the family of the death without compromising health privacy laws or security,” he said.</p>

<p>But several inmates’ families said that a hurried phone call or terse letter felt like a symbol of how the system viewed their sibling, parent or child and, by extension, them. “This is one of the first things I hear about [from clients],” said Lori Rifkin, an Emeryville, California, attorney who has handled numerous wrongful death lawsuits for families whose loved ones died in jail or prison. (She is representing Rocha’s family, including Reza, in its lawsuit against CDCR, which claims the prison failed to provide proper mental health care.) “They want to tell the story and how harmful [the notification] was, and there’s no legal claim for that. It ends up being the thing that they’re never able to feel like they get a hearing on.”</p>

<p>Now, a group of advocates is lobbying lawmakers to change the state’s policy and ensure that families are dealt with more delicately. “There has to be a gentler, more humane way of letting them know,” said Romarilyn Ralston of the California Coalition for Women Prisoners, a San Francisco-based organization of prisoners’ family members and formerly incarcerated people.</p>

<p>The Next To Die </p>

<p>Advocates say telling people in person would be ideal, but acknowledge that would be difficult to implement and hard to sell to policymakers and officials. Even small changes to the state’s policy, they say, could make it more considerate.</p>

<p>For example, the Coalition says the state’s script should start by asking family members if they’re in a safe place to talk about sensitive information — that way no one would find out about the death of a loved one while stuck in traffic or in the middle of their office. Euphemistic words like “remains” or “disposition” should be replaced by clearer language, like “body” and “release.” And no one should find out through a voicemail.</p>

<p>Advocates tried and failed to change this language through the state legislature. Instead, they’re continuing to speak with lawmakers, as well as corrections officials and other stakeholders, to raise awareness of this rarely discussed issue. It’s part of a larger effort to improve mental health care within California state prisons, which saw a recent increase in suicide among incarcerated women.</p>

<p>Short of rewriting the script for death notification, state Sen. Connie Leyva, a Democrat from Chino, is trying to change the guidelines around informing families of serious incidents, after speaking with advocates for the Coalition. According to the current policy, family members should be contacted in the case of serious illness or injury, but many say that rarely happens.</p>

<p>Terri Sunday said her daughter Amber Williams has attempted suicide multiple times and, most recently, was attacked by another prisoner at the Central California Women’s Facility, in Chowchilla, California. Sunday said she was never called, and found out instead through letters and emails from other inmates. “Everything is secretive,” Sunday said. “I’ve been dealing with the prison for 20 years, and I’m still stonewalled at every turn.”</p>

<p>CDCR spokesperson Sessa said he could not comment on an individual’s medical information, but that families are informed if there is an “imminent threat of death.” The decision to contact next-of-kin is made by medical staff and not correctional officers, he said.</p>

<p>Leyva has introduced a bill that would require California prison officials to tell families about suicide attempts, serious illness, injury, and deaths within 24 hours, as part of a larger bill mandating that they report to the state legislature on their efforts to prevent suicide. Under the current policy, there is no time limit to make these notifications, and families are not informed about suicide attempts.</p>

<p>“It’s critical that we let families know. It’s just a matter of respect,” Sen. Leyva said. “I think sometimes people forget that they’re dealing with someone’s loved one. Being a mom myself, I can’t imagine not knowing for weeks what happened to my child.” Leyva’s bill passed the state senate in late May, and is now being considered by the state assembly.</p>

<p>It took three days for California prison officials to tell Takis Kalatzakis that his son Dimitris was dead. He found out through a telegram, dropped at his house in San Jose, California, one Monday evening in 2013. According to Kalatzakis, the letter simply said that Dimitris had died and that Kalatzakis had 24 hours to claim his body. (CDCR policy states that families have 48 hours.) Kalatzakis would later find out that Dimitris had been beaten and strangled to death by his cellmate at Salinas Valley State Prison in Soledad, California.</p>

<p>Five years later, Kalatzakis still can’t believe how he learned about his son’s sudden, violent death. “I was in shock,” said Kalatzakis, who was alone when he received the telegram. While setting a 24-hour time limit for notification would help, he said, it doesn’t go far enough. “The way they told me is something I’m never going to forget. [It’s like] I’m nothing.”</p>

<h2 id="supremecourtdeclinestoheargaybiascase">Supreme Court Declines to Hear ‘Gay Bias’ Case</h2>

<p>by: Maurice Chammah</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-18</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/06/18/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-gay-bias-case </p>

<p>On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear arguments in the case of Charles Rhines, a South Dakota prisoner who claims he was sentenced to death in part because he is gay.</p>

<p>Rhines was convicted in 1993 of fatally stabbing 22-year-old Donnivan Schaeffer during a robbery in Rapid City. While jurors were deciding his punishment, at least one commented that Rhines might actually enjoy spending his life in prison among men. Defense lawyers argued that anti-gay bias helped send their client land to death row. The Marshall Project recently wrote about the case in-depth.</p>

<p>The court does not give reasons for rejecting a case, but an investigator for the South Dakota attorney general’s office interviewed jurors who did not recall these comments and said their decision was based on the crime itself and Rhines’ apparent lack of remorse.</p>

<p>The Record </p>

<p>Rhines’ lawyers argued that his experience was similar to other defendants whose jurors expressed racist sentiments. In recent rulings, the Supreme Court has ordered lower courts to reexamine convictions and sentences because of juror racial bias.</p>

<p>Shawn Nolan, who oversees Rhines’ defense team at the Federal Community Defender Office in Philadelphia, called sexual orientation “a natural next step.” The state argued that sexual minorities are not in need of the same protection from discrimination as racial minorities.</p>

<p>The justices’ decision to decline this case does not bar them from examining the issue in a different case in the future.</p>

<h2 id="vanjonesanswershiscritics">Van Jones Answers His Critics</h2>

<p>by: Justin George</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-17</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/06/18/van-jones-answers-his-critics </p>

<p>CNN commentator and host Van Jones has been involved with civil rights causes for years, including through #cut50, the organization he founded to advocate for slashing the nation’s incarcerated population in half.</p>

<p>But recently, he’s found himself under attack — being called a sellout and a sucker — for supporting a bill that would improve some conditions for the nation’s 185,000 federal prisoners. The First Step Act, which is co-sponsored by Democrat Hakeem Jeffries and Republican Doug Collins, passed the House overwhelmingly last month. It would make it illegal to shackle pregnant prisoners, release more infirmed or elderly prisoners, place inmates in facilities closer to their families, and increase the number of days inmates can spend in halfway houses or home confinement.</p>

<p>But plenty of people on the left are angry over what’s missing: There is no mention of decreasing stiff drug sentences, ending long sentences or giving judges more discretion. Opposition has come from groups like the ACLU and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which have historically advocated for better prisoner treatment. Some opponents worry that settling for this version of federal reform would hand Trump a victory — and shut down the possibility of more aggressive change in the future.</p>

<p>Jones, who hosts "The Van Jones Show," thinks they’re wrong, and he sat down with The Marshall Project to explain why. His answers have been edited for length and clarity.</p>

<p>How did #cut50 get involved in supporting the First Step Act?</p>

<p>Hakeem Jeffries is a hero of the justice community. I’ve been a huge fan and follower of his for a long time. I agree with him that we need a stable bipartisan consensus to undo mass incarceration. In order to get there, we have to break this logjam that existed under President Barack Obama and in Congress. When we had Obama in the White House and [former U.S. Attorneys] Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in the Department of Justice, we had a pretty robust bill that I fought tooth and nail to try to get passed. It had sentencing reform, prison reform, and every other kind of reform in there. In the fall of 2016, a bunch of people said, “Well, let's not pass this right now. The Democrats are going to have an epic victory. We'll have Hillary Clinton, more Democrats, and we can get an even better bill.” You see what happened. The lesson I learned from that was take the reform you can get when you can get it and keep going.</p>

<p>We improved the bill to the point where 80 grassroots groups could support it. And 70 percent of the Democratic caucus could support it. And 100 percent of the Democratic leadership, including Nancy Pelosi, could support it. The improvement process was something that might have even gone better had more people stuck it out the way we did.</p>

<p>Were you surprised to see some Democrats attack you?</p>

<p>No. I wasn't surprised because there are two different schools of thought in the progressive movement, and both have some validity. There's one school of thought that says, just from the door, “Do not engage with the Trump White House. They are racists and erratic and not trustworthy.” And then there's a different school, which is where I come from, which looks at the question a little bit more closely. There is a split in the Republican Party and the Trump White House between the pro-prison faction that [U.S. Attorney Jeff] Sessions represents and the pro-reform faction that people like Sen. Rand Paul represent, Rick Perry as Texas governor represent, Ohio Gov. John Kasich represents, and certainly White House senior advisor Jared Kushner.</p>

<p>The Record </p>

<p>Fielding attacks from Democrats is one thing, but there also seems to be a deeper layer of criticism. Supporting Jared Kushner’s agenda, to some, is tacit support for a Trump administration that has targeted or insulted people of color through rhetoric or policy. Did you feel that?</p>

<p>I don't think of African Americans as a monolith, and much more importantly, I wasn't the only African American who thought that the civil rights establishment had it wrong.</p>

<p>Don't forget the head of the Congressional Black Caucus, U.S. Rep. Cedric L. Richmond, a Louisiana Democrat, sided with Hakeem. U.S. Rep. and Democratic Party Deputy Chair Keith Ellison, as progressive an African American as you are going to find, sided with Hakeem. The Urban League sided with Hakeem. More importantly, Families Against Mandatory Minimums, plus 80 grassroots groups who are all dealing with actual day-to-day reentry issues and other challenges, sided with Hakeem. And now it's more than 100 groups.</p>

<p>It really became more of a split between some of the inside-the-Beltway organizations that have a particular worldview that is important, versus a lot of the grassroots groups who are really dealing on a daily basis with incarcerated people looking at the actual content of the bill. There were black people and white people on all sides of that.</p>

<p>So as somebody who has been frontline 25 years on criminal justice, you would want people to give you the benefit of the doubt. But if folks choose not to, that's just called democracy.</p>

<p>I get outraged when people like Topeka Sam, an African American woman who was incarcerated, brings a dozen formerly incarcerated women to the White House to advocate for reform and is attacked. I get outraged when Shaka Senghor, who did 19 years in prison and almost 10 years in solitary confinement, speaks up for the bill and gets attacked. On Facebook they were called sellouts, Uncle Toms. I don't think it's appropriate when formerly incarcerated African Americans are vilified this way.</p>

<p>Some say the First Step Act tears at the seams of a strong bipartisan coalition. Divided, that coalition won’t serve anyone’s interests because it won’t be able to get anything passed under Trump.</p>

<p>Where is this strong bipartisan coalition for sentencing reform? I know that they were able to get the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act out of committee in judiciary, which is good on the Senate side, but there is zero chance that that bill is going to be brought for a vote by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in its present form, and there’s not even a strategy to get McConnell to check it out, that I can tell. A lot of the Republicans do want sentencing reform, but they can't start there with a critical mass of their other colleagues.</p>

<p>I think that because this is one of the very few areas of bipartisan agreement, there will be multiple opportunities to come back again on criminal justice reform and to make progress.</p>

<p>Several senators have indicated that they will not support any criminal justice reform bill that doesn’t include ways to lessen mandatory minimum sentences. Was the First Step Act worth it?</p>

<p>I would love to see sentencing reform. Fought for it my whole life. Fought for it before it was popular. I just didn't understand why some people in the Senate want us to try to carry a camel through a keyhole in the House. If they have the votes to get sentencing reform in the Senate, God bless them. We couldn't find those votes in the House. We had to carry through the House what we could carry through the House. Nobody would be happier than me to see sentencing reform taken up by either chamber. But we had to get through the House what we could get through the House.</p>

<p>Here's the irony: If sentencing reform does now get taken up, or it's introduced as a part of the First Step Act, or there's some amalgamation between the two and something does get passed with sentencing reform in it, it will only get passed because we got something more modest through the House first.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s Trump policy. No, it’s not the law. </p>

<p>In an already contentious national debate over immigration, news of migrant children separated from their parents have raised questions for many about what's happening. Marshall Project contributing writer Julia Preston, who has covered immigration issues in Washington and on the border for years, offers some answers.</p>

<p>Are the recent separations of at least 2,000 children from their parents at the Mexican border the result of a Trump administration policy?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>On May 7, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced “important new enforcement policies” of “zero tolerance” at the border. The Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, which is in charge of border enforcement, began to refer any immigrant caught crossing without legal documents to the Department of Justice, to be prosecuted for a crime in federal court. As part of the new policy, parents who were criminally prosecuted were separated from their children.</p>

<p>“We are here to send a message to the world: we are not going to let this country be overwhelmed,” Sessions said, explaining the new approach. “If you cross this border unlawfully, then we will prosecute you. It’s that simple.”</p>

<p>So, illegal border crossers were not prosecuted previously?</p>

<p>Before the zero tolerance policy, most immigrants caught at the border were prosecuted for immigration violations in proceedings in immigration court, not in federal criminal court. Some were quickly deported. But many of the migrants coming from Central America (the majority of those apprehended in recent months) told border authorities they were afraid to return to their home countries and asked for asylum protection the United States. Most asylum-seekers were detained for some period. Many were released, to travel to places where their asylum claims would be heard in immigration courts around the country.</p>

<p>Since at least the administration of President George W. Bush, federal officials have used prosecution in federal criminal court as an extra punishment and deterrent for illegal border crossers, but only in limited regions of the border. It was one of several “consequences” DHS border authorities applied strategically, depending on the migrant flow at different border points. This is the first time federal criminal prosecution has been applied for all illegal border crossings.</p>

<p>Is it in fact a crime to cross the border illegally?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Entry without inspection by an immigration officer is a federal misdemeanor on the first offense, punishable by up to six months in prison. On the second offense it is a felony, with up to 2 years in prison. Returning to the United States illegally after deportation is also a felony.</p>

<p>Okay. So doesn’t the law require children to be separated from parents caught crossing illegally?</p>

<p>No, it doesn’t.</p>

<p>The surge in children separated from parents since May 7 is directly related to the Trump administration’s zero tolerance policy. This is convoluted, so bear with me.</p>

<p>Under that policy, parents apprehended at the border have been transferred from Customs and Border Protection, an agency that includes the Border Patrol and is part of DHS, into the custody of the United States Marshals Service. Those are the law enforcement officers who handle movements of people on trial in federal courts. The parents have been held in federal pre-trial detention.</p>

<p>Their children don’t go with them. When the parents and their children crossed the border, they were together, forming what DHS officials call a family unit. Under the new policy, when the parent is transferred to federal court, DHS officials are re-classifying their children as unaccompanied minors—the term for children who arrived at a United States border without a parent or legal guardian. The children are physically separated from their parents. They are sent to deportation proceedings in immigration court, separate from their parents. And, by law, DHS border officials are required within 72 hours to transfer the children to the custody of yet another federal agency: the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS. The children are held in shelters overseen by health officials, mostly administered by private contractors, which are closed to the public.</p>

<p>Can DHS officials just declare that a child who crossed the border with a parent now suddenly is unaccompanied, and separate them to be sent to HHS shelters?</p>

<p>Good question.</p>

<p>DHS officials say they have broad authority to make these determinations. But until the zero tolerance policy, DHS officials were identifying children as unaccompanied only if there was no parent or legal guardian with them “at the time of apprehension.”</p>

<p>The explicit intent of several laws and federal court rulings governing the handling of children at the border is that they should always be treated with special care. In general under American law, disrupting or severing the relationship between a child and their parent is a severe measure to be taken when less harsh alternatives are not available.</p>

<p>Well, are there alternatives? Didn’t the Obama administration separate families, too?</p>

<p>There are alternatives.</p>

<p>Before the zero tolerance policy of sending migrants to criminal court, parents and children who were in immigration proceedings were generally held together in detention centers specially equipped for families. There are two big centers in Texas and one in Berks County, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The Obama administration detained families, sometimes holding young children and their parents for long periods. However, after a ruling by a federal court in California in 2015, the families could not be held in those centers for longer than about three weeks, and they had to be released to fight their court cases free of detention. Under President Obama, separation of children from parents was rare, mostly limited to relatively few cases where parents were suspected of serious trafficking and other crimes.</p>

<p>Doesn’t the administration have to separate the families because of the Flores agreement? What is the Flores agreement anyway?</p>

<p>No, the Flores agreement does not require family separation.</p>

<p>The Flores agreement was a court settlement first reached in 1997, requiring immigration authorities to release children from immigration detention without unnecessary delay to parents or relatives. It was revised by the California court ruling in 2015, which required authorities to prioritize family reunification--not separation--and to release children and their parents as fast as possible and generally in no more than about three weeks.</p>

<p>Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said that family separation “is not a controversial idea” because the same thing would happen to an American accused of a crime. So is this so different?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>When people are arrested on federal charges, the police do not immediately, arbitrarily seize and detain their children and turn custody over to a federal agency.</p>

<p>So when do the parents get their children back?</p>

<p>In principle, when they finish in federal court. In practice, unclear.</p>

<p>Up to now, most of the parents are going through super-fast-track mass trials in federal courts, where they are pleading guilty to a misdemeanor and being sentenced to time served, often in as little as 48 hours for the whole trial. According to public defenders representing them in court, the parents are often frantic and desperate to be reunited with their children, and they agree to guilty pleas without fully understanding the consequences. After trial, the parents are sent back to DHS to be detained for immigration proceedings. As convicted criminals, they will almost certainly be deported.</p>

<p>Health Department officials, with hundreds of minors coming into their custody in just a few weeks, have not yet established clear procedures to reunite children with parents after trial. Parents are having great difficulty finding out where their children are or communicating with them.</p>

<p>Didn’t a lot of these parents want to apply for asylum?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Most of the families are running from three countries in Central America that have been overrun by vicious street gangs and other criminal organizations. Many say they fled when gangs tried to recruit their teenage boys or threatened sexual assault against their daughters. Women have faced an epidemic of sexual violence.</p>

<p>So did they file their asylum claims?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Under zero tolerance, Sessions and Nielsen have declared that anyone crossing without documents between border stations (in DHS-speak, “ports of entry”) will be subject to criminal prosecution for illegal entry. They are no longer allowing migrants to ask for asylum from Border Patrol agents in the field. Most of the asylum-seekers in the migrant wave since 2014 forded the Rio Grande river in Texas or crossed illegally through some other border region and turned themselves in to Border Patrol agents to ask for protection.</p>

<p>Nielsen said migrants seeking asylum should come to a border station to ask for protection, and if they did they would not be separated from their children.</p>

<p>It’s unclear what legal authority underpins this new distinction, and so far in practice border authorities have not applied it consistently. The American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit earlier this year on behalf of a Congolese migrant who came to a border station and was separated from her child anyway.</p>

<p>Why is the Trump administration insisting on separating children from their parents?</p>

<p>It depends on which official is speaking.</p>

<p>Steven Wagner, the Acting Assistant Secretary in charge of children and families at the Department of Health and Human Services, who oversees the shelter system, explained one goal in a telephonic media briefing on Tuesday.</p>

<p>“We expect the new policy will result in a deterrence effect,” Wagner said. “We certainly hope that parents stop bringing kids on this dangerous journey and entering the country illegally.”</p>

<p>Jerry called the day he got out of prison. He had just been released that afternoon, taken in handcuffs to a reentry center on Boston’s South Shore. He was told that the center could help him find a job and get treatment, but he stayed only a few minutes to get directions to the train. A white man in his 50s, Jerry returned to his neighborhood in South Boston to meet his father. He looked for the old man at the station and then tried calling him, feeding quarters into a pay phone. Unable to reach him, he went to a coffee shop to regroup. “I was at a Dunkin’ Donuts and threw an ice coffee into the trash and turned around and saw him,” he said. Jerry had been locked up for 19 years. “I was just standing there. I felt like a convict, holding my little bag. I felt like I escaped.”</p>

<p>I met Jerry through the Boston Reentry Study, a series of interviews my research team and I conducted with people leaving prison and returning to neighborhoods around Boston. Following 122 men and women through their first year after incarceration, we wanted to understand what happens when people return to a community, and the challenges faced by them and their families.</p>

<p>The first days and weeks after leaving prison can be filled with anxiety and loneliness. We called it “the stress of transition.” For some like Jerry, who had a history of drug problems and mental illness, the stress was acute and was associated with unemployment, unstable housing, and reincarceration months later.</p>

<p>Each step in the transition from prison to community is an opportunity for either social integration or isolation. Right at prison release, about half the people we interviewed were picked up from prison by family or friends. The rest set out on a more solitary path, delivered by a prison van to a train or reentry center, or just walking through the prison gates by themselves.</p>

<p>For some, the transition was marked by a welcome-home party. Welcome-home events were organized by mothers and siblings, with family and friends attending. But the parties were thrown more for those whose minds were sound and whose bodies were unravaged by drugs. Two-thirds of those with no history of mental illness or drug addiction reported some kind of welcome-home event just after prison release. Of those with mental illness and drug addiction, only one in six received a welcome-home party</p>

<p>Jerry left incarceration in a prison van and went to a shelter, where his release went uncelebrated. When I talked to him a week after getting out, he said that his greatest difficulty was “dealing with the mental stimulus.”</p>

<p>“It’s very overwhelming,” he said. “You have to understand the situation I was in where for the last 19 years nothing changed. The view, for the most part, the people, the routine — everything was the same. Suddenly, there’s sights, sounds, options, everything all at once. Bam. There’s no transition.”</p>

<p>We Are Witnesses </p>

<p>In the first week after release, about 40 percent of our respondents described feelings of anxiety or panic. They were often distressed by public transport and crowded places like stores and nightclubs. Many respondents stayed off trains and buses for the first few months to avoid being jostled by strangers.</p>

<p>Despair, isolation and all the ensuing limitations could be paralyzing, depleting energy for the dozens of tasks that accompany the first weeks after prison. Getting identification, applying for food stamps, buying clothes, seeing a doctor, going to parole, and countless other practicalities could feel overwhelming.</p>

<p>Prisons, for all their effects, create an important event — leaving — that begins a struggle for social belonging. Freedom after prison is not granted by release, but is attained gradually. Becoming free first requires adjusting to the everyday tasks and interactions of free society and leaving behind the habits of the institution.</p>

<p>After getting out of prison, Jerry spent hours in downtown Boston, watching office workers walk by from the towers around his homeless shelter. I once saw him sitting alone on a park bench while I was interviewing another respondent. He sat for an hour by himself around midday, looking out on the square. He told me of his people watching, “I fall in love with everybody, and no one falls in love with me.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the key lesson of the reentry study says something deep about the nature of incarceration. We usually think of incarceration as a deprivation of liberty, a loss of autonomy. But the men and women leaving prison in Boston were also disconnected from the intimate bonds of family, friendship, work and community. We saw in the stress of transition a strange kind of homesickness that endured even as the respondents returned from prison. Life, and all the relationships that comprise it, felt alien. Until it became more familiar, they were not yet home.</p>

<h2 id="californiavotersrejectprosecutorreformers">California Voters Reject Prosecutor 'Reformers'</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-06-06</p>

<p>District Attorney Summer Stephan in San Diego on Tuesday. Stephan appeared to hold off a challenge from a Soros-backed candidate in San Diego's primary.</p>

<p>California voters appeared to reject liberal challengers in three closely watched district attorney races on Tuesday, delivering a sharp defeat to a national network attempting to reshape the criminal justice system by electing left-leaning prosecutors.</p>

<p>A consortium of wealthy liberal donors and activists, headlined by New York billionaire George Soros, contributed millions of dollars to battle candidates backed by money from law enforcement groups. Four races dominated. In Sacramento, Alameda and San Diego counties, the challengers lost. In Contra Costa County, their candidate—Diana Becton, a former judge appointed as district attorney last year—was 500 votes shy of a majority and will likely face a runoff against career prosecutor Paul Graves in November, according to initial returns posted by county elections offices. It’s unclear how many ballots remain to be counted.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they suggest that the movement to elect reform prosecutors has hit a wall,” said Stanford Law Professor David Sklansky. “It’s still very difficult to run against an incumbent district attorney.”</p>

<p>Progressives have been mounting such campaigns since 2015 and will continue their efforts this year, when prosecutor elections are likely to get national attention in Massachusetts, Texas, North Carolina and Missouri.</p>

<p>District attorneys wield enormous influence within local criminal justice systems, deciding what charges to prioritize for prosecution and when to seek rehabilitation or lengthy incarceration. By supporting the election of like-minded district attorneys, the network of national and local activists and funders hope to secure many of the sentencing and bail policies they have struggled to realize through laws or ballot initiatives.</p>

<p>Contra Costa County District Attorney Diana Becton discussed the arrest of Golden State Killer suspect Joseph James DeAngelo during a news conference in April.</p>

<p>It appears more money and louder rhetoric are here to stay. The singer John Legend and the actress Roseanne Barr have weighed in. Several incumbents targeted by Soros accused him of trying to buy local justice systems.</p>

<p>The campaigns have alarmed many in law enforcement, who warn of a slippery slope if prosecutors pick and choose what laws to enforce. “They’re basically promising in advance to violate their oath of office,” said Michele Hanisee, president of the union that represents Los Angeles County prosecutors. “It is not the job of an elected district attorney to decide what laws to uphold. The district attorney’s job is to implement the law.”</p>

<p>In Sacramento, the liberal coalition supported Noah Phillips, a career prosecutor who challenged his boss, Anne Marie Schubert, a prominent conservative voice in statewide politics. Phillips focused on anger over police shootings, particularly the death of Stephon Clark, an unarmed black man shot in March as officers searched for a burglary suspect. The race took another twist in April, when Schubert announced the capture of a suspect in the infamous Golden State Killer case. Her campaign capitalized on the arrest, unrolling new ads that touted, “She protects us.” Schubert declared victory, though Phillips had not conceded as of Wednesday morning because many ballots had not yet been counted</p>

<p>In San Diego, incumbent Summer Stephan faced a challenge from Geneviéve Jones-Wright, a deputy public defender who promised, among other things, to create a police accountability unit. When Soros announced support for Jones-Wright, Stephan launched a website calling Jones-Wright “the anti-law enforcement candidate.” On Friday, families in two high-profile local homicides held opposing news conferences, one siding with Stephan, the other criticizing her. Stephan won.</p>

<p>Both sides are reading the tea leaves in the California results. The progressives believe the challenges, though unsuccessful, will force the winners to be more responsive to their communities. “These candidates force conversations that hadn’t been happening before, and they were so persuasive that some incumbents were forced to address those issues,” said Adam Foss, a former Massachusetts prosecutor who trains his peers around the country through the group Prosecutor Impact.</p>

<p>For some prosecutors, the races were proof that liberals are too quick to assume that voters will choose their vision. “The idea that there is a dichotomy between lock-em-up, tough-on-crime prosecutors and enlightened progressives is false. It’s more nuanced,” said Joshua Marquis, the DA of Clatsop County, Oregon, who is on the board of the National District Attorneys’ Association. “There might be voters who chose Bernie Sanders but then chose Anne Marie Schubert or Nancy O’Malley.”</p>

<p>Marquis also points out that voters also roundly rejected a Soros-backed candidate for district attorney in Washington County, Oregon, last month. (The candidate who won received money from Nike founder Phil Knight.)</p>

<p>Big-money intervention has fueled criticism that outsiders are interfering in local campaigns they know little about. Some candidates complained they have been targeted despite their support for liberal justice policies. “It’s a big-money, outside money approach where they didn’t even interview candidates,” said James Fisfis, a consultant to Paul Graves, who has pledged not to prosecute cases in which police conducted a search or made an arrest based solely on racial profiling a suspect. “The whole thing is just strange to us.”</p>

<p>These dynamics are sure to continue as more elections loom across the country. Organizers say the campaigns are just the start of a long-term strategy. Though it remains to be seen which races will get such attention, a few show signs of turning into big battles. Color of Change PAC, which has received funding from Soros, is supporting Faris Dixon, a district attorney candidate this fall in Pitt County, North Carolina. With an incumbent departing in Suffolk County, Massachusetts—encompassing Boston—the field there is wide open. In nearby Middlesex County, a defense lawyer is challenging an incumbent. Bob McCulloch, the longtime incumbent in St. Louis County, Missouri—who was criticized for failing to get an indictment of Darren Wilson for the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown—will face Wesley Bell, a Ferguson City Council member who wants to “end mass incarceration,” in August.</p>

<p>“It’s notable that reformers got 35 to 40 percent—that’s significant for a brand-new strategy that’s up against a deeply entrenched and resourced establishment,” said Anne Irwin, a former San Francisco public defender who started a nonprofit advocacy organization that helped a network of donors identify candidates to support. “We’ll continue to educate voters about the power of their district attorney, and we’ll get ready for 2020 and 2022.”</p>

<p>Full disclosure: The Marshall Project receives funding from the Soros-funded Open Society Foundations and other organizations that support efforts to reform California's criminal justice system. Under the terms of its funding, The Marshall Project has sole editorial control of its news reporting.</p>

<h2 id="thed580copay">The $580 Co-pay</h2>

<p>by: Beth Schwartzapfel</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-29</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/30/the-580-co-pay </p>

<p>For those in the outside world accustomed to paying $25 or more at every doctor’s visit, the idea of prisoners paying $2 to $8 to see a doctor seems nominal. Forty-two states plus the federal Bureau of Prisons charge a co-pay, according to the Prison Policy Initiative, a criminal justice think tank.</p>

<p>When you’re making pennies an hour, or nothing at all, a small co-pay can be the equivalent of hundreds of dollars.</p>

<p>Illinois lawmakers want to change that in their state. They voted last week to eliminate the $5 co-pay the state’s prisons have been charging for years. “When you’re denied your liberty, medical care is part of the deal. If you need it, you should get it,” said Jennifer Vollen-Katz, executive director of the John Howard Association, a state prison watchdog group that pushed the legislation. In letters and surveys, co-pays consistently emerged as one of prisoners’ biggest concerns, Vollen-Katz said, with more than half saying they avoid health care to avoid the co-pay.</p>

<p>Prisons charge co-pays for similar reasons as free-world health insurers: to cut down on unnecessary medical visits by requiring patients to share in the cost of their care. U.S. prisons spend between $3,000 and $10,000 per inmate per year on medical care—about 20 percent of total prison spending—according to a 2014 analysis by the Pew Charitable Trusts.</p>

<p>“We want a real-world environment for the prisoners because in the real world you and I would be required to have a copay,” Mark Myers, spokesman for the Oklahoma Department of Corrections, told the news site the Frontier. Prisoners in Oklahoma earn 5 cents per hour at the bottom of the wage scale, so the state’s $4 co-pay is roughly equivalent to $580 for a minimum wage worker on the outside, the Frontier reported.</p>

<p>Most states charge a fee for each visit, with a $3.47 national average, according to the Prison Policy Initiative's 2017 analysis. At $8 per visit, Nevada’s prison co-pay is the highest in the nation. “Charging a co-pay encourages the inmates to develop personal responsibility for their health care, it helps manage the volume of unnecessary doctor appointments in the clinics and assists with a small portion of the medical costs,” said Brooke Santina, spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Corrections.</p>

<p>Texas charges inmates $100 per year—which officials are looking to double in the face of rising health care costs. Co-pay programs generally have carve-outs for inmates who can’t afford to pay and exceptions for chronic and communicable conditions—though some inmates have reported these exceptions being ignored or applied unevenly.</p>

<p>Life Inside </p>

<p>Despite their toll on inmates’ individual finances, the fees don’t add up to much on prisons’ balance sheets. In Illinois, the $5 co-pay brings in about $400,000 per year—not enough to recoup the administrative costs of running the program, according to Department of Corrections spokeswoman Lindsey Hess. A 2012 brief by the Oregon Department of Corrections—which only charges a co-pay in limited circumstances like elective care and eyeglasses—estimated administering a broader co-pay program would cost the department $3 to $5 per visit.</p>

<p>A single inmate who is hospitalized because he put off a visit to the doctor until his condition worsened can be enough to wipe out any cost savings, says Dr. Marc Stern, a correctional health care consultant and former assistant secretary of health care at the Washington state Department of Corrections. Washington charges inmates a $4 co-pay, a practice that “is difficult to defend,” Stern wrote in a 2007 memo to the department.</p>

<p>With prisoners living in close quarters, any policy that deters people from going to the doctor also increases the risk of contagion. In 2003, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention identified inmate co-pays as one of the factors contributing to an outbreak of the super-bug MRSA among prisoners in Georgia, California and Texas. The National Commission on Correctional Health Care, which accredits prison and jail health care programs, cited this outbreak as one of the reasons it opposes fee-for-service or co-pay programs behind bars.</p>

<p>In Illinois, the Department of Corrections took a neutral position on the bill to eliminate co-pays, says Hess, the spokeswoman.</p>

<p>The bill next goes to Gov. Bruce Rauner for his signature. He did not respond to a Marshall Project inquiry about whether he plans to sign it.</p>

<p>Police records in Bentonville, Arkansas show that James Bates called 911 on Sunday morning just before Thanksgiving 2015, and reported chilling news: he’d just opened his back door and found one of his buddies floating face down in the hot tub, dead. When police showed up, Bates said he had no idea how it happened.</p>

<p>He also said they could search his home, according to police. And they found his house and yard were equipped with smart gadgets that might have served as digital eyes and ears. One was a smart utilities meter, which tracks far more details about water consumption than old-fashioned meters do. Another was an Amazon Echo on the kitchen counter—a smart speaker connected to the voice-controlled digital assistant service called Alexa—as in, “Hey Alexa, play me Drake/book a hotel/call an Uber.” As the police looked around, Bates probably had no inkling that he was entering a national debate: When do police have legal access to the trove of personal information that our smart homes collect?</p>

<p>Two developments coming soon could affect the answer. The Supreme Court will rule on a case concerning privacy and digital records, and new regulations in Europe will tighten access to people’s digital information there.</p>

<p>Back in Bentonville, police went after data from Bates’ smart home with zeal. A manager at the utilities department told them that Bates’ smart meter showed he’d used far more water between 1–3 a.m. than he’d ever used during the same period before. Police surmised that Bates had hosed the back patio to erase signs of a struggle. They charged him with murder.</p>

<p>Prosecutors also ordered Amazon to turn over the recordings that Bates’ digital assistant made before and after he said he found the body. Amazon records your vocal commands, and sometimes background talk, and stores the audio on distant servers. Amazon resisted, the prosecutors started fighting the company in court—and Bates gave up the recordings voluntarily. Prosecutors dropped the case late last year, saying they couldn’t prove he was guilty. Apparently, Alexa still awaits her court debut. But the case gave the nation a glimpse of what’s in store as our homes keep getting smarter: law enforcement will treat your appliances as potential witnesses.</p>

<p>It seems new smart gadgets are introduced every week. There are smart TVs, which suggest the programs they think you’ll like. Smart refrigerators are equipped with interior cameras and UPC scanners that keep track of the items you stock in your refrigerator, and then reorder them as they run out. One brand of smart mattress “tracks over 15 factors about your sleep and health, including deep sleep, heart rate and respiratory rate,” according to its website.</p>

<p>“From a law enforcement or intelligence perspective, these are very valuable tools that can let them monitor or listen to individuals,” says Dale Watson, the FBI’s former executive assistant director, now a consultant.</p>

<p>“Smart devices are also kind of frightening,” Watson says. “What are the legal ramifications? The technology is moving so fast that the laws and courts haven’t caught up with it.”</p>

<p>One reason there aren’t clear legal guidelines has to do with the way smart homes work, which, some analysts contend, means they’re not protected by the Fourth Amendment. “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,” the Amendment declares. Courts have ruled that means police can’t search your home, except in emergencies, without convincing a judge to sign a search warrant on the grounds that there’s “probable cause” they will find evidence of a crime.</p>

<p>But the Supreme Court and other courts have established a broad exception, called the “third party doctrine.” The government does not need a search warrant in most cases to get personal information that you’ve already shared voluntarily with somebody else, like a bank or internet provider or utility.</p>

<p>Well, smart devices in your home are constantly sharing your personal information with somebody else. This “internet of things” sends details about your food orders and sleep cycles and conversations with Alexa through your router and over the internet, usually to the manufacturer or a contractor. So some government officials argue that the third party doctrine applies and they can get that information just by asking for it. When “third party” companies balk, police in some states get the information by issuing a subpoena, no judge’s approval needed.</p>

<p>The Record </p>

<p>For instance, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company disclosed recently that government agencies subpoenaed data generated by smart meters at 480 homes and businesses last year. A company spokesperson would not disclose which agencies, but the company has given meter data before to the FBI and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, among others.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court hasn’t ruled yet on issues raised specifically by smart homes, but it is about to decide another case that could have a bearing on the issue. The question in Carpenter v. United States is, can the government get historical cell phone location data from your phone company without a warrant? If so, how far back into your history can it go? In resolving those questions, the justices might hint how strictly they want to protect other data generated by your smart meter and refrigerator.</p>

<p>And on May 25, the European Union will enact sweeping new rules that remind America how much its own laws on digital privacy are lagging. The policy has an uninspiring name—the General Data Protection Regulation—but it does something dramatic, at least on paper: it requires companies to clearly tell consumers what kind of data they want to collect, and gives consumers an easy way to say, “No!”</p>

<p>European officials have tended to protect privacy more fiercely than their U.S. counterparts. Consider the saga of My Friend Cayla, the talking doll.</p>

<p>Back in 2016, American advocacy groups, including Consumers Union and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), asked the Federal Trade Commission to ban the 18-inch doll on the grounds that it can spy on children and their parents. When children talk to Cayla through a tiny embedded mike, software converts their speech into text, then searches the internet for appropriate responses, and finally turns them back into Cayla’s own voice. Miraculous, perhaps, but critics pointed out that the company that makes Cayla’s voice recognition software, Nuance Communications, also helps law enforcement and intelligence agencies identify bad guys by searching “millions of audio files” in its data banks, according to the Nuance website. What if they mistakenly identified your child as a terrorist? “It’s beyond creepy,” says Sam Lester, EPIC’s main privacy attorney.</p>

<p>The FTC didn’t budge. But German officials banned the dolls last year for being an “illegal espionage apparatus.” A German government spokesman called on the public to destroy the dolls, or at least disable their digital wizardry.</p>

<p>So far, these creepy concerns seem mainly hypothetical. But the torrent of personal information generated by smart homes gets the ACLU’s Nathan Wessler contemplating troubling scenarios.</p>

<p>Suppose police suspect a man of organizing a political protest that turned violent, muses Wessler, who argued the Carpenter case for the ACLU before the Supreme Court. The suspect’s smart meter and thermostat confirm that a handful of people showed up at his home and stayed there the two nights before the demonstration; the suspect’s smart refrigerator ordered a bunch of soda and snack food on those days, which was all consumed; after someone asked Alexa to play some music in his living room, a voice in the background said, “Tomorrow, we’re going to really show them”; and that night, the suspect’s smart mattress recorded him sleeping fitfully and his heart beating faster than normal. The police arrest the man on conspiracy and other charges. He eventually proves he’s innocent – some old friends visited from out of town, and planned a day of sightseeing—but not before a legal nightmare turns his life upside down.</p>

<p>"There’s not a person among us who doesn’t have private aspects of their life that could create difficulty for them if they were exposed,” Wessler says. “And misinterpreted.”</p>

<p>Daniel Zwerdling, formerly a senior investigative correspondent with NPR, is an independent journalist. The Marshall Project’s daily email newsletter, Opening Statement, is available as a flash briefing on Alexa devices.</p>

<p>Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the agency that advocacy groups asked to ban the My Friend Cayla doll. It was the Federal Trade Commission.</p>

<h2 id="prosecutorelectionsnowafrontlineinthejusticewars">Prosecutor Elections Now a Front Line in the Justice Wars</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-05-22</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/23/prosecutor-elections-now-a-front-line-in-the-justice-wars </p>

<p>San Diego Deputy Public Defender Genevieve Jones-Wright announced last July that she was running for San Diego County District Attorney.</p>

<p>In most district attorney elections, the campaign playbook is clear: Win over the local cops and talk tough on crime.</p>

<p>But in California this year, the strategy is being turned on its head.</p>

<p>Wealthy donors are spending millions of dollars to back would-be prosecutors who want to reduce incarceration, crack down on police misconduct and revamp a bail system they contend unfairly imprisons poor people before trial.</p>

<p>The effort is part of a years-long campaign by liberal groups to reshape the nation’s criminal justice system. New York billionaire George Soros headlines a consortium of private funders, the ACLU and other social justice groups and Democratic activists targeting four of the 56 district attorney positions up for election on June 5. Five other California candidates are receiving lesser support.</p>

<p>The cash infusion turns underdog challengers into contenders for one of the most powerful positions in local justice systems, roiling conventional law-and-order politics.</p>

<p>For years, district attorney “races tended to focus on character issues rather than policies.... So it's really quite a change," said Stanford Law Professor David Sklansky, a former federal prosecutor.</p>

<p>In San Diego County, the groups back a deputy public defender who spent her legal career trying to keep the accused out of jail, not lock them up. In Sacramento and Alameda counties, they finance candidates taking on entrenched incumbents. And in Contra Costa County, they support a former judge appointed as district attorney last year who faces an election challenge from a career prosecutor.</p>

<p>The challengers have matched or surpassed the millions of dollars—largely from police, prosecutors and local business—flowing to incumbents unaccustomed to such organized liberal opposition.</p>

<p>But the coordination between big money and advocacy groups that don’t have to reveal their funding sources is largely out of public view.</p>

<p>The campaign has alarmed some law-and-order prosecutors, who warn that discretion over which laws to enforce and how has its limits.</p>

<p>“These people who want to create their own social policy are not worthy of the office,” said former Los Angeles County District Attorney Steve Cooley. “If they win in San Diego or Sacramento, L.A. is next.”</p>

<p>Many of the players funding liberal candidates joined forces in California four years ago to pass Proposition 47, which turned drug use and most theft convictions from felonies to misdemeanors. In funding local D.A. campaigns, activists hope to secure many of the sentencing and bail policies they have struggled to realize through laws or ballot initiatives.</p>

<p>The effect of Proposition 47 and other recent sentencing reductions is highly contested. Opponents say the changes caused a rise in crime, but proponents dispute the claim.</p>

<p>Where law-and-order campaigns appeal to fear, the new strategy targets anger.</p>

<p>One issue that has caught fire is police shootings.</p>

<p>“It’s really coming from this Black Lives Matter moment of police accountability,” said Margaret Dooley-Sammuli, criminal justice and drug policy director for the ACLU of California.</p>

<p>Sacramento County Deputy District Attorney Noah Phillips is running for district attorney with the backing of criminal justice reform groups.</p>

<p>In Sacramento, where liberal activists are embedded directly in the insurgent campaign of Noah Phillips, the deputy prosecutor is attacking his boss’ record of having never charged a police officer who shot a civilian.</p>

<p>Phillips credits Soros’ team for scripting and paying for his television ad. Fundraising help came from a senior advisor to Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, now at the helm of Real Justice, a political action committee with a mission to “fix our broken justice system” that is underwritten by Cari Tuna, the wife of Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. Other national advocates and philanthropists provide writing services and media coaching.</p>

<p>At the same time, Black Lives Matter activists were holding near-daily protests on the doorstep of Phillips’ opponent, career prosecutor Anne Marie Schubert. They demand Schubert press charges against officers who earlier this year, searching for a burglary suspect, shot and killed an unarmed black man named Stephon Clark. To keep demonstrators at a distance, Schubert has surrounded her office with a 10-foot fence.</p>

<p>Phillips has directly appealed to those in the African American community enraged by Clark's death by dispensing leaflets at a memorial rally and through a Soros-produced TV ad that dwells on the face of a black boy beneath a hooded sweatshirt.</p>

<p>Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert supports a proposed ballot measure that would toughen sentencing laws.</p>

<p>Schubert's ads tout her role in the recent arrest of the alleged Golden State Killer, who terrorized Sacramento’s white suburbs four decades ago.</p>

<p>Each candidate is backed by around $1.1 million. Schubert, a leader in support of a proposed ballot measure that would toughen sentencing laws, draws most of her funding from line-level prosecutors, the business community and police unions. Half of Phillips’ money is from Soros.</p>

<p>In San Diego, the county's limit of $800 for individual campaign contributions forces the campaigners to work independently of their favored candidate, Geneviéve Jones-Wright.</p>

<p>Soros has supplied more than $1.5 million to a political action committee to promote the deputy public defender waging a longshot bid for D.A. National liberal organizations have joined the fight for Jones-Wright, as have wealthy Silicon Valley donors.</p>

<p>Decrying policies that are “criminalizing poverty,” Jones-Wright promises to create a police misconduct unit, stop seeking cash bail in low-level cases and end prosecuting “quality of life” offenses, such as sleeping on the sidewalk or loitering, which she says unfairly target the homeless.</p>

<p>The incumbent, career prosecutor Summer Stephan, favors more moderate changes and calls Jones-Wright an “anti-prosecutor.” Stephan touts her work on sex crimes and human trafficking prosecutions. Much of the $1.1 million backing her comes from police unions and prosecutors.</p>

<p>The grenades her campaign launches are aimed at Soros as much as at her opponent. When Soros’ first TV ads hit San Diego airwaves, Stephan’s campaign released ThreatToSanDiego.com, a website declaring public safety under attack. It carries a picture of Soros superimposed over masked, black-clad street demonstrators. In Sacramento this week, Schubert launched an almost identical website.</p>

<p>San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan touts her work on sex crimes and human trafficking prosecutions.</p>

<p>Jones-Wright rejects descriptions of her funding as an outside threat by groups trying to buy a national agenda, one county at a time. Soros’ money, she said, gives a voice to poor and minority communities often ignored in prosecutor races.</p>

<p>"I love it!" she told lawyers at a recent fundraiser. "If he didn't take an interest in this campaign, it would be an even more uneven playing field."</p>

<p>Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley says she’s bewildered that she’s a Soros target. The registered Democrat showcases endorsements not only from police leaders but also U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., organized labor and Democratic clubs.</p>

<p>Her opponent, civil rights lawyer Pamela Price, criticizes O’Malley’s ties with law enforcement, including political donations from police unions. Mailers sent by Soros’ PAC condemn “racist” stop and frisk policies and promise that Price would end them.</p>

<p>Just to the north, liberal funders throw their support behind Diana Becton, a long-time judge recently appointed district attorney of Contra Costa County when her predecessor resigned amid a political corruption scandal. A veteran prosecutor hoping to unseat Becton seized on her financial support from “billionaires who apparently think Contra Costa’s public safety is for sale.”</p>

<p>Five more challengers in Marin, Riverside, San Bernardino, Stanislaus and Yolo counties are getting smaller donations from some liberal donors.</p>

<p>At stake is ensuring that prosecutors aren’t out of touch with the communities they represent, said Shaun King, co-founder of the Real Justice PAC.</p>

<p>“The district attorneys in our country don’t represent the true diversity, the broad cross-section of views of our country,” King said. “Less than 1 percent are women of color, which is a crazy number.… People who are running for the office of district attorney are prosecuting people they don’t know. They’ve never been to a picnic with them, never sat in a pew with them.”</p>

<p>Soros, whose spending as of this week in California topped $2.7 million, is the most visible part of the national movement to sway county prosecutor races. Since 2014, he has spent more than $16 million in 17 county races in other states. His favored candidates won in 13.</p>

<p>One of them, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, fired 31 prosecutors during his first week on the job in January. Calling for an end to “mass incarceration,” Krasner also ordered the rest of his office to stop prosecuting marijuana possession, steer more defendants toward diversion programs and announce at sentencing hearings how much a prison term would cost taxpayers.</p>

<p>After her 2016 victory in Houston, Kim Ogg announced she would no longer prosecute the possession of small amounts of marijuana. In Chicago, the Soros-backed candidate stopped filing felony theft charges for property worth less than $1,000.</p>

<p>The changes have outraged police and prosecutor associations. The head of the union for Los Angeles County prosecutors recently issued a statewide call for donations to counter Soros' money in San Diego.</p>

<p>Michele Hanisee, the group’s president, said Soros and the ACLU call on prosecutors to “pick and choose” which laws they enforce.</p>

<p>“It is a very, very slippery slope when you are asking the elected official to ignore laws they have sworn to uphold,” Hanisee said.</p>

<p>Behind the publicly reported political spending is millions more in grants to non-profit advocacy groups. The organizations mobilize members to knock on doors, test political messages and promote liberal candidates and policies.</p>

<p>Many of those activities don’t show up in campaign finance reports. Federal tax laws allow nonprofit advocacy groups to hide the source of their money, and to disclose summaries of their spending years after the fact. It will be 2020 before Californians will be able to see the full scale of the involvement in June’s elections.</p>

<p>But tax forms, grant documents and interviews by The Los Angeles Times and The Marshall Project show that a coalition of wealthy donors, private foundations and advocacy groups by last year had sunk $11 million into grants focused on district attorney elections across the nation. At the top is the Open Philanthropy Project, a foundation started by Moskovitz and Tuna, that from 2014 to 2017 directed $6.6 million toward “prosecutorial reform” or similar terms.</p>

<p>Major grant recipients include the ACLU. The group’s projects include national polling last year measuring voter interest in the county races, and scorecards helping promote the liberal platforms of candidates in Texas and California. Soros gave $50 million to the ACLU in 2014 for work on criminal justice issues, though it’s unclear how much if any was earmarked for the prosecutor campaign.</p>

<p>A constellation of other San Francisco Bay area philanthropists and Silicon Valley elite are writing checks alongside Tuna’s foundation, including Kaitlyn Krieger, wife of Instagram co-founder Michael Krieger, and Liz Simons, the daughter of a hedge fund billionaire. (Simons sits on The Marshall Project’s board of directors.)</p>

<p>The collaboration included a panel on prosecutor races last fall at the closed-door retreat of Democracy Alliance, a coalition of groups and leaders who pool their resources behind liberal causes. In July, a similar group, The Tides Foundation, hosted campaign directors for Soros and the ACLU and racial-justice activists from Color of Change to talk about steering nonprofit money toward the cause.</p>

<p>In electing liberal prosecutors, participants said, the groups also seek to build voter bases for larger elections.</p>

<p>The 2016 election in Illinois of Kim Foxx as Cook County state’s attorney illustrated the power of combining national money and local field teams.</p>

<p>The first large checks paid for polling that showed Foxx dead last just two months before the March primary, according to a post-election report by one of the groups that backed her, National People’s Action Campaign.</p>

<p>Foxx’s supporters walked black wards and suburbs handing out flyers. Donations began to roll in. Soros joined the fight. So did Color of Change, Move On and Democracy for America — national organizations also engaged in the California races.</p>

<p>The groups paid for media buys and tapped membership lists for volunteers. Local organizations stepped up field operations and embedded directly in Foxx’s campaign, accomplishing half the get-out-the-vote effort, for free.</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter demonstrators bird-dogged Foxx’s main opponent, a two-term incumbent, the report said, “keeping negative attention on” her delay in bringing murder charges against a Chicago police officer who shot a black teen walking away from officers. Dash cam video of the shooting sparked national outrage and local protests.</p>

<p>Foxx won in a landslide, becoming Cook County’s first black state’s attorney.</p>

<p>The report called the collaboration “a template for the national progressive movement.”</p>

<p>But other candidates have fallen short. Targeted incumbents in Arizona and Colorado survived challenges despite Soros heavily funding their opponents.</p>

<p>“We knew that George Soros couldn’t find Jefferson County on a map,” said Peter Weir, who heads the district attorney’s office in the suburbs west of Denver. “Justice was not for sale in Jefferson County.”</p>

<p>Even if they do win, some liberal prosecutors meet resistance to fulfilling their campaign promises.</p>

<p>In Florida, the attorney general stepped in to pursue the death penalty against a man charged with killing a police officer when Orlando’s new state attorney refused. And in Texas, 15 of Harris County’s 16 judges refuse to accept the district attorney’s lower bail recommendations.</p>

<p>“We went after the D.A., which is a good start, but we have to change the entire [justice] administration,” said Tarsha Jackson, criminal justice director of the Texas Organizing Project.</p>

<p>The project’s next target? Elect new judges.</p>

<p>The Marshall Project is supported by a George Soros foundation and other organizations that support efforts to reform the state's criminal justice system. Under terms of its funding, The Marshall Project has sole editorial control of its news reporting.</p>

<p>Correction: An earlier version of this story misspelled the name of philanthropist Kaitlyn Krieger. Also, among other contested races, it erroneously included Fresno County. The Fresno County district attorney is running unopposed.</p>

<h2 id="sendingevenmoreimmigrantstoprison">Sending Even More Immigrants to Prison</h2>

<p>by: Yolanda Martinez</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-19</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/20/sending-even-more-immigrants-to-prison </p>

<p>When Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced earlier this month he would send 35 more federal prosecutors to districts along the U.S.-Mexico border to focus on prosecuting immigration offenses, it was only the latest salvo in the Trump administration’s war on illegal immigration. The announcement came on the heels of a Justice Department memo last month to prosecutors in border districts, asking them to prosecute more people for immigration offenses.</p>

<p>If the suggestion is that the government before Donald Trump was soft on illegal immigration, the numbers tell a different story.</p>

<p>A Marshall Project analysis of 17 years of federal prison sentences shows that violations of immigration law already constitute the largest category of offenses in the border districts—even more than drug trafficking. Nationally, of the nearly 60,500 people sentenced to federal prison in the last fiscal year, more than 30 percent were convicted of immigration offenses, which can include “illegal re-entry” or people-smuggling. Along the border, immigration took the lead from drug trafficking early in the Obama administration, in some years accounting for more than half of the border districts’ federal prison sentences.</p>

<p>Of the 94 federal court districts, the Southern and Western Districts of Texas send the most people to prison for these offenses—more than 8,000 last year where the length of length of the prison term was reported. Arizona and California also saw recent rises. In New Mexico the raw numbers are smaller, but immigration accounts for 76 percent of the new prison sentences that were handed down in the 2016–2017 federal fiscal year.</p>

<p>Federal courts have been sending fewer people to prison in recent years, and immigration sentences have fallen from their peak in 2011, but they still grew last year to almost 18,500 nationwide.</p>

<p>The data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission only include the first nine months of the Trump Administration, but the early indications are that imprisonment for violating immigration laws is again on the rise.</p>

<p>Most cases of migrants accused of entering the country illegally are handled in civil immigration courts, not criminal courts, but those who are caught returning after being removed can face a federal charge of “illegal re-entry” and a prison sentence of up to 20 years.</p>

<p>Sessions’ announcement and recent memo, which directed prosecutors to adopt “a zero-tolerance policy for all offenses referred for prosecution” in immigration cases, is of a piece with the Trump administration’s many policy changes, from restricting migration based on country of origin, to investing more in the Border Patrol and increasing deportations.</p>

<p>Although people often are convicted of multiple offenses, data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission counts only the primary, or most serious, charge for each person sentenced in federal court, except for petty offenses. In 2009, immigration became the most common major crime category for prison sentences, knocking drug trafficking to a close second-place, where it has remained ever since. By 2011, immigration offenses ballooned to 36 percent of all federal prison sentences. (Overall, all drug offenses, including possession, make up the most federal prosecutions, nearly one-third, according to a 2016 report from the Pew Research Center).</p>

<p>But Sessions’ instructions to prosecutors to focus more attention on immigration may conflict with an earlier directive he sent telling Justice Department lawyers across the country to go after drug cases with more gusto.</p>

<p>“All these things link together rhetorically [for Sessions],” says Mona Lynch, professor of criminology at University of California, Irvine, who wrote “Hard Bargains,” a book about the variability in drug sentencing in three federal districts. It’s part of “a triad of concerns he constructed around a renewed war on street crimes, gangs, and immigration.”</p>

<p>Outside the border districts, drug trafficking is still the top offense for prison sentences in much of the country, illustrating the diverging ways Justice Department priorities play out in different regions. Any two federal court districts may focus on different crimes, even in neighboring districts in the same state, such as in California or Texas. Since 2001, about a third of all districts have seen a decrease in the proportion of their prison sentences that are for immigration offenses. Sixty districts have seen an increase, with a lot of variation from year-to-year.</p>

<p>In the Northern District of Iowa, prison sentences in immigration cases have fluctuated wildly. They went from half of all sentences in 2008 to only 9 percent the following year. Last year, immigration cases accounted for 20 percent of the prison sentences in the district. Over that same stretch of time time, the unauthorized immigrant population in Iowa remained steady, according to Pew Research Center estimates.</p>

<p>This came as apprehensions along the border went down to roughly 304,000 last year, the lowest they've been in more than 45 years, suggesting the Department of Justice does not exercise complete control over its U.S. attorneys, says Lynch.</p>

<p>“It’s localized legal culture,” says Lynch, “Federal courts are embedded within communities where there are norms around punishment and crime.” Local offices set their own priorities, argues Lynch. Take the Southern District of New York, which encompasses New York City. As the hub of the finance industry, its prosecutors tend to focus on complex financial crimes, and the office’s culture reflects that.</p>

<p>But a focus on drugs, immigration and gangs will leave fewer resources for pursuing other crimes. “White-collar and child porn and financial crime is likely to take a back seat if Sessions has his way in directing priorities,” says Lynch.</p>

<p>Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified the districts that sends the most people to prison for immigration offenses. They are the Southern and Western Districts of Texas. Also, the story earlier misstated the year when prison sentences for immigration were at their highest point. It was 2011.</p>

<h2 id="coreywilliamsabouttowalkfreeinlouisiana">Corey Williams About to Walk Free in Louisiana</h2>

<p>by: Andrew Cohen</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-20</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/21/corey-williams-about-to-walk-free-in-louisiana </p>

<p>Corey Williams was ordered released from a Louisiana prison Monday after serving more than 20 years for a murder many believe he did not commit. His sudden freedom—he is expected to be released early Tuesday—is a surprising twist in a legal drama that began with an ill-fated pizza delivery at a house in Shreveport in January 1998 and ended with the intellectually disabled man’s case pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Williams’ lawyers reached a deal with Caddo Parish attorneys in the past week or so—before the justices in Washington announced whether they would accept his case for review. After years of professing his innocence he agreed to plead guilty to manslaughter and obstruction of justice charges, which allowed prosecutors a face-saving way to credit him with time served and then endorse his immediate release.</p>

<p>Corey Williams with Amir Ali and Blythe Taplin, two of his lawyers, leaving Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola, La., on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The deal was approved Monday by Caddo Parish District Judge Katherine Dorroh, who then vacated Williams’ first-degree murder conviction. Her involvement, too, is ironic. She had ruled against Williams once before in the case and perhaps is best known as the trial judge who denied compensation for Glenn Ford, another man who spent decades in a Louisiana prison for a wrongful conviction before dying shortly after his release.</p>

<p>I’ve been following Williams’s cause since 2015. Last month, The Marshall Project chronicled anew the dubious case against him in our Case in Point series. It’s a case that got worse over time. Williams, 16 years old when arrested, was convicted of murdering a pizza delivery man and then sentenced to death even though all of the physical evidence in the case pointed to different and more compelling suspects. Police interrogated the teenager through a long night, and gained a “confession” from him, even though they knew about his profound intellectual disability.</p>

<p>The Next To Die </p>

<p>The prosecutor in his case was Hugo Holland, known for his zeal in capital cases involving black defendants. One of the reasons state attorneys endorsed a plea deal now might be because Williams’ lawyers recently discovered (in addition to all of the other flaws in the case) that trial prosecutors had faked “summaries” of witness statements to incriminate Williams and draw attention away from other suspects.</p>

<p>A Supreme Court decision focusing on those summaries and the way prosecutors manipulated them might have more than embarrassing for Caddo Parish prosecutors. It also might have jeopardized other cases where similar summaries were used. State attorneys never responded to the petition Williams’ lawyers filed for a review of the case by the Supreme Court and now the justices will have no reason to hear the case or decide its merits.</p>

<p>But the deal is harsh for Williams, too. By pleading guilty, by not waiting for the Supreme Court perhaps to rescue him, he forgoes the chance to seek compensation from the state and will have a conviction on his record as he begins—at the relatively young age of 36—to chart a post-prison life for himself. His lawyers may have felt that getting Williams quickly out of prison, where he reportedly has been bullied because of his disabilities, was more important than ensuring he might one day seek compensation from a state unlikely to grant it.</p>

<h2 id="isthefirststepactrealreform">Is The “First Step Act” Real Reform?</h2>

<p>by: Justin George</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-22</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/22/is-the-first-step-act-real-reform </p>

<p>A classroom at the Thomson Correctional Center, a federal prison, in Thomson, Ill. M. Spencer Green/Associated Press</p>

<p>Congress and criminal justice, a scorecard </p>

<p>The First Step Act, which passed the House of Representatives Tuesday, has been a hot-button topic for Congress. It addresses the dire need for rehabilitative services in the federal prison system, proves there is strong bipartisan support for at least modest criminal justice reform and underscores a strategic debate that has split the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>What is the First Step Act? The bill, sponsored by Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, and Doug Collins, a Georgia Republican, seeks to add educational and vocational training and mental health treatment in federal prison. It earmarks $50 million a year over five years to expand these in-prison opportunities. It also expands the number of days in a halfway house or home confinement that inmates can earn for good behavior and self-improvement. It would expand the use of risk assessment tools—algorithms that try to predict future behavior. It bans the shackling of pregnant women; calls for placing prisoners in facilities that are within 500 driving miles of their families; and helps them get identification cards upon release.</p>

<p>Why is there a debate? Opponents, mostly on the left, say any criminal justice reform bill should also reduce mandatory minimum sentences or give judges more discretion to make the punishment fit the crime. A bipartisan Senate bill, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, is also making its way through Congress. It includes “back end” reform—services for prisoners—and “front end” reform—reducing sentence time. Its supporters believe that the House bill is stealing support and momentum from the more comprehensive bill.</p>

<p>What’s the debate about? Proponents of the House bill say the comprehensive Senate bill being touted failed in 2016 when it had stronger bipartisan support and fewer obstacles during the Obama administration. Jeffries said an imperfect bill was a start. “You can’t simply wave one legislative magic wand and make it (mass incarceration) all go away,” Jeffries said last week during a House Judiciary Committee hearing. “It’s going to require a sustained effort, sustained intensity, sustained commitment and a meaningful first step.” Added Collins in the same hearing: “We can argue and talk about how I want to make it perfect. I wish that we passed perfect legislation up here all the time, but I don’t think there has ever been one, and holding a no vote on this bill is wrong. In fact, why would you vote no on a bill that would unshackle women who are having babies in prison? Why would you vote no on early release for elderly prisoners?”</p>

<p>Opponents say many of the mandates in the First Step Act can be accomplished without legislation. The Bureau of Prisons, for instance, has long been criticized for not releasing more elderly or infirmed prisoners under a process known as “compassionate release.” The bureau could also ensure that prisoners are placed closer to their families. They worry the bill, by relying on algorithms that may have a racial bias, could widen racial disparities in prison. But most of all, critics fear Congress will pass the more limited bill, congratulate itself and not return to the subject for years. The bill divides a strong coalition for comprehensive reform.</p>

<p>Life Inside </p>

<p>What happens next?</p>

<p>In the Senate, things get really interesting. Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, a Republican, has become a stubborn and vocal defender of sentencing reform. Speaking to an audience of faith-based advocates Tuesday, Grassley said he had come to realize that mandatory minimums come at a huge cost. Grassley, the chief sponsor of the sentencing reform bill, said the House bill was unacceptable.</p>

<p>“For that deal to pass the Senate, it must include sentencing reform,” he said. “This is necessary for practical as well as political reasons. First of all, it’s the right thing to do. Judges should have discretion to make sure that the punishment fits the crime and that criminal defendants are incentivized to cooperate with police investigations. Adjusting mandatory minimums for lower-level, nonviolent criminal offenders also saves a significant amount of money which can be used to target the worst offenders such as drug kingpins and violent criminals. Second, states that have seen the biggest drops in crime from criminal justice reform didn’t just do prison reform. They did sentencing reform too.”</p>

<p>Who’s lining up behind the First Step Act? More than 100 former federal prosecutors are endorsing the bill. Conservative groups such as the American Conservative Union Foundation believe the bill is a no-brainer. “So disappointed to see a handful of Democrats oppose the First Step Act because Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren don’t want to give Republicans a win,” David Safavian, deputy director of the group’s center for criminal justice reform, tweeted before the House vote. “Putting politics over the lives of those incarcerated—and their families—is just a horrible thing to do.” Prison Fellowship, a faith-based advocacy group popular with evangelicals, also supports the bill. As does Families Against Mandatory Minimums. FAMM President Kevin Ring said he understands those holding out for sentencing reform, but he said it’s been years since any meaningful bills have passed to help prisoners. He said he believes Jeffries and Collins will not stop pushing for sentencing reform if the First Step Act passes.</p>

<p>Who’s opposing it? Liberal Democrats such as Sens. Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Richard Durbin and Reps. John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee are leading the charge against the bill. More than 100 civil rights organizations are also opposing it, including the ACLU. “The FIRST STEP Act supporters say ‘something is better than nothing,’” tweeted Jesselyn B. McCurdy, deputy director for the ACLU’s Washington Legislative Office. “If criminal justice reform no longer addresses the very real problems in the federal system ... we are in trouble.” Former Attorney General Eric Holder said reformers should keep their eyes on the bigger prize. “Momentum for sentencing reform is being derailed by an effort that is misguided, ideological and outdated,” he tweeted. “The narrow ‘prison reform’ bill won’t deliver the transformative change we need. The only way to achieve that is by passing bipartisan, comprehensive sentencing reform.”</p>

<p>What does the White House support? President Donald Trump said if the prison reform bill reaches his desk, he will sign it. It’s less clear how he would react if Congress sent him a more ambitious bill, including sentencing changes. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has made it clear he does not support reducing sentences, and he worked hard to kill the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act in 2016 when he was a senator. Jared Kushner, the president’s advisor and son-in-law, has been a quiet proponent of giving judges more discretion when sentencing, and in private meetings he has voiced support for a comprehensive bill. However, it seems as if a prison reform-only bill gives Trump what he wants: To look tough to his base by not budging on sentences while also showing evangelicals he believes in “second chances.”</p>

<h2 id="marylandleadsasprisonpopulationscontinuetodecline">Maryland Leads as Prison Populations Continue to Decline</h2>

<p>by: Nicole Lewis</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-17</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/18/maryland-leads-as-prison-populations-continue-to-decline </p>

<p>In 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million people for the first time since 2004, according to a new report by the nonprofit Vera Institute of Justice. A decline in several states with large prison populations, including Maryland, Louisiana and Illinois, is responsible, along with a drop in federal prisoners.</p>

<p>Maryland saw the largest drop, with 1,916 people exiting state custody, representing a 9.6 percent decrease, according to the report. Louisiana and Illinois, each with larger populations, lost 1,943, or 5.4 percent, and 2,230, or 5.1 percent, respectively. Although the prison population in each state has been declining for several years, between 2016 and 2017, Maryland and Louisiana experienced the largest single year decreases in their prison populations in a decade.</p>

<p>Researchers credit sentencing and other criminal justice reforms that have passed in each of the states in recent years for the decline. Yet, despite the declines in Louisiana and Maryland, some lawmakers are pushing to scale back some of the law changes, citing rising violent crime rates.</p>

<p>States with largest percent decrease in prison population from 2016-2017</p>

<p>Maryland</p>

<p>-9.6% since 2016 -22.9% since 2007 </p>

<p>Connecticut</p>

<p>-7.5% since 2016 -33.9% since 2007 </p>

<p>Rhode Island</p>

<p>-7.5% since 2016 -28.5% since 2007 </p>

<p>Louisiana</p>

<p>-5.4% since 2016 -10.1% since 2007 </p>

<p>Illinois</p>

<p>-5.1% since 2016 -8.4% since 2007 </p>

<p>In 2016, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, signed the Justice Reinvestment Act into law, calling it “the largest and most comprehensive criminal justice reform to pass in Maryland in a generation." The bill reduced sentences for some low-level drug crimes, eliminated mandatory minimum sentences and improved parole and probation policies.</p>

<p>Commentary </p>

<p>The new legislation was the result of several years of research and advocacy led by Pew Charitable Trust and the Bureau of Justice Assistance. In 2006, BJA and Pew launched the Justice Reinvestment Initiative to help states reduce their swelling prison populations. Since 2007, 34 states have adopted new legislation developed through the initiatives.</p>

<p>Louisiana also signed on. In 2017, Louisiana Gov. John Bell Edwards, a Democrat, signed into law a series of bills that some have been hailed as the most comprehensive reforms in the state’s history. For years Louisiana has had the highest incarceration rate in the country. With the new legislation, which reduces penalties for repeat offenders, offers more alternatives to incarceration, and reduces maximum penalties for drug crimes, the state is poised to shed its long held title. Some of the effects of the legislation were felt almost immediately when nearly 2,000 inmates were released from prison in November due to a change in the way the state calculated prisoner’s good time.</p>

<p>In 2015, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner signed an executive order creating a commission on criminal justice and sentencing reform. The commission was tasked with understanding the main drivers of incarceration in the state and proposing reforms to reduce the population by 25 percent by 2025. At the start of 2017, Rauner signed several measures to achieve his goal, including eliminating mandatory minimums for some crimes.</p>

<p>The report’s authors hope the timely snapshot of the country’s prison population—gathered from state corrections websites and interviews—can help continue to move the needle on criminal justice reforms. The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics releases official data on state and federal prisoners every year, which includes detailed demographic information, but the 2017 data won’t be available until the end of 2018.</p>

<p>“There is a lot of talk about reform in states where the prison population is still growing,” said Jacob Kang-Brown, one of the report's authors. “For these states it is important to know that many places that are seeing success aren’t driving up the crime rates.”</p>

<p>In several states, the prison population increased between 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p>States with largest percent increase in prison population from 2016-2017</p>

<p>Tennessee</p>

<p>+6.6% since 2016 +14.4% since 2007 </p>

<p>Utah</p>

<p>+4.9% since 2016 -0.3% since 2007 </p>

<p>Kentucky</p>

<p>+3.7% since 2016 +6.3% since 2007 </p>

<p>South Dakota</p>

<p>+3.6% since 2016 +19.9% since 2007 </p>

<p>Wyoming</p>

<p>+3.2% since 2016 +17.6% since 2007 </p>

<p>While 30 states reduced their numbers, in 20 states the prison population increased between 2016 and 2017. Tennessee topped the list with a 6.6 percent increase, or more than 1,000 prisoners. Kentucky rose by 3.7 percent, or slightly more than 800 prisoners.</p>

<p>Data show that the majority of prisoners in Maryland and Louisiana are incarcerated for non-violent crimes. But a recent spike in the violent crime rate in each state has sparked an interest in revisiting some of the landmark legislation. In 2017, Maryland had 343 homicides, a record-setting number. And in April 2018, lawmakers passed a sweeping crime bill to address the violence.</p>

<p>Critics of the bill argue it threatens to undermine some of the progress made by the previous legislation in reducing mass incarceration. Moreover, they argue, the legislation was hastily put together and not data-informed.</p>

<p>“There is a feeling that something has to be done,” said Keith Wallington, state based strategist at Justice Policy Institute. “No one can ignore the fact that there is an increase in violent crime, but they never could identify what to do.”</p>

<p>In Louisiana, lawmakers are debating a set of bills that could roll back some of the 2017 legislation. Some prosecutors argue that newly released inmates have left prison only to commit new crimes, and that reduced sentences weaken prosecutors ability to encourage drug users to go to treatment or comply with the terms of their probation.</p>

<p>Pete Adams, executive director of Louisiana’s District Attorney Association, doesn’t see the new bills as a rolling back of last year’s legislation. Instead, he says, the focus should be on spending the money saved on locking people up on programs that help inmates participate productively once released.</p>

<p>“This will not have a long term reduction in incarceration rates if we don’t spend the resources required to provide rehabilitation, education, and mental health treatment to help turn people around,” Adams said. “If we let people out without any support, we are gonna see them again, and when they come back they come in for a longer period of time.”</p>

<h2 id="whenyourdadgetslockedupandthendeported">When Your Dad Gets Locked Up—And Then Deported</h2>

<p>by: Sally Deng</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-09</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/10/when-your-dad-gets-locked-up-and-then-deported </p>

<p>“It started to sink in that I wouldn’t really get a childhood.” </p>

<p>I crossed the border from Mexico with my parents when I was 6 years old. I remember walking for a day and a half and wading through a river. I remember sitting on my dad’s shoulders, feeling his skin peeling and blistering.</p>

<p>In Mexico, we had worked on a farm, growing and selling tomatoes and potatoes and carrots. My dad taught me to work hard. His motto was: Work to live another day. When we got to Houston, I enrolled in school while he worked in construction, and my mom stayed home with my younger siblings. Things were good for a while.</p>

<p>But less than a year after we arrived, my mom got a call, and I heard my dad had been arrested for driving under the influence. He was incarcerated for two years. Suddenly, it was like being on a tour without a guide. He could speak English, but none of us could, and my mom couldn’t drive.</p>

<p>We moved to Austin, where we had more family, and my mom got work with my aunt, cleaning houses. It was so hard without my dad, but I learned English and by third grade I’d become the man of the house, helping my mom get around and watching my younger siblings while she worked.</p>

<p>When my dad was released, he started working again. I stopped having to watch my siblings all the time, because my mom was able to stop working herself. I finally got to be the kid in the family, to play that role. I joined a soccer league at school. I thought this new feeling would last forever.</p>

<p>But it didn’t last long.</p>

<p>Dad was still using alcohol and drugs, and he would come home drunk and fight with my mom. He demanded that she stop working, and stay home while he made the money. That meant that when he was arrested a second time—a DUI, again—our life flipped upside down, again.</p>

<p>I was about to enter middle school, and realized I’d let myself get my hopes up. This is when it started to sink in, that this would be my life, that I wouldn’t really get a childhood because he would always be gone, and I would need to work to help my siblings and my mom with money. She missed my elementary school graduation, because she had to work. She never had time to show me love, to say “I love you, I’m proud of you.”</p>

<p>I was angry, and the bad things that happened to me started to feel like the result of what my dad had done. For example, my mom made extra money cooking menudo and serving it to construction workers, and one morning I was helping her carry a 50-pound pot of soup from the fire outside into the house. My shoes were wet, and I slipped on the tile floor. The soup burned my arms and legs, and I needed skin grafts. I was in the hospital for two weeks. I thought, This wouldn’t have happened if my mom didn’t need to work, and she wouldn’t need to work if my dad had not gone to prison.</p>

<p>When I visited my dad, I told him, from behind the glass at the detention facility, “This happened because of you. I’m ashamed to take off my shirt in public because of you. I’m ashamed when I look in the mirror because of you.” He was speechless. Then he cried and said, “I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>In middle school, I started to notice that other kids in my position, with fathers in prison and mothers always working, were finding family elsewhere—in gangs. I felt like I had a lot in common with those kids. They sold drugs, and it seemed like such an easy way to help your family with money. But I was small for my age, so I was afraid, watching my friends get “jumped” as part of gang initiations.</p>

<p>I think the principal at my school could tell I was slipping. She saw this nice, humble kid suddenly becoming careless, dressing differently. In seventh grade, she told me she’d be assigning me a mentor; there was an organization, called the Seedling Foundation, that provided adult mentors for kids with parents in prison. At first, I said, “I don’t have time for this,” but she explained he would come meet me at lunch. His name was Tucker. He started showing up once a week. He’d come through the lunch line with me and then we’d go sit on the school’s porch, away from the noise.</p>

<p>ViewFinder </p>

<p>He asked me about school, about my hobbies. I was shy at first, but I told him I liked soccer. He asked me about my favorite teams, whether I’d watched a particular game over the weekend, whether I was going to try out for the school team. He pushed me to make time for soccer, because he knew it was one thing I could do to feel like myself, to let go of all the pressures. Tucker and I kicked a ball around during lunch one day and he said, “This is who you are.”</p>

<p>Little by little, I opened up. I had never talked to a grown man in this way about myself.</p>

<p>“You know what?” I said one day. “It’s pretty rough. My friends are having fun on the weekends, and I can’t go because I have to watch my siblings. I want to give up on school.” I’d never said these things to my mom or dad. I was keeping so much inside me. And I think that’s why I’d gotten close to joining a gang.</p>

<p>The other kids teased me for having this strange guy around. They called him my babysitter. I’d think, and sometimes even say to them, “You have your mom and your dad to give you attention. I have Tucker.” When middle school finished, Tucker asked if I wanted to continue into high school, and I said yes.</p>

<p>After my father’s second arrest, he was detained and then deported. He tried to cross the border, but was detained and deported again. Now, he is in Mexico, and I haven’t seen him in five years.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t say we really have a relationship, but we do talk. He calls me sometimes and we catch up. The last time was four months ago. It’s usually when he needs money. One year, I waited for him to call me on my birthday, and he never did. Tucker gave me a soccer ball.</p>

<p>Some people don’t get to have a dad at all, and I know I have one out there, which is still comforting, even if he isn’t in my life. I used to be so angry at him. I once said, “I didn’t get to have a childhood because of you.” But now, I feel a little more that everybody makes mistakes, and if it was my son who said that to me, it would hurt. I apologized for speaking harshly to him.</p>

<p>He said, “For you to say what you feel takes guts.” In a way, he was proud of me for being honest. And we both know I learned from him. I work at a grocery store now, and I bought myself a truck with my own money. I feel so proud saying: “This is mine.” And I know I learned that pride in work from him.</p>

<p>I grew out of my anger and moved on, because I realized the anger wasn’t going to help me in life. No matter how much he messes up, no matter how far away I push him, he’s always going to be my dad.</p>

<p>Kevin was a mentee for six years in the Seedling Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Austin, Texas, that provides volunteer mentors from the community for children of incarcerated parents. He asked to be identified by first name due to his immigration status.</p>

<h2 id="theconnecticutexperiment">The Connecticut Experiment</h2>

<p>by: Maurice Chammah</p>

<p>John Pittman, left, is Davon Eldemire's mentor and is helping him plan for life after release. Karsten Moran for The Marshall Project</p>

<p>eona Godfrey was sitting down to dinner at a TGI Fridays in Orange, Connecticut, in December 2013 when she glanced at a television and saw her little brother’s name on the local news. Davon Eldemire had tried to rob a small grocery store, shooting and injuring the owner. “I was devastated,” Godfrey recalled. “What was he thinking? I couldn’t eat.”</p>

<p>He was 20. She was 10 years older and had helped raise him, looking on in shame as he piled up an arrest record for drugs, larceny, and shooting an illegal gun in public. Lately, he had been talking about buying his daughter, Saniyah, a bed for Christmas. She figured the robbery was how he had planned to get the money. What he got instead was Christmas in jail, and then 14 years in prison for assault and attempted robbery.</p>

<p>At first Godfrey didn’t visit, less out of anger than inertia. But early last year, their mother, Linda Godfrey, started begging Leona to come see something neither would have expected: the prison seemed sincere about helping Davon turn his life around. Linda had attended a presentation by John Pittman, an older prisoner who was going to be Davon’s mentor, pushing him away from gangs and towards planning for his life after release. Linda was deeply moved. “He touched my heart,” she said of Pittman.</p>

<p>Davon had been selected for a pilot program called TRUE at Cheshire Correctional Institution. The effort represents the edge of experimentation for prison officials trying to help a population — young adults, roughly 18-25 — long known as the most likely to end up in prison and to commit more crimes after their release. Public officials have recently started to listen to neuroscientists who say the developing brains of young adults are still prone to impulse. They’re not juveniles under the law, but like younger teens, their minds are plastic and receptive to change. Vermont is raising the age of who is considered a “youthful offender” to 21, Washington is allowing certain crimes committed by those up to 25 to stay in juvenile courts, legislators in Texas are studying how “gaps in services” contribute to crime among 17- to 25-year-olds, and Chicago and San Francisco have set up special courts for young adults.</p>

<p>Uniquely, Connecticut is focusing attention on young men who are already in prison. Inspired by a youth prison in Germany, the state has placed about 50 of them in a single unit, along with a small group of older prisoners who serve as mentors. Many American prisons have classes, jobs, and rehabilitative programs, at least on paper. But in the TRUE program, the older prisoners have been granted the trust and latitude to develop a radically different environment, somewhere between family and reformatory, with strict rules, incentives and long days of work and study. The young men go through a series of stages, learning to confront their pasts, to be vulnerable around their peers, to resolve conflicts through communication instead of violence, and to master basic life skills they may have missed, such as managing a personal budget.</p>

<p>It’s too soon to tell what this experiment will yield. The program is tiny, encompassing only two percent of their age group in the Connecticut prison system, and much of its early success relies on the particular men involved. Though it has curbed violence inside the prison — and though none of the nine men released from the program have been incarcerated for new crimes — the real test will come over the next few years as the department tries to expand the program and participants return home in larger numbers. Though researchers see promise in the idea of using mentors, it can be tough to isolate their effect in programs such as TRUE, where prisoners are getting lots of different support services all at once. “The literature on mentoring is limited,” said Angela Hawken, a New York University professor who studies programs that try to keep people from returning to prison. “There's still a lot to be learned about whether this approach works."</p>

<p>But despite the lack of a track record, the Connecticut program is proving influential. The Vera Institute of Justice in New York, which helped Connecticut develop TRUE, is setting up similar young adult programs at the jail in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, near Boston, and in the South Carolina Department of Corrections. Even as the rhetoric out of the White House tends toward the punitive, many state prison leaders are openly championing rehabilitation.</p>

<p>That’s at the macro level. But zoom in and rehabilitation becomes personal: In the TRUE unit, the mentors try to get each of these young men to explain what brought them to prison and to articulate why they want to change. For Davon Eldemire, it came down to his daughter. Soon after he was incarcerated, he was chatting with his sister Leona by phone when he heard Saniyah pipe up in the background.</p>

<p>He started to choke up. “What have I done?” he said.</p>

<p>hree years ago, Connecticut corrections commissioner Scott Semple spent a week touring prisons in Germany, where incarcerated men and women cook their own food and wear their own clothes in an environment which, except for the razor wire, looks like a liberal arts college. A dozen other states have sent similar delegations to European prisons, and officials are starting to copy bits and pieces of what they have seen there. Semple, himself a former corrections officer, was particularly struck by Neustrelitz Prison, in Germany’s northeastern countryside, where nearly 200 young men and women live together on a farm, exposed to intensive therapy while raising animals and working in a welding shop. The environment was foreign, but local German officials discussed their challenges in a way that felt familiar. “This is the place for violence because they are young, they are aggressive, they have no control,” said Jörg Jesse, the head of prisons for the region.</p>

<p>Less than 24 hours after he returned home, Semple found himself Googling his way through the brain science literature on young adults and crime. Since the 1990s, studies of MRI scans have shown that the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with planning and solving problems, keeps developing pathways to other parts of the brain, including those related to emotions and impulses, well into the second decade of life. This is usually the given explanation for why a disproportionate number of crimes are committed by young people, but Semple noticed that was also true in prison, where people under 26 were responsible for a quarter of all “reportable incidents,” despite being less than a fifth of the population.</p>

<p>Semple asked the Vera Institute of Justice, which organized the Germany trip, to help him develop a youth prison like Neustrelitz. He envisioned dedicating an entire facility, but budget issues forced him to scale it back to a pilot project. He picked the Cheshire Correctional Institution. As the staff discussed possibilities, Scott Erfe, the facility’s warden, noted that older prisoners tended to “adopt” younger ones and give them advice. At community events, he’d seen a lifer named John Pittman get kids to toss away their street scowls and open up about their vulnerabilities. He wanted Pittman to pick others like him to live with and mentor the young prisoners.</p>

<p>John Pittman, who is serving 60 years for murder, has mentored younger men at Cheshire Correctional Institution. Karsten Moran for The Marshall Project</p>

<p>Pittman, a tall, soft-spoken man who has earned the nickname “Father Time,” is serving 60 years for the 1985 murder of his wife in Hartford. He won’t speak about the crime, saying only, “Some of us have taken lives, so it’s only fair that we try to save lives.” Semple was skeptical of the mentorship idea, since there is also a history of older prisoners preying on young ones, financially and sexually, and in Germany the rehabilitation programs were run by staff. But Erfe convinced him. (Such exploitation, so far as officials can tell, has not taken place in the TRUE unit.) As Erfe explained it, “Part of this is guards and counselors realizing they can’t speak to these young men with knowledge of what they’re really thinking; only older prisoners from the same neighborhoods can.”</p>

<p>And so the German model took on an American influence. “Sometimes you see what you need is in your backyard,” Pittman said.</p>

<p>Left-leaning supporters of prisoner rehabilitation tend to talk about the social and economic forces that lead to crime, while conservatives focus on personal responsibility and poor choices. These two approaches are not in conflict in the ethos of the TRUE program: a bad environment causes bad decisions, but it’s up to you to rise above it. “The violence and intermittent chaos of street life translates to prison life with ease,” the mentors wrote in an introductory note to the young men. “Perhaps there has been no consideration of how the movement from point to point has stripped you of your voice and made you feel powerless...This does not have to continue to be your reality.” The mentors turned the wing — an open floor, dotted with tables and surrounded by tiers of cells — into a temple of self-improvement. A day of work and study can last from 7:30 a.m. until 7:30 p.m. Chalkboards feature quotes attributed to Booker T. Washington and the Buddha.</p>

<p>They devised ways to keep everyone accountable. If officers see someone breaking a small rule — an untucked shirt, a radio left on, tardiness to a class — they can write it down, without the offending prisoner’s name, on a chalkboard, and then it’s up to his peers to figure out who broke the rule and ask him to fix the problem. When two young men have a dispute, they sit with others in a circle and discuss what transpired and how to resolve the problem; it doesn’t escalate towards violence and harsh disciplinary tactics such as solitary confinement. Punishments can include doing push-ups and learning dictionary words. There is an emphasis on practical life skills; they get mock currency, and they pay mock rent and taxes. They can get bonus pay for doing extra work, such as cleaning a common area, and fined for disruptive behavior.</p>

<p>But the main thrust of the programming is emotional growth, to get the men to analyze how their own anger and sadness alchemized into decisions that harmed others, and then to chart another path. There is a lot of talking. They talk about Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. In “Hip Hop Hermeneutics” class, they discuss lyrics as a way to explore the pressures they felt growing up. In the “Current Events” class, they view the news of the day through a personal lens. One popular subject was Aaron Hernandez, the New England Patriots football player convicted of murder who later committed suicide in a Massachusetts prison. Even as he achieved fame and fortune, they noted, Hernandez remained connected to friends in gangs. They spoke of trying to escape their pasts while feeling pressure from old friends to prove they are not “getting soft.”</p>

<p>“You go back out, seeing guys run, and you don’t run?” Davon Eldemire told the class one day last November. “The change is scary.”</p>

<p>hen Eldemire first arrived in prison, he spent time mostly with men he knew from outside. When one was attacked, they banded together and fought back. “I was a tough guy, you couldn’t tell me nothing,” he said. In 2014, he received a disciplinary report for getting into a fist fight. But while working in a prison kitchen, he met an older prisoner who gave him memoirs by Martin Luther King Jr. and the boxer Rubin “Hurricane” Carter. This man noticed that Eldemire talked a lot about Saniyah. “You say you love your daughter,” Eldemire recalls him saying. “But are you doing the right things?”</p>

<p>Back in his cell, Eldemire would find this challenge nagging at him: “On the streets nobody ever said, ‘Are you really living for your kids?’” He found himself growing bored as the friends who called always wanted to talk about the same petty schemes to make money, dealing drugs, chasing women, getting into fights.</p>

<p>Once in the program, he drew Pittman as his mentor, and they talked about his plans for when he gets out, his family relationships, his emotional responses to stress. “I think he’s really helped Davon see the value in being a father figure, how the way you live really affects those who look up to you,” said correctional officer James Vassar, who works in the unit. “And then he models that. He’s like the grandfather.” In essays, Eldemire reflected on his past. “Becoming a product of my environment had me chasing a dream that cannot manifest,” he wrote. “That dream was to sell drugs, promote violence without ending up in here.” He steeled himself to deal with teasing from prisoners who weren’t in the program. How’s that kindergarten going? they’d say.</p>

<p>Davon Eldemire, center, and other mentees in the TRUE Unit discuss the program at a meeting with Gov. Dannel Malloy of Connecticut.</p>

<p>Lili Holzer Glier/Vera Institute of Justice</p>

<p>It is unclear just how widespread such skepticism is among other prisoners, or whether it would imperil efforts to expand the program. Not all officers are sold on the idea, either. “Some told me there is a lack of structure” in the TRUE program, said Rudy Demiraj, president of AFSCME Local 387, a union representing officers. Giving the young men push-ups and dictionary words can seem like an insufficient deterrent for officers used to sending them to solitary confinement and revoking phone and commissary access. “We need to get back to holding people accountable for their own actions. It seems to us...that this program is not geared towards that,” he said. Demiraj would rather see such resources focused on prisoners with imminent release dates, and many in TRUE will be in prison for long stretches.</p>

<p>Demiraj said he’s open to being convinced by hard data that shows the program’s participants commit fewer crimes once they’re out, but such data could be years off. (Three years is a common timeframe for tracking new crimes.) In the meantime, Semple is hoping to expand — a comparable women’s unit is slated to open later this year. As the program grows, it will inevitably include young men who are not as committed as the first class. And myriad factors out of the department’s control affect whether someone commits a crime after leaving prison. “We know we won’t bat a thousand,” Semple said. “But there are also plenty of people with no history of incarceration, or even police interaction, who we read about on the front page. There is no magic wand.” He added that he instructed staff to pick prisoners who seemed like they needed help, not ones already committed to change. “If I wanted to impact recidivism, I would have picked cupcakes,” he said.</p>

<p>If the Connecticut story is a lesson in how criminal justice experiments happen these days, it is also a lesson in their limits. Of the nine men released from the TRUE program, one is back in prison after a technical parole violation. That is not officially a new criminal charge, but there is no telling how the public would respond if someone released from the program committed a serious crime. Even now, one state senator is pushing to restrict a different program that allows prisoners to earn early release through good behavior, citing one man released early who shot a police officer.</p>

<p>The TRUE program was cultivated with the express support of Democratic Gov. Dannel Malloy, who joined Semple for a day on the Germany trip and has also pushed a legislative initiative called the “Second Chance Society,” which includes reduced penalties for drug possession and an easier route to parole. But he is not seeking another term this November, and in a 2016 Quinnipiac University poll, 44 percent of Connecticut voters said they disapproved of how the governor was handling crime; only 40 percent approved. His predecessor, Republican Jodi Rell, vetoed efforts to shorten prison sentences while supporting “three strikes” laws. The TRUE program has not come up in the current race, which still features a wide-open field, but the next governor could easily replace Semple. Of the four department heads on his tour of Germany in 2015, he is the only one still in his position. It is impossible to tell whether the TRUE program would survive a change at the top.</p>

<p>Young adults at the TRUE Unit at Cheshire Correctional Institution are encouraged to express themselves and sometimes decorate their cell doors using chalk.</p>

<p>Lili Holzer Glier/Vera Institute of Justice</p>

<p>And even if the next governor likes the idea of TRUE on paper, budgetary constraints may keep it small. The current program cost $500,000 to set up, much of it coming from federal grants. A lot of that cost was for the initial training and overtime, but the necessity of having more staff than usual around may inhibit the project’s growth. Semple said a typical housing unit would have two officers during a day shift, but in TRUE there are four, which is more in line with how the department would staff a mental health or solitary confinement wing.</p>

<p>But if TRUE doesn’t grow or prove itself through data, Semple sees the program as worthwhile for how it has already cultivated a prison environment more like the one he saw in Germany. “We’ve taken a more dignified approach,” he said. That’s also the perspective of Alex Frank of the Vera Institute of Justice in New York, who has been commuting regularly to Cheshire to develop the program. She sees it as part of a larger movement in prisons that will survive, no matter what happens to this particular experiment. “The starting point is not, ‘Everyone is messed up.’ The starting point is, ‘Everyone has potential,’” she said. “We make this accessible to everyone, and if it doesn’t work, it’s on the system — hold the mirror up.”</p>

<p>n a January evening, Eldemire rushed out of the TRUE unit wing to the visitation room at the front of the prison, where his sister Leona and mother Linda were waiting with Saniyah, who is now six. Her hair was laced through red and white beads, which clacked together as her father scooped her up. She picked at his beard as he asked her to spell new words and inquired about her classes at school. Over the next hour, any time he’d put her down for a few moments, she’d look up at him and say, “Upsies! Upsies!” John Pittman snapped a family picture.</p>

<p>Davon’s sister Leona had never felt the need to see her brother since she could talk to him on the phone, but once she learned he was making an effort, she realized she needed to make one, too. One night, their mother Linda’s usual ride to the prison fell through. Leona said she was too tired to drive her. She laid down to rest. “Something is weighing heavy on my heart,” she recalled. “He’s going to see all those families, hugging and kissing their loved ones, and he’ll be alone...He’s going to think, ‘What am I doing this for?’” She drove 90 mph to get her mother and made it to the prison 15 minutes after the visiting time had begun.</p>

<p>“He knew all these big words all of a sudden,” she said. He was interested in learning real estate and flipping houses when he got out. He talked about investing money. When she brought up new clothes and shoes she liked, which used to be a frequent topic of discussion between them, he said, “You don’t need all that! Tear up that credit card!”</p>

<p>During regular visitation hours, visitors and prisoners sit across a table from another and are allowed only limited physical contact, but in the “family engagement” sessions of the TRUE program, the rules are relaxed, and the interactions look a lot like they do in Europe. They are allowed to sit next to their visitors and hold their kids. Counselors from the program call family members regularly to update them on their loved one’s progress. If they can’t find family who seems interested, they look for other people who can visit and keep the young man accountable, whether an old coach or a just a close friend. A 2011 Minnesota Department of Corrections study found that prisoners who regularly received visits were 13 percent less likely to be convicted of a new felony in their first five years of release. Often, Pittman has found that when he pushes young prisoners to explain bad behavior, they will say they are having trouble getting in touch with their families.</p>

<p>The TRUE mentors and department staff are working with two nonprofits, Workforce Alliance and COMPASS Youth Collaborative, to set up the mentees with jobs and support services such as counseling and education once they’re out. Those who have been released call the staff with updates on their progress, and there is talk of creating a “TRUE Alumni network.” But all this is in its infancy since so few men have been released.</p>

<p>Davon will be up for parole in three years, and it remains to be seen whether involvement in the TRUE program will help prisoners like him when they go before the parole board. His sentence officially ends in 2027. Until then, Leona dreads the moment when Saniyah comes to understand that her father is in prison; for now, she just thinks he’s in a “special school.” “She’ll say, ‘Why did you guys lie to me?,’” said Leona. “I’ll say, ‘It was to protect your heart.’”</p>

<p>When it was time to leave, Saniyah gripped her father tight. “I love you so much,” she said.</p>

<p>“Be a good girl, okay?” he said.</p>

<h2 id="amurdercaseunravels">A Murder Case Unravels</h2>

<p>by: Andrew Cohen</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-05</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/06/a-murder-case-unravels </p>

<p>Johnny Lee Gates’ journey through the Georgia justice system already is the stuff of legal legend and one of the longest-running capital cases in the nation’s history. A black man convicted by an all-white jury of murdering a white woman in Muscogee County in 1977, he was quickly sentenced to death. Now, 41 years later, defense attorneys and prosecutors are back in court Monday fighting over some of the most persuasive evidence yet that Gates’ trial was an unconstitutionally prejudiced exercise.</p>

<p>Defense attorneys have evidence that prosecutors systematically excluded black prospective jurors in his case. In February, after a bitter public records battle, a judge ordered state attorneys to turn over the notes Gates’ prosecutors took during the jury selection. The notes showed precisely the sort of racial bias the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 held unconstitutional in another Georgia case involving prosecutorial misconduct and a black defendant, a case involving one of the prosecutors who also helped send Gates to death row.</p>

<p>The notes show that in Gates’ case white prospective jurors were labeled with a “W” and black prospective jurors were labeled with an “N.” An expert employed by the defense swears that the probability that all of the black jurors were struck at random is 0.000000000000000000000000000004. That’s 29 zeroes. The math is debatable, but a finding by the judge that the jury selection was transparently racist could mean a new trial for Gates. Why would prosecutors worry about a new trial in a case involving a confession they’ve defended for decades? Because the case against Gates was shaky from the start.</p>

<p>On Nov. 30, 1976, three weeks after fellow Georgian Jimmy Carter was elected president, Katharina Wright was robbed, raped, and murdered in her apartment in Columbus in the middle of a weekday. Her body was found, bound, with a bullet wound in her head. One witness promptly told police she saw a white man running away from the building around the time of the murder. Another witness, who lived just below the apartment where the murder took place, told the cops that a black man around 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing about 170 pounds had come around earlier that day saying he was with the gas company and asking whether the neighbor wanted his gas turned off.</p>

<p>Johnny Lee Gates in the 1970s.</p>

<p>A white man named Lester Sanders was questioned by the police after he was found fondling the victim’s body while it lay in its casket at a funeral home. The cops later told a grand jury that Sanders began confessing to the Wright murder, telling the police details about the crime that only the true killer would have known. But Sanders never was charged, and four decades later no one has explained why. Two months after the murder, in January 1977, Gates was arrested with two others and charged with trying to rob a store. And that’s when the investigation into the murder of Katharina Wright took a dramatic turn.</p>

<p>An informant told the police that Gates had borrowed a gun, claimed to have murdered Wright, and then given the gun back to the informant who then threw the weapon into a nearby creek. The gun was later discovered, test-fired, and found not to have been used to kill Wright. Nor were any fingerprints other than those of the victim and her husband initially found by the cops at the crime scene. But it didn’t matter because by the time the forensics came back the police had a “confession” from Gates — and not just a typed-up one. For the first time in the history of the police department of Columbus, Georgia, the cops taped one of its “confessions,” taped it at the scene of the crime for added effect, and its use at the trial doomed Gates.</p>

<p>Gates’ confession was detailed. He signed a typed document that said he had identified himself as a gas company employee and went to Wright’s apartment dressed as a civilian. Katharina said she had called the gas company because her heater wasn’t working. Why did she let him in? We’ll never know. Gates then allegedly told her he was robbing her to which she responded that she had no money but could give him sex instead. They had consensual sex, according to the confession, and then the story has Gates shooting the woman to death after she said that she would be able to identify him once he left the apartment.</p>

<p>The Next To Die </p>

<p>To emphasize their version of events the police took Gates to Wright’s apartment to videotape his “re-enactment” of the crime. The tape shown to jurors had Gates traipsing around the apartment and, pointedly, touching the heater from which fingerprints ultimately would be taken and used against him at trial. Gates then, and later, was considered intellectually disabled, and profoundly so. School records showed the extent of his deficiencies in adaptive reasoning, and his background in special education, a history police and prosecutors knew or should have known about in 1977. But it wasn’t until 1992 that post-conviction attorneys first raised that issue on Gates’s behalf after discovering school records and his post-conviction IQ testing, which showed him in the range of “retardation,” as it was called then.</p>

<p>The police took that taped and written “confession” and supplemented it with the testimony of that downstairs neighbor, the man who swore that Gates was the man he had seen the day of the murder. He swore to this in court even though Gates was 40 pounds lighter and four inches shorter than the 5-foot-10-inch, 170-pound man the witness had described. Prosecutors also told jurors that Gates’ fingerprint had been found at the scene even though the initial police search of the apartment had not turned up any foreign prints. Did Gates touch something during his police-video performance inside the apartment? Like the heater to which he had been directed? Is that how his prints got there?</p>

<p>That was just one of the questions never answered at trial. No surprise, really, since the whole trial took fewer than three days to complete. It took jurors 95 minutes to convict Gates. It took them 58 more minutes to recommend the death sentence against him after a “penalty phase” of a trial that lasted less than two hours. His attorneys raised a number of issues on appeal, trying primarily to get out from under the confession, but they all went nowhere. “We have already noted that the verdict of the jury was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor,” the Georgia Court of Appeals pointedly declared in a 1979 ruling that first upheld Gates’ conviction and sentence.</p>

<p>The story fast-forwards now to 2016. By this time Gates had gotten off the state’s death row because of the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2002 decision outlawing the execution of the intellectually disabled. Faced at last with his school records and cognitive testing results Georgia attorneys agreed to revert his death sentence to a sentence of life without parole. But it is another Supreme Court decision, in 2016, that brings everyone back to court on Monday. In Foster v. Chatman, the justices concluded that Douglas Pullen, the same prosecutor who had tried Gates, had illegally discriminated against a black capital defendant by striking all four black prospective jurors from the case. Pullen had tried to explain those choices, saying he had a “race-neutral” reason for each one, but the court didn’t buy it and Timothy Foster was granted a new trial.</p>

<p>The Foster decision convinced Gates’ current lawyers to renew their claims that his trial, too, was infected by racial bias. And why not? The Foster case had uncovered a pattern by the two prosecutors who handled the Gates case, Pullen and William Smith, in which virtually all black prospective jurors were eliminated from consideration in capital cases involving black defendants. The record in the five cases in which Pullen struck black jurors from the pool was 27-for-27. In the four cases in which Smith made the call he was only able to strike all the black potential jurors three times because in the fourth case, after using 10 strikes to exclude 10 black people, there were still other black prospective jurors.</p>

<p>It says something about the changing nature of Georgia justice that there will even be a hearing to discuss whether Gates should get a new trial. The presiding judge, John Allen, a decorated Vietnam War fighter pilot, knows this case well. He presided over Gates’ successful attempt to get out from under his death sentence 15 years ago. It’s hard to imagine the state’s appellate courts overturning a decision he’d make to give Gates a new trial.</p>

<p>The Gates case is notable as another test of how far the courts are going to go to remedy past episodes of racial misconduct by officials in capital cases involving black defendants and white victims. A new trial here, over the objections of prosecutors, could finally tell us what happened to that white suspect, how Gates’ prints suddenly turned up at a crime scene where before they were absent, and why a robbery suspect would start to fix a gas heater in the home of a woman he then shot in the head. Or, it could convince prosecutors to abandon altogether the case against Gates.</p>

<h2 id="thelegacyofalynching">The Legacy of a Lynching</h2>

<p>by: Robin Washington</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-03</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/03/the-legacy-of-a-lynching </p>

<p>On the afternoon of June 15, 1920, Louis Dondino drove his one-ton green pickup truck back and forth along the streets of Duluth, Minnesota, shouting to onlookers to “Join the necktie party.” The night before, Irene Tusken, 19, and her boyfriend, Jimmie Sullivan, 18, both of Dondino’s working class West Duluth neighborhood, attended the one-day stand of the John Robinson Circus. There, the couple claimed, six black circus workers robbed them at gunpoint and raped Tusken. The next morning, a physician examining Tusken determined she showed no signs of assault, yet the pair stuck to their story. Police responded by apprehending several black roustabouts from the departing circus train, hauling six to the jail on Superior Street, the city’s main drag.</p>

<p>By nightfall, as many as one in ten of the city’s 100,000 residents had gathered in front of the jail, with police attempting a futile defense under orders not to use their guns. The mob broke through, beating the prisoners and propping them up in a brief kangaroo court. Three — Elias Clayton, Elmer Jackson and Isaac McGhie, the last detained by police only as a witness — were dragged a block away to the corner of First Street and Second Avenue East. A rope was thrown over a lamppost. One by one, each man was lynched. The throng parted to allow a car through to illuminate the scene with its headlights for a photographer. Clayton’s body was cut down from the rope to better fit in the frame. The image was later sold on postcards.</p>

<p>The lynchings in Duluth — about as far north as you can go in the United States — are among more than 4,000 extrajudicial murders of African Americans tallied by the Equal Justice Initiative for its Legacy Museum and National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which opened in Montgomery. Ala., last week. Among the thousands attending was a delegation of 35 from Duluth, making the 1,223-mile trip by bus. Similar pilgrimages hailed from around the country, but the point of debarkation for the Duluth group is unique among the country’s ghastly racist killing sites, most of them in 12 southern states: Kitty-corner from where the lamppost stood in 1920 is the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, the nation’s most prominent commemoration of a lynching at the site of the crime, predating the Montgomery memorial by 15 years.</p>

<p>Under the gaze of those sculptured renditions of Clayton, Jackson and McGhie, friends and family have gathered to see the bus off. One man, flashing a warm smile, wears a smart business suit and a name badge identifying him as the host of the Minnesota Chiefs of Police conference, underway a few blocks away. He is Mike Tusken, Duluth’s current chief of police. He is also the great-nephew of Irene Tusken, the accuser of the lynched men.</p>

<p>“This has been a journey for me, being that I didn’t find out for years my family’s history,” he says. He first learned about his great-aunt’s role in the incident during the construction of the memorial in 2003. It now has “a soft spot in my heart,” he says, and the new national memorial also tugs on him. The police conference would oblige him to forego the bus, but he would fly south the next day.</p>

<p>“I can’t miss this,” he says.” It’s too big for our nation, too big for our city.”</p>

<p>Those making the bus pilgrimage include others inextricably tied to the memorial. With a clipboard checking everyone in is Heidi Bakk-Hansen, who in 2000 as a novice writer for a short-lived alternative newspaper wrote the definitive article, “Duluth’s Lingering Shame: Clayton, Jackson, McGhie Lynching.” The piece revealed the details behind Duluth’s most infamous day, most notably naming names that had been hushed for decades. The article sparked the interest of Henry Banks, a store owner turned activist, who organized a committee for a memorial and brought it to fruition. Banks is also on the trip. The other travelers are black and white, seniors and teens not yet born when the memorial was first envisioned.</p>

<p>They depart, the itinerary including civil rights shrines in Memphis and Birmingham. But before those cities there is a stop in Cairo, Ill. — or what’s left of it. At least three-quarters of the city’s structures are vacant, attributed by some to an unsettled racial history that included a 1909 lynching for which there is no commemoration of any sort. Standing under a lamppost, Bakk-Hansen rectifies that omission, reading aloud from an account of the killing of Will “Froggie” James, carried out by the white women of the town.</p>

<p>In Montgomery, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice (a gentler, more forward-looking name than “National Lynching Memorial,” which people tend to call it nonetheless) is more than a single edifice; the total complex includes sculpture gardens, a contemplative memorial square, and a massive structure with rusted steel monoliths engraved with names hanging from the ceiling.</p>

<p>A duplicate set is displayed in an outdoor area, waiting to be claimed at some future date by the communities where the tragedies occurred. On each are the names, dates of death, and county and state where a black person was lynched, sometimes several on a single day.</p>

<p>Duluth’s three names “are like a drop in the bucket,” says Carl Crawford, the city’s human rights officer.</p>

<p>At least Duluth knows the names of its martyrs. Hundred of the victims memorialized in Montgomery are documented simply as “Unknown.”</p>

<p>“St. Clair, Illinois,” reads Crawford. “There’s about 25 names. All unknown. All on the same day.”</p>

<p>The main structure is a Mies van der Rohe-influenced square, in which visitors make their way around three 90-degree turns. At each turn, more of the steel markers come into view, until the scale of the atrocities becomes overwhelming. Many visitors break down and cry. A wall of plaques on the left presents the ostensible reasons for the killings. Crawford reads aloud:</p>

<p>ViewFinder </p>

<p>“‘David Hunter was lynched in Lawrence County, South Carolina, in 1898, for leaving a farm where he worked without permission. Calvin Kimblern was lynched by a mob of people in Pueblo, Colorado’ — more evidence that this just wasn’t a Southern thing. This was an American thing. ‘Robert Morton was lynched in Rockfield, Kentucky in 1897, for writing a note to a white woman.’”</p>

<p>In the Legacy Museum itself, the exhibits put lynching in context as part of a systematic campaign to keep African Americans subjugated and powerless after emancipation, drawing a straight line from slavery to lynching to present-day mass incarceration of black people. Visitors may not make it that far, however. Many burst into tears at the museum’s first exhibit: haunting holographs of enslaved mothers asking you if you know where their children were sold.</p>

<p>The Duluth delegation is joined by an honorary member: Warren Read of the Seattle area, who was doing a genealogical search when he stumbled across the article by Bakk-Hansen. There he found the name of his great-grandfather: Louis Dondino, the man who organized the lynch mob. He kept searching, and tracked down the family of Elmer Jackson. He reached out to a cousin of the murdered man, Virginia Huston, from Jackson’s hometown of Pennytown, Missouri, and the two have met up to visit the memorial and museum together.</p>

<p>The Duluth, Minn. delegation to the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Ala. gathers in front of the Clayton, Jackson, McGhie Memorial to that city's 1920 lynching before boarding a bus for a 1,223-mile journey to Alabama in April.</p>

<p>Julia Cheng</p>

<p>At an impromptu gathering with the Duluth group outside the Legacy Museum, Huston, now in her seventies, introduces Read, 51, to those new to the story.</p>

<p>“Warren is my baby brother now,” she says. “He brought the research to us to let us know what happened. We didn’t know what happened to Elmer, but with his research, we now know. We have closure.”</p>

<p>“Warren’s great-grandfather, he was instrumental in getting the lynch mob,” she recalls. “But that’s not Warren. He shouldn’t have any guilt feelings or anything. We’re going to look forward, we’re not looking back. We’re going to build ourselves up, and live for today and live for tomorrow. He will always be my brother and I love him very much.”</p>

<p>Shocked as he was to discover this horror in his family’s history, Read says living with his family’s past is easier for him than others. He lives 1,500 miles away from the scene of the crime and few would know the story if he didn’t volunteer it.</p>

<p>“I tell people we bear a certain responsibility to right the wrongs that our forefathers did,” he says. “But I also understand that I don’t live in Duluth, my last name’s not Dondino, so I have certain amount of safety and distance and emotional distance from it.”</p>

<p>Mike Tusken doesn’t have that luxury. The police chief lives in Duluth and carries the family name of the false accuser. And his chosen profession, in which he has risen through the ranks from an officer working a beat, has put him in contact with many who might suspect his attitude toward African Americans reflects the animus of his forebears.</p>

<p>“I wonder if people in the community, especially the African-American community, if I show up at a call, are they thinking, ‘Oh yeah, I know what you're all about.’ Do they think I got to the top of the Police Department because, ‘He’s that racist'?” he said in a 2010 column in the Duluth News Tribune, which first identified his family connection to the accuser.</p>

<p>The edifice at First Street and Second Avenue East has become a place of solace, he says. And now, like thousands of others, Tusken has found another one, and like other somber visitors, rounds its right angles, becoming helplessly overwhelmed by the magnitude of the senseless carnage.</p>

<p>But it isn’t enough to grieve, he says.</p>

<p>“Leaving this memorial, I think everyone has to ask themselves, ‘What are you personally going to do to confront racism? To make sure that people have access and equality?’ And that really is the takeaway everyone should leave with: What are you going to do?”</p>

<h2 id="howprosecutorreformisshakingupsmalldaraces">How Prosecutor Reform Is Shaking Up Small DA Races</h2>

<p>by: Joseph Neff</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-30</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/05/01/how-prosecutor-reform-is-shaking-up-small-da-races </p>

<p>In North Carolina, campaigns for district attorney have long followed a traditional narrative: lots of talk about being tough on crime, accompanied by the occasional gun raffle fundraiser.</p>

<p>Satana Deberry’s campaign this year in Durham, a left-leaning enclave of about 260,000 people, is not typical. Deberry is running against the system, one of a few dozen candidates around the country who say they want to shake things up from inside the corner office. “The only indisputable outcome of our criminal justice system is that black and brown people are incarcerated,” Deberry said in a recent interview. “We aren’t safer as a community.”</p>

<p>Across the country, a new breed of prosecutors has been elected in Philadelphia, Chicago, Houston and other places, promising to end death penalty prosecutions, drastically cut back on cash bail and pull back on low-level charges. Many have had outside help, including from political action committees associated with billionaire philanthropist George Soros.</p>

<p>That assistance hasn’t trickled down to Durham, where this month’s Democratic primary is likely to determine the next DA. But in a sign that the ethos and goals of the prosecutor reform movement has begun to influence less visible races, the Durham campaign has become a competition between candidates to tout their progressive bona fides.</p>

<p>Deberry has echoed the pledges of other reform-minded candidates, as well as saying that if she’s elected, her entire staff, including her, would undergo routine training to combat unconscious race or sex bias. Racial bias may seem an odd focus in Durham, where the police chief, senior trial judge and chief public defender are African-American, as is incumbent District Attorney Roger Echols.</p>

<p>“Individually, they’d all say the system is screwed up,” said Deberry, who is also black. “But they’ve been trained to work a certain way in the system, and the system is racist.”</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Echols described himself as North Carolina’s most progressive district attorney. He touted his mental health court, which steers defendants into treatment rather than prison. Last year he helped lead a program that dismissed 2,100 traffic tickets and allowed 458 people to get their driver’s licenses back. His office recently steered a violent felony case through a restorative justice pilot program, the first such case in North Carolina.</p>

<p>A third candidate, defense attorney Daniel Meier, is also running as a reformer.</p>

<p>Lisa Williams, a prominent Durham defense attorney, said Deberry has forced a debate about bail, fines, fees and other ignored issues. “If Ms. Deberry is elected, there will be wholesale changes,” Williams said. “That office will look radically different in policy and personnel.”</p>

<p>For decades district attorney campaigns have been low-profile, down-ballot contests in the 46 states where they are elected. Most incumbents faced only token opposition; most candidates were white men. As police shootings, wrongful convictions and climbing incarceration rates entered headlines, the words of former U.S. Attorney General Robert Jackson became increasingly relevant: “The prosecutor has more control over life, liberty, and reputation than any other person in America.”</p>

<p>Soros’ committees have spent millions on local DA races. This year, advocates aligned with him are looking to expand that political effort to cities including Baltimore, Los Angeles, St. Louis and others. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and Color of Change are speaking to voters about criminal justice issues through canvassing and voter registration.</p>

<p>Life Inside </p>

<p>Even without a helping hand, Deberry has a chance of winning, given Durham’s unapologetically liberal bent.</p>

<p>She grew up in a family of teachers in the railroad town of Hamlet, N.C. A graduate of Princeton University and Duke law school, she moved home to practice criminal and family law. For the past 18 years she’s worked on behalf of poor people in housing, consumer finance and human services.</p>

<p>Where Deberry is passionate and charismatic, Echols, a career prosecutor, is cerebral and reserved, traits welcomed by those working at the county courthouse. Echols took office in 2014 after scandals forced out his two predecessors.</p>

<p>Deberry said Echols is a decent and honest man who brought needed calm to the office, but that’s not enough. African-Americans make up 38 percent of Durham’s population and 80 percent of the jail population, she said.</p>

<p>“Yes, we have a lot of consistency,” she said. “The same consistent outcomes for the last 50 years.”</p>

<p>Deberry has hammered Echols on jail and bail. Echols responded that cash bail is inequitable and unjust: “Find a DA who’s doing more about it than me in this state.”</p>

<p>That claim met with disbelief from Williams and other defense attorneys, who said Echols’ staff consistently urges judges to stick to the high amounts on Durham’s presumptive bond schedule.</p>

<p>Winning in Durham often boils down to who is endorsed by three influential community groups. One has backed Deberry, while two others backed Echols. (There is no public polling in the race.) Deberry lost the endorsement of the local alternative weekly after she landed in hot water for appearing to plagiarize the website of Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, whom she says she admires.</p>

<p>Echols said it was unfair for Deberry to assume that the cities’ problems were identical. “She’s molded Durham after Philadelphia, and that’s not accurate,” Echols said.</p>

<p>Echols has also stumbled. In August, after white supremacists and counter-protesters clashed in Charlottesville, demonstrators converged on the old Durham courthouse and pulled down a statue of a Confederate soldier in front of television and cell phone cameras. The toppling made national news and created headaches for Echols, who filed charges against a dozen protesters. After a judge tossed out all charges midway through the two first trials and acquitted a third defendant, Echols dismissed the remaining cases.</p>

<p>Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said that charges against the Confederate statue protestors were dismissed in one trial.</p>

<p>s the judge climbed the watchtower stairs in Pelican Bay prison, he heard muffled gunshots below. When he reached the top, he looked into the prison yard and saw bodies lying in the dirt. One was his law clerk, spreadeagled on the ground in his suit, alongside dozens of inmates. Guards stood over them, guns aimed.</p>

<p>“My clerk was thinking he’s gonna die and this is his last day on earth,” Judge Thelton Henderson recalled.</p>

<p>What appeared to be the taming of a riot was actually an audacious performance, staged by the guards to impress upon the judge that prison was a dangerous place, best left alone by meddling outsiders.</p>

<p>That prison pageant in September 1993 was a tacit acknowledgement of the power one extraordinary judge held over California’s prison system. During his 37 years on the bench, Henderson did more than anyone to transform California’s notoriously overcrowded prisons into a great experiment in second chances.</p>

<p>Now, newly retired and stricken by an autoimmune disease, the judge is watching the first serious backlash to his legacy. A campaign led by law enforcement organizations is gathering support for a measure on the November ballot that would roll back some of California’s reforms — a transformation Henderson believes is still unfinished.</p>

<p>“I think it’s awful,” Henderson said. “It’s a regressive move. It’s a step backward if it happens.”</p>

<p>Henderson, 84, became a lawyer during the civil rights era, and that moral framework and activist energy guided his work. When he joined the federal bench, he presided over a series of prison cases that ultimately forced radical changes in the system.</p>

<p>He started with Pelican Bay, finding in 1995 that the state’s new supermax prison was so plagued by problems that the courts had to take over. He appointed a federal monitor. In 2001, he presided over a lawsuit claiming that prison medical services were inadequate. This case merged with another to become Brown v. Plata, in which a three-judge panel, including Henderson, found the state’s prison system was so overcrowded that inmates were dying unnecessarily at the rate of 60 a year. The judges ordered California to reduce the number of prisoners. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court agreed.</p>

<p>“I was going in uncharted territory, but I justified it in my mind because every six days a person is dying,” Henderson said. “And I thought, we talk about life and liberty and life is the most important of those things. Human lives are being lost. So I thought this justified pushing my powers as far as I possibly can to save those lives.”</p>

<p>Along the way, the judge’s focus on social justice collided with the political pragmatism of the state’s governor, Jerry Brown, who served as the state’s chief executive from 1975 to 1983, and again starting in 2011. Eventually, the judge prevailed. In an experiment that’s been called “an act of mass forgiveness unprecedented in U.S. history,” California passed laws that released tens of thousands of prisoners and prevented thousands more from going to prison.</p>

<p>But the judge hoped the state could go even further, and just before retiring from the bench he met with Gov. Brown, the latest encounter in years of conversation, mostly at Henderson’s kitchen table in Berkeley.</p>

<p>“He opened it up by saying ‘I’ve done everything I can. What else can I do? What do you want me to do?’” Henderson said. “I think these were very good efforts. I think he did do everything that was politically feasible, possible, for him to do. It was a good effort.”</p>

<p>“It didn’t completely solve the problem.”</p>

<p>For one thing, he told the governor, there is too little support for prisoners reentering society. For another, the system is still plagued by racial disparities; at the end of 2016 African-American men made up six percent of the state’s population, but 29 percent of its prisoners.</p>

<p>The state’s corrections budget remains the nation’s largest. Unlike the federal government and many states, California has no sentencing commission, which could recommend system-wide reforms.</p>

<p>enderson grew up, an only child, in South-Central Los Angeles, a poor, mostly African-American area. His mother lived with white families, cooking and cleaning for them. He knew people who’d been in the criminal justice system, including two of his uncles.</p>

<p>“A lot of my high school classmates got into trouble with the law, and I knew them to be nice people,” he says. “A lot of buddies who I grew up with, not much awaited them out there. And I think I had an empathy for these people. I didn’t see them as bad people. I saw them as people that got a bad break.”</p>

<p>A star halfback, Henderson won a scholarship to the University of California, Berkeley, then served in the Army before going to law school. As the first African-American lawyer in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, he saw how the courts could be used to fight discrimination. He investigated voter suppression in Louisiana and the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama.</p>

<p>One night, a civil rights activist with car trouble asked to borrow Henderson’s government-rented car. Henderson agreed. The activist was Martin Luther King, Jr., on his way to the marches in Selma. The incident was seized by critics as evidence the Kennedy administration was providing direct support to civil rights activists. Henderson was forced to resign.</p>

<p>“I think his social justice gene is so impenetrable that I don’t think he could help himself,” says Melinda Haag, the former U.S. Attorney in San Francisco. “It never occurred to him not to go up and see the prison, or to take over the medical care, or to give Martin Luther King his car. He thought, ‘Of course I’m going to give him the car.’ He just doesn’t shy away from any of it.”</p>

<p>(Haag would later prosecute two guards for mistreating inmates at Pelican Bay. The litany of abuses included staging the fake riot meant to send a message to Henderson. A jury convicted the guards of conspiracy to violate inmates’ civil rights and sentenced them to six and seven years in prison.)</p>

<p>Expelled from the Kennedy administration, Henderson returned to California. He argued civil rights cases and served as a dean at Stanford Law School, where he pressed for admitting more students of color. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to the federal bench.</p>

<p>Henderson brought an unusual perspective to the court. One day in the court’s cafeteria, another judge mentioned a race discrimination trial that was underway. A group of black workers had sued their employer, claiming that their co-workers had hung pictures of baboons and scrawled racial epithets on their lockers.</p>

<p>“He said, you know, I just can’t believe that—people don’t act like that,” Henderson says. “I remember saying, ‘I grew up hearing my father and my uncles tell those stories.’ That’s when I realized the difference: my life experience. I understand those locker rooms. I have family who suffered those experiences... You can only bring to the bench what you have, what you’ve grown up with, and it affects you profoundly.”</p>

<p>In 1990, Henderson became the chief federal judge in San Francisco. He noticed a sudden spike in complaints from Pelican Bay. The complaints, handwritten by inmates, portrayed hellish conditions: Prisoners were caged outdoors wearing only underwear. One mentally ill prisoner suffered third-degree burns after guards forced him into a bathtub of boiling water. Henderson invited the prison’s warden to meet with senior judges to find out more. Henderson was appalled to learn the warden thought the conditions were acceptable.</p>

<p>A group of Pelican Bay prisoners brought suit. Prison officials denied that they mistreated any prisoners. Instead, they argued that the prison operated exactly as planned, isolating the most brutal, disruptive prisoners from the rest of California’s prisons. The case went to trial, and Henderson ordered an expert, called a special master, to oversee the prison.</p>

<p>Henderson kept a close eye on the prison. When he began his visits, he stayed in a small town near the prison. He quickly realized that hotel staff were alerting the prison that he was in town. He began staying about two hours south, so he could show up at the prison unannounced.</p>

<p>“I think I see my job as a judge as something beyond what a lot of judges do,” he said. “I see my duty as a judge, when I find that people are dying unnecessarily because of violations, I don’t think my job stops at writing an order. I feel I need to do something to stop it. And that’s really the dividing line.”</p>

<p>It was sixteen years before the judge turned control of Pelican Bay back to the state. By then, he was deeply entangled in another prisons case. This case, also a class action, claimed that the state’s medical system was so broken that inmates were dying. The prisons were so overcrowded, the prisoners claimed, that the state couldn’t provide basic care.</p>

<p>The ailments were mostly routine, a litany of bad knees and aching hips. But the conditions were shocking. Fifty sick inmates held together for hours in small cages awaiting treatment. Fifty-four inmates sharing a single toilet. Waiting lists for mental health treatment were years-long. The suicide rate was twice the national average for prisoners. Suicidal inmates were kept in “dry cages,” telephone-booth-sized contraptions without toilets.</p>

<p>At San Quentin State Prison, just outside San Francisco, Henderson walked into a gymnasium and saw hundreds of men crammed together in bunk beds. The bunks were so close that inmates had to turn sideways to squeeze into their beds.</p>

<p>“That’s what the overcrowding was—and that was hugely compelling,” Henderson says. “If it was a summer camp, you’d say that’s really crowded, but it’s not dangerous. It’s a very dangerous thing.”</p>

<p>Wendy Still, a former high-level administrator in California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, went with Henderson on one of his trips to San Quentin. When she saw the grim conditions and the judge’s shocked reaction, “there was no doubt in my mind as I drove away from the prison that the system was going into receivership.”</p>

<p>The governor at the time, Arnold Schwarzenegger, had declared the overcrowding a statewide emergency. Henderson began to hold regular meetings with all major players in the system. He didn’t expect the ills of the system to be cured overnight.</p>

<p>“I think the thing you have to understand is that people on the front line don’t like to be told to change,” Henderson said. “They resist things.”</p>

<p>He described his method as the catalyst approach, after an academic theory developed by a Columbia University professor on the way courts could be used to change bureaucratic systems. It was similar to the approach he’d tried with Pelican Bay—encourage everyone involved to buy into a solution, and long-term change will happen.</p>

<p>But when he saw how slowly change happened—and how many people were dying—he felt he had no choice but to take over all 33 prisons. No judge in the country had done anything on that scale.</p>

<p>“Appointing a receiver pushed my powers to the very, very limit,” the judge recalled. “I can’t think of a thing I could have done beyond that. I think it pushed them because it was unprecedented. There was nothing out there that says here’s how you take over a state medical system.”</p>

<p>The prisoners’ lawyers argued that change couldn’t happen until overcrowding was fixed. Henderson and two other judges formed a three-judge panel to oversee the prison system. They ordered the state to reduce its prison population, which at the time of the lawsuit was an astounding 181 percent of capacity, to 137.5 percent.</p>

<p>By then, the governor was Jerry Brown. In a meeting with Henderson, Brown worried that releasing prisoners could lead to a rise in crime.</p>

<p>“You’re letting Willie Hortons out on the street, that’s what you’re doing with this decision,” the judge said Brown told him. Horton, a convicted murderer who fled while on a prison furlough and terrorized a couple in their home, became an advertisement for tough-on-crime politics in the 1980’s.</p>

<p>Henderson was surprised because of Brown’s reputation as a progressive leader.</p>

<p>“He has these little things that no one can account for,” the judge said. “That’s just Jerry, they’ll say. And this is one. Something about the prisons. You know, I would have expected him to jump on this and want to clean it up. He said, ‘You can’t do it. You’re exceeding your powers. You can’t do it.’”</p>

<p>The state fought the case all the way to the Supreme Court, where a 5-4 majority led by Justice Anthony Kennedy found that Henderson and the other judges were within their powers to force the state to cut its prison population. In an unusual move, the justices appended photos of the suicide cages and gyms full of bunk beds to the decision.</p>

<p>The governor was forced to reckon with the overcrowding, and eventually became a champion of criminal justice experiments that went far beyond the court’s order. He supported realignment, a plan to shift thousands of people from state prisons to county jails. He then helped push Proposition 47, a ballot measure that reclassified a number of nonviolent crimes as misdemeanors that no longer carried a state prison sentence. And he was a strong advocate for Proposition 57, which changed the state’s parole system to offer earlier releases.</p>

<p>Henderson contends there are still improvements to be made. He advocates a parole board of people from various backgrounds, not just law enforcement. He wants better conditions in county jails that now house former state prisoners.</p>

<p>But a backlash is building, sparked by fears that the changes have led to an increase in crime. Whether crime is rising significantly, and whether the drop in the prison population is to blame —the data offers no clear answers to either question. But the battle for public perception is already fierce.</p>

<p>A coalition led by law enforcement officers and prosecutors is gathering signatures now to get a measure on the November ballot. The measure, called the Reducing Crime and Keeping California Safe Act of 2018, would redefine more than a dozen crimes, making those convicted ineligible for early release. It would also classify serial theft as a felony and mandate parole revocation for parolees who have three violations.</p>

<p>He said that opponents of the ballot measure should focus on the expense of incarceration, which he equates to “sending your kid to Stanford.” (It costs about $71,000 a year to incarcerate an inmate in California. A year at Stanford costs about $71,500 a year.)</p>

<p>Overall, though, he said the state is moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>“At this point, the arc of criminal justice is bent toward better conditions in our prisons—more humane sentences, more realistic treatment of people in our state prison system,” he said. “You can quote me as being optimistic in the long run.”</p>

<p>The judge feels he has won some tangible victories. San Quentin now has a gleaming modern medical facility. He went to the opening ceremony. A prisoner approached him.</p>

<p>“He came up to me and said, ‘I hear you grew up on 43rd and San Pedro,” the judge says.</p>

<p>The judge was wary.</p>

<p>“And I said, ‘How did you know that?’” the judge said.</p>

<p>The inmate, an editor at the prison newspaper, said that he’d grown up in Los Angeles, too, on 45th Street. He started talking about a corner store.</p>

<p>“And he described it and the store, and I realized we grew up two blocks away from each other,” the judge says. “We talked about it, and he’s a very smart guy, and I realized that, here I’m a federal judge for lucky circumstances in my life, and he’s in prison.”</p>

<p>The judge visited San Quentin one last time, in 2015, to give a talk in the prison chapel. As he entered the room, the prisoners rose to their feet and cheered.</p>

<h2 id="thejailhousesnitchaquiz">The Jailhouse Snitch: A Quiz</h2>

<p>by: Beth Schwartzapfel</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-22</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/04/23/the-jailhouse-snitch-a-quiz </p>

<p>This month, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the Orange County, California, district attorney and sheriff, the latest development in the county’s ongoing “snitch scandal.” For at least a decade, as part of a large-scale, meticulously organized program, deputies would plant informants to secretly gather incriminating information about defendants in the jail. When the snitches testified against those defendants, they didn’t reveal that law enforcement had orchestrated the encounters.</p>

<p>Prosecutors commonly use informants to secure convictions, swapping leniency for “substantial assistance.” Insiders with information to barter can be particularly crucial in cases of organized crime or sophisticated drug operations. (It wasn’t until Sammy ‘The Bull’ Gravano snitched that the feds finally nabbed John Gotti, for example.) It is common for prosecutors to bring the toughest possible charges against a potential informant as a lever to get cooperation.</p>

<p>But snitches who gather intelligence on jailhouse neighbors — often complete strangers — should be treated with particular skepticism, courts have said: they have “a tremendous incentive” to say whatever prosecutors want to hear, says Boston College Law Professor Robert Bloom, author of “Ratting: The Use and Abuse of Informants in the American Justice System.”</p>

<p>Below, test your knowledge of how jailhouse snitching works — and doesn’t work — around the country.</p>

<p>$335,000</p>

<p>Unlimited Taco Bell runs</p>

<p>All of the above</p>

<p>The most common incentive offered to jailhouse snitches for information or testimony is years lopped off a potential sentence. Federal defendants who cooperate with prosecutors during the course of their cases have their prison time reduced, on average, by more than half, according to a 2016 U.S. Sentencing Commission report. But that is not the only incentive to inform, or misinform. In 1990s Detroit, detainees in the police department’s holding cells got hot food, drugs, and rooms to entertain visitors in exchange for studying other defendants’ court papers so they could give testimony that matched prosecutors’ version of events, according to two news investigations. Among the Orange County Sheriff’s Department’s most prolific snitches was a pair of Mexican Mafia members who were rewarded with sofas in their cells, cartons of cigarettes, “almost limitless Taco Bell runs,” and a total of $335,000 for their work on dozens of cases, according to local news reports. If these sound uncomfortably like bribes, says Alexandra Natapoff, UC-Irvine law professor and author of “Snitching: Criminal Informants and the Erosion of American Justice,” that’s because they are. “Bribing a witness is illegal. Every single one of these cases is, in effect, bribing a witness. But courts have said it doesn’t count if it’s the government doing it.”</p>

<p>If a witness has been given a lighter sentence or other incentives in exchange for testimony, prosecutors are supposed to tell defense attorneys about it. Which of the following is an exception to this rule?</p>

<p>All of the above</p>

<p>Information that undermines a witness’s credibility must be turned over, but courts have split on when. In some states prosecutors can withhold this information until trial — and since more than 90 percent of convictions are the result of plea bargains, not trials, in many cases the information is never turned over. Also, prosecutors can telegraph a reward — wink wink — without actually promising anything in advance. “When this person takes the stand, and he or she is asked, ‘has the government given you any promises in exchange for your testimony,’ they say ‘no.’ And that’s true,” says Boston College’s Robert Bloom. “Because they deliberately don’t give promises until after the testimony.”</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has put some limits on the behavior of jailhouse informants. They are not allowed to...</p>

<p>All of the above</p>

<p>The Supreme Court has forbidden police from directing a snitch to question a particular person; that makes the snitch an agent of the government, and during a government interrogation the accused is entitled to a lawyer. But if the cops ask a snitch to just sit and listen — or if the snitch happens to gather information about someone without having been given instructions — that’s fair game. The high court also forbid snitches from threatening violence to obtain information — a ploy that the ACLU suit alleges that Orange County snitches used regularly.</p>

<p>A handful of states use “pretrial reliability hearings,” in which a judge decides whether an informant’s testimony is credible enough for the jury to hear it. Why do these states give the judge this “gatekeeper” function?</p>

<p>Because getting detainees from the jail to the courthouse is so logistically complicated that courts don’t do it unless they absolutely must</p>

<p>All of the above</p>

<p>Even when snitches reveal a quid pro quo on the stand, research shows this information does little to undermine the jury’s faith in their testimony. In one study, which asked participants to imagine they were on the jury in hypothetical cases, even perjured testimony doubled the chances that jurors would convict. “This is a recipe for false convictions,” the authors wrote.</p>

<p>How many people have been exonerated after they were wrongly convicted based on the testimony of a jailhouse informant?</p>

<p>0</p>

<p>25</p>

<p>150</p>

<p>3,000</p>

<p>The National Registry of Exonerations lists 150 people who were wrongfully convicted based (at least in part) on the testimony of a jailhouse informant. Of these, more than 40 percent were life sentences and 18 percent were death sentences. It is unclear how many people convicted based on informant testimony have been executed. Here is The Marshall Project’s story of Cameron Todd Willingham, executed in 2004, who was convicted based in part on the testimony of a jailhouse snitch who later recanted.</p>

<p>It’s not just police and prosecutors who pay for information. Inmates also act as brokers, selling information to other inmates, who offer it to law enforcement in exchange for more lenient sentences. What’s the most an inmate was paid in this prisoner-to-prisoner market, according to a 2012 USA Today investigation?</p>

<p>$1 million</p>

<p>$250,000</p>

<p>$10,000</p>

<p>Ramen noodles</p>

<p>Because sentencing guidelines set strict parameters for the sentence a federal judge can hand down, the only way to reduce the length of sentence is by providing the government “substantial assistance” — information. "People are willing to pay $20,000 or $30,000 to get a piece of information. That tells you how valuable it is," a former federal public defender told USA Today. (Ramen noodles are often used as a form of currency in prison, but we have not seen a documented case of a snitch using them to pay for information.)</p>

<p>Before the Orange County scandal, there was Leslie Vernon White, a prolific Los Angeles snitcher who later not only admitted he had lied about hearing jailmates confess, but demonstrated on television how he gathered information that seemed credible. How did White do it?</p>

<p>He identified vulnerable young people in jail and gained their trust, pretending to lend a sympathetic ear while they discussed their cases.</p>

<p>He made a series of phone calls posing as a bail bondsman, a police sergeant, and a deputy district attorney</p>

<p>All of the above</p>

<p>In a scheme almost too brazen to be believed, White would call various law enforcement officials, posing as a law enforcement official himself, and ask for details about a crime. He would leverage those details to gather other details, until he had a story only an “insider” would know. In 1989, the New York Times reported White had testified or offered to testify in at least a dozen cases in exchange for a parole recommendation, furloughs, and cash. Other tactics have also been used. Bruce Lisker was 17, in the Los Angeles County Jail facing charges for murdering his mother, when another inmate offered to pray with him and discuss his case; the man later testified that Lisker had confessed to him; he bolstered his credibility with details he had read in Lisker’s papers. Lisker was exonerated in 2009 after 26 years in prison.</p>

<h2 id="documentingthehardtruthsofprisonandpolicing">Documenting the Hard Truths of Prison and Policing</h2>

<p>by: Celina Fang</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-24</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/04/25/documenting-the-hard-truths-of-prison-and-policing </p>

<p>At Tribeca Film Festival, new documentaries give voice to the incarcerated and communities struggling with crime. </p>

<p>Two documentaries premiering at this week’s Tribeca Film Festival in New York—Madeleine Sackler’s “It’s a Hard Truth Ain’t It” and Marilyn Ness’s “Charm City”—address issues of criminal justice, but they do so in vastly different ways.</p>

<p>In Sackler’s film, 13 Indiana prison inmates, many of whom have been convicted of murder or attempted murder, are given cameras to record each other’s reflections. In “Charm City,” Ness takes a more traditional documentary approach as she explores tensions between the Baltimore Police Department and the communities it serves.</p>

<p>In “It’s a Hard Truth Ain’t It,” Rushawn Tanksley is asked by a fellow prisoner at Pendleton Correctional Facility what title he would give the story of his life up to that point. Rushawn, who is serving a sentence for murder and aggravated battery, says he would call it “What If.” As in, what if he hadn’t grown up in Memphis? What if he hadn’t started selling dope? Would he still be on the streets, or would he be dead? By asking them to interview each other, the director gives the men, who have been stripped of the ability to make decisions about their lives, the power to tell their own stories.</p>

<p>She also gives the men the rare opportunity to control images of themselves, and of each other. Typically, prison officials control photographs of inmates, from mugshots, which many consider stigmatizing, to visiting room portraits, which are usually taken in front of the same institutional backdrop and show few traces of a prisoner’s personality.</p>

<p>To make her film, Sackler requested access to inmates at 15 different prisons; only Pendleton Correctional Facility agreed to allow her to equip the inmates with video cameras. She also convinced the prison administration to let her teach an intensive filmmaking workshop on shooting, incorporating music, and editing. To help the prisoners understand her line of work, she screened multiple documentaries for them, including “Murderball” and “Grizzly Man.”</p>

<p>In addition to featuring the interviews that the men conduct with each other, “It’s a Hard Truth Ain’t It” is a meta-documentary that shows how the men determined the structure of the film. In one scene, the inmates discuss how they want to be portrayed.</p>

<p>“I don’t want us to get into making this feel like a sympathy type of thing, because I don’t want the kid seeing because oh, this guy made a mistake, he was abused, he was on drugs, his father went there. Let’s also tell the other story of, I chose to kill you,” says Charles Lawrence, one of the inmates.</p>

<p>Sackler made the film in part because she felt the the country is at a crossroads on the issue of criminal justice. “Will we continue down this path of retribution and punishment, or will we reorient ourselves and start down a path of care and compassion?” she said in an interview. “I strongly believe that deeply understanding the drivers behind violence is the only way to start preventing it in the future.”</p>

<p>“Charm City” is a documentary about three years of escalating violence in Baltimore, which hit a record for homicides per capita in 2017. Marilyn Ness, the director, and Kate Chevigny, the producer, sought to better understand the divide between the police and citizens in the period after Freddie Gray’s death in police custody rattled the city in 2015. (Marshall Project reporter Justin George participated in the making of the film.)</p>

<p>Lack of trust in the police leads the residents of Rose Street, a community in Baltimore’s Eastern District, to take peacekeeping into their own hands. Led by Clayton “Mr. C” Guyton, members of the community work as violence interrupters, de-escalating incidents on the streets. Alex Long, one of Mr. C’s many “sons,” not by birth but by choosing, helps not only with gang mediation but also with planning activities such as trash collection for younger kids.</p>

<p>While Ness does not vilify the police, she believes that officers must do more to cultivate trust. “When people can’t or won’t call the police in times of crisis, street justice will fill that vacuum, and everyone becomes less safe,” she said.</p>

<p>In 2017, the Justice Department reached an agreement on a consent decree to address systemic problems in the Baltimore Police Department. It called for the creation of a community oversight task force; using tactics that defuse incidents and minimize the need to resort to force; and an improvement in responses to individuals with behavioral health disabilities.</p>

<p>Ness hopes that people watching “Charm City” realize that the criminal justice system isn’t working for anyone. “It’s certainly not working for poor communities of color in Baltimore, and, it turns out, it’s not working for the police either,” she said. “Everyone is exhausted. Everyone is living with unreasonable and unsustainable amounts of trauma and grief. If we really and meaningfully want to change the system, then we need to change it for everyone caught up in it.”</p>

<p>What does it mean to “change a narrative?” Bryan Stevenson has been insisting on the importance of changing the narrative on criminal justice since he published his best-selling book, “Just Mercy”, in 2014. He’s a death penalty lawyer who likes to say, “We have a system of justice that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.”</p>

<p>The notion that locking up more bad guys makes us safer is hard to shake. Law-and-order rhetoric has a new friend in the White House, with an attorney general who wants to double down on harsh sentences. And Stevenson, with the opening of a new museum and lynching memorial that I attended in Montgomery, Alabama, last week, has chosen a more revolutionary approach to fixing criminal justice than the skilful lawyering for which he’s well known. He is rewriting the history of the civil rights movement.</p>

<p>To those who follow criminal justice, Stevenson’s new narrative may not sound so new. Lawyer Michelle Alexander argued in her influential 2010 book, “The New Jim Crow”, that white supremacy was never fully vanquished, as slavery gave rise to the horrors of the Jim Crow south. Virulent racism survived the civil rights movement, too, as Jim Crow morphed into a criminal justice system that continues to lock up African-Americans disproportionately. Millions have read Alexander’s book, or seen the video version of it in Ava Duvernay’s 2016 documentary, “13th”.</p>

<p>Stevenson is also trying to spread this narrative beyond the criminal justice cognoscenti. His TED talk has been viewed nearly 5 million times, and he has indefatigably toured college campuses and corporate headquarters in recent years, making the case for mercy. Stevenson, who sits on the advisory board of The Marshall Project, once told me that he turns down the majority of the media requests that come his way. Instead, delivering a stump speech that verges on sermon, he seems to be trying to change America one auditorium at a time.</p>

<p>Montgomery now has a bricks-and-mortar version of this narrative. The new lynching memorial in Montgomery sets out the scope of the crime: more than 4,400 African-Americans were killed by mobs between 1877-1950. But it’s the Legacy Museum that brings the civil rights story right into today’s headlines. Exhibits greet the visitor with huge ribbons of text such as “Slavery was justified with false notions of black inferiority,” and proceed through Jim Crow, the civil rights movement, and into the criminal justice system. Almost literally: the visitor can sit in phone booths that mimic the experience of a video visitation with someone in prison. The message is clear. The civil rights movement isn’t over.</p>

<p>Life Inside </p>

<p>Stevenson has decried the “three-day carnival” story of civil rights: Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat; Martin Luther King, Jr led some awesome marches; and then the laws changed. That narrative is common in civil rights museums around the country, and they have been proliferating. Atlanta, Birmingham, and Greensboro, North Carolina all have such museums; one opened in Mississippi last year, and another is due in Charleston in 2020.</p>

<p>Will this new museum change the civil rights narrative in the very institutions that have been established to guard it? Maybe. My kids and I visited the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis one August when the air outside was hot and sticky. The museum inside was chilly as an icebox, and the exhibits presented a narrative that seemed frozen, too: a stirring account of marches, protests, and events long past. We looked, we shivered, and we left.</p>

<p>On the way out of town, in a post office in an African-American neighborhood, we got chatting with the clerk. He pointed out Memphis’ main city park was named for Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early member of the Ku Klux Klan, and suddenly the civil rights narrative melted right into the present day.</p>

<p>That park was renamed in 2013, though, and the statue of Forrest was removed in December. Narratives have a way of zigging and zagging. The Montgomery Advertiser ran a mea culpa editorial last week with the opening words, “We were wrong.” It went on to recount the details of local lynchings and acknowledge the paper’s own shameful coverage of them, saying “We take responsibility for our proliferation of a false narrative regarding the treatment of African-Americans in those disgraceful days.” What about these days? The lock-em-up narrative still exerts a heavy pull on the national imagination. It’ll be interesting to see how the Montgomery Advertiser now covers the criminal justice system in Alabama, and beyond.</p>

<h2 id="istheresuchathingasaslamdunk">Is There Such a Thing as a Slam Dunk?</h2>

<p>by: Andrew Cohen</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-15</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/04/16/is-there-such-a-thing-as-a-slam-dunk </p>

<p>Corey Williams was not your average 16-year-old boy growing up in Shreveport, Louisiana, in the 1990s. He drooled. He frequently urinated on himself and could not always manage to use the toilet properly. He sucked his thumb. He was unable to function properly at school, when he even made it to class, and was considered “mentally retarded,” as officials then phrased it. He “regularly ate dirt, paper, [and] lead paint chips,” an expert concluded years later in what she called “the most extreme case of lead poisoning that I have ever seen.” Williams’ IQ around this age was 65, marking him as “intellectually disabled” under the test the U.S. Supreme Court has long used.</p>

<p>Williams’ disability made him a target of cruelty and manipulation by some of the people in his life. Boys his age teased him. His classmates were mean to him. And so were many of the adults in his life. In January 1998, just three weeks after his 16th birthday, Williams found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time. He was standing in front of a house with a group of older men one evening when someone shot and killed a pizza delivery man who had driven to the house to complete an order. After the murder, Williams ran to his grandmother’s house and was found hiding under a sheet on the couch.</p>

<p>Williams first told the police that the older men had committed the murder. He also told them that those other men had told him, Williams, that they would kill him if he told the cops the truth about what had happened to the delivery man. But the police didn’t take yes for an answer. By the next morning, after a night of police interrogation with no attorney present, the boy with the 65 IQ had changed his tune. He told the cops that he had shot the victim. But even then the story he told was inconsistent with many of the details about the crime the police had uncovered. When Williams was done “confessing,” he told the officers: “I’m tired. I’m ready to go home and lay down.”</p>

<p>That was 20 years ago. Williams was convicted of murder and sentenced to death following a trial orchestrated by Hugo Holland, one of the state’s most notorious prosecutors. We’ve learned since then not just the extent of Williams’ disability but also how prosecutors manipulated the truth to convict him. Williams is no longer eligible for the death penalty-- both his age at the time of the crime and his mental condition preclude that-- but his case now is before the U.S. Supreme Court and it presents one of those rare instances where the injustice is so evident the justices may reverse Williams’ conviction outright without an oral argument.</p>

<p>n the murder investigation and prosecution that took place in Caddo Parish in 1998, nothing was as it seemed to be. There was no physical evidence linking Williams to the murder and there was no motive, either. Key witnesses interviewed by the cops in the wake of the crime all exonerated Williams and implicated three of the older men who were at that house when Jarvis Griffin, the victim, drove up to deliver his pizzas. But none of those men were ever charged with capital murder and only one of them has ever served time for the crime.</p>

<p>Griffin’s blood was found on the sweatshirt of a man named Gabriel Logan, and Griffin’s undelivered pizza boxes, and money, were found near Gabriel Logan’s home. The murder weapon was found near there as well. Witnesses initially told the police that Logan had robbed Griffin and that he, his brother Nathan Logan, and a man named Chris “Rapist” Moore had split the pizza money and hidden the .25 caliber gun used to kill Griffin. Nathan Logan, whose fingerprints were found on the murder weapon, told the police that he believed his own brother, Gabriel, had committed the murder and that Moore had set the whole thing up. None of these men ever faced the death sentence that eventually was handed down to Williams.</p>

<p>Many of these same witnesses at the same time gave statements that exonerated Williams. Nathan Logan, who incriminated his own brother, told the police that Williams could not have been the shooter. Another witness told police that he had seen Nathan Logan that evening give Moore the gun that ultimately was used to kill Griffin. Williams was nowhere to be seen when this happened. Police investigators even went on record as saying they believed the older men had committed the murder and that Williams was innocent. Other witnesses told the cops what Williams initially had told them: that Moore and the Logans had threatened them to change their stories.</p>

<p>Only Moore undermined the narrative. Facing a potential murder rap, with all the allegations against him, he chose to blame Williams for the robbery and murder and, inexplicably, police and prosecutors chose to believe him and ignore the rest of what they knew. They built their case at trial entirely on Moore’s testimony and Williams’ “confession” (which today would never withstand judicial review given what we know about the links between teenagers, intellectual disabilities, and false confessions). We may never know why Louisiana officials made this choice. And we’ll never know what jurors would have done had they been told the truth about Moore and the Logans.</p>

<p>Case in Point </p>

<p>hich brings us to the issue that is central to Williams’ pending petition to have the case reviewed by the high court. Before Williams’ trial his attorneys asked prosecutors for recordIngs of police interviews of the witnesses. It was a standard request and prosecutors had an obligation to respond to it under the principle set forth by the Supreme Court 55 years ago in a case styled Brady v. Maryland. But Caddo Parish prosecutors refused to do so. Instead, they gave the defense team “summaries” of the interviews. That’s standard practice in the state. The summaries Williams’ attorneys received from Caddo Parish prosecutors were misleading. They falsely incriminated Williams and exonerated Moore and the Logans.</p>

<p>Whereas Nathan Logan, for example, had told the police that his brother Gabriel “had to do it” and that Moore had “set it up,” the defense prior to trial was given a summary by prosecutors that indicated that Nathan Logan had told the police that Williams had committed the murder. Missing entirely from the documents given to Williams’ lawyers were the statements witnesses made to the police about the pressure Moore and the Logans had put on witnesses to perjure themselves. And to add insult to injury, at trial the prosecutor, knowing what he was hiding from Williams’ lawyers, mocked in closing arguments the defense theory that Moore and the Logans were the culprits.</p>

<p>He told told jurors:</p>

<p>… frankly, if you want to get down to it, what you have to believe to buy into this theory that Nathan and Gabriel and Chris framed Corey Williams, and let’s face it, Nathan and Chris didn’t sound too smart, has to be the biggest conspiracy or the biggest set of coincidental circumstances to bring an unfortunate man to trial, the biggest set of circumstances concerning a conspiracy since John Kennedy was killed in 1963...</p>

<p>Prosecutors justified their decision to provide these dubious summaries, and not the actual recordings or texts of the interviews, by claiming that the statements were not “material” to Williams’ defense. They based that argument on the fact that Williams had “confessed” to the crime and that his confession was so significant none of the rest of the evidence would have mattered. Prosecutors made this argument, and the courts of Louisiana accepted it, for years after Williams’ intellectual disability was proven in court in 2004. In other words, these judges used a “confession” made by an intellectually disabled 16-year-old to justify the decision by trial prosecutors to keep relevant evidence from defense attorneys and jurors.</p>

<p>The Williams case thus presents to the justices what likely will be an irresistible constellation of issues. You have the question of prosecutorial misconduct merged with the issue of a police interrogation of an intellectually disabled teenager. Which means you have the issue of a potentially false confession. You also have the question of the misapplication of the “Brady Rule” of pretrial discovery merged with Louisiana’s dubious reliance on malleable “summaries” of testimony. And you have it all taking place in Caddo Parish, during the reign of Hugo Holland, a prosecutor known for taking shortcuts in pursuing the death penalty.</p>

<p>Little wonder, then, that 44 former prosecutors and Justice Department officials, including many conservative experts, weighed in earlier this month on Williams’ behalf. Little wonder that Louisiana officials haven’t bothered yet to respond to the petition Williams’ lawyers have filed. Little wonder that Williams’ attorneys say their client’s time in prison has been a particularly miserable experience, a time where other inmates, and sometimes guards, continue to prey on him. And it would be no surprise if the justices decide to put an end to his misery sooner rather than later.</p>

<h2 id="whythisjudgedreadsexecutionday">Why This Judge Dreads Execution Day</h2>

<p>by: Mike Lynch</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-11</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/04/12/why-this-judge-dreads-execution-day </p>

<p>“I wondered whether the system I have been a part of for so long was, simply, barbaric.” </p>

<p>The execution was set for 6 p.m. I knew because I set the date and time myself.</p>

<p>With a little more than an hour to go, I sat alone by the phone in my office. More than three decades had passed since the defendant was first convicted of murdering a police officer. I had been the judge at his final trial, and now there was a chance I’d be called on to spare his life.</p>

<p>Higher courts and the Texas governor had already denied the man’s last-ditch appeals. His lawyers had tried to broker a deal with prosecutors to keep him alive, but that had failed, too. Now he was down to his last shot: The defense could present some new argument or evidence to convince me to intervene and stop the execution. If they did, I would have to make a life-or-death decision with essentially no time for research or discussion.</p>

<p>I waited. As the minutes passed, I felt a familiar sense of unease. In the years since I’d presided over his trial, the defendant had become a gray-haired, middle-aged man. He had put together a nearly flawless record helping other inmates. It was hard to see how he still constituted a violent threat to society, a requirement for death penalty cases in Texas. Now, barring a final legal maneuver, he would be erased from the Earth by a system in which I was a key participant.</p>

<p>I stared out the window, feeling jealous of folks headed home or to a happy hour. Eventually, the clock ticked to 6 pm. My phone never rang. I turned on the TV, and learned from the evening news that the execution had proceeded as planned.</p>

<p>As I left the office, I fell into a dark funk. Usually, I was proud and confident about my work as a judge, but a terrible feeling settled over me—the same feeling I had each time I was involved in a death penalty case. Sometimes I was able to rationalize that my role in the outcome of these cases was minimal. After all, jurors were the ones who weighed evidence and reached a lawful verdict. But other times I wondered whether the system I have been a part of for so long was, simply, barbaric.</p>

<p>I ran for office and took the oath knowing that the death penalty would be part of my job, whether I liked it or not. Each time I encountered a capital case—eight came before me during my two decades on the bench—there would be at least one moment that brought my internal conflict starkly into focus. These moments are painfully fresh in my mind.</p>

<p>In my first death penalty trial, in 1998, the defendant had sexually assaulted and brutally slashed and stabbed a woman who had befriended him. The jury found him guilty of capital murder, but it was my duty to formally pronounce his sentence in open court. He displayed no emotion—during the trial, he’d only seemed interested in the crime scene and autopsy photos—and there was evidence he was a psychopath, that he felt no remorse. Still, after announcing his sentence, I felt an urgent need to drink and gulped two huge glasses of water.</p>

<p>I wondered: Is my throat dry, or am I trying to wash the words out of my mouth?</p>

<p>Become a Member </p>

<p>Years later, I had to sign the order setting a time for this man’s death—“by intravenous injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death and until such convict is dead”—and I remember staring at the paper, feeling strange and unnerved. Later, in my journal, I wrote about how I felt I was “invading God’s province.” I heard about another judge who placed a smiley face next to his signature on a death warrant. I couldn’t comprehend that attitude.</p>

<p>Writing in my journal helped me stay balanced and objective. Once, I wrote about a defendant who was facing the death penalty, “He was almost always seated with his head tilted slightly downward and his eyes staring downward into space.” During the trial, he had showed little emotion. But when it was time for me to say the required words pronouncing his death sentence, I looked him in the eye. As I wrote later, “I was struck by a sight I will never forget. He looked so small, helpless, pathetic. His eyes looked like those of the proverbial deer in the headlights. He had been convicted of being a brutal, sadistic killer, and it was hard to argue that he was not getting what he deserved—but at that moment, for an instant, I saw the other side of the man, the side his family loved.”</p>

<p>I continued: “If only we could execute the bad side and keep the good side alive.”</p>

<p>On another occasion, as an execution was approaching, I was visited by the defendant’s lawyers. The appeals had been exhausted; there was nothing they could do. They suggested we get together on the night of the execution. At first, I thought the idea was sick, demented, heartless—a social hour during an execution! But I knew these lawyers; they were compassionate, serious. We kept talking about the idea, and I realized they were dreading the execution as much as I was. They thought sharing the moment would make things a little less difficult. I joined them, and it was a therapeutic, somber evening. Far better than sitting alone in my office.</p>

<p>For some time, I had been thinking about retiring, but it was a moment of pronouncing a death sentence—and thinking “no more of these”—that finally made me decide to leave the bench, six years ago. Since then, I have felt a deep satisfaction and pride about my career, despite those terrible, uncomfortable moments.</p>

<p>I suppose they were the price I had to pay.</p>

<h2 id="policebrutalitydroveawedgebetweenmeandmychurch">Police Brutality Drove a Wedge Between Me and My Church</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-04-10</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/04/11/police-brutality-drove-a-wedge-between-me-and-my-church </p>

<p>Martin Luther King, Jr. once famously said that 11 a.m. on Sunday morning is one of the most segregated hours in American life. Despite that sad historical truth, studies have shown movement, albeit slow, toward the integration of congregations. That progress is in danger of being reversed, however, with black worshippers leaving their mostly white churches in droves in recent years. We’re being pushed out by a failure of our churches to apply their professed values to racial injustice and, as I experienced, to the issue of police brutality.</p>

<p>I joined my church in 2005 when I was just 17 years old, having been invited by a family friend. Despite few of the members of the congregation being black, the messages I heard there resonated. Further, as I would tell new members when I led church orientation years later, I joined because of the love and warmth I felt from the people. To this day, I still believe that the congregation has some of the nicest people I’ve ever met. Unfortunately, there were limits to that warmth that I could not abide.</p>

<p>In my 11 years as a very active member of the church, I had known that my pastor and a good number of the members were politically conservative, but it never bothered me much. I believed that our shared faith superseded any racial, social or cultural divisions. There was no room for strife in Christ, I thought. Then Philando Castile was murdered.</p>

<p>Castile was shot and killed by a police officer in St. Paul, Minn., in July of 2016. Upon learning the circumstances of his life and death, I was floored. Castile was employed as a school cafeteria worker and took pride in his job. He knew each one of the children he served lunch by name. He would pay for the lunches of students who couldn’t afford them and was considered a role model by his co-workers.</p>

<p>The officer who killed Castile, Jeronimo Yanez, shot him to death in the passenger seat of his car after being informed by Castile that he was carrying a firearm for which he had a permit. According to reports, Yanez panicked and fired at Castile as he reached for his license and registration, not the firearm. “I wasn’t reaching for it,” was reportedly the last thing Castile said as he died and his girlfriend and her 4-year-old daughter screamed in horror. There’s no way anyone could deny that was wrong, I thought.</p>

<p>But deny it they did. I was mortified as I watched conservative pundits, politicians, and people I know wave away the circumstances and blame Castile for his own death. Ultimately, the response I heard from my then-pastor was the most disturbing.</p>

<p>In the middle of a Sunday sermon, without referencing the case directly, he spoke of a traffic stop he had some time before. In his story, he said that he informed the officer that he had his license and registration in a bag on his passenger seat after being asked for it. The officer asked him to reach for the license slowly and he did as he was asked. The rest of the encounter proceeded smoothly, he said, adding flatly at the end of the story, “And I didn’t get shot.”</p>

<p>It was like a punch in the gut.</p>

<p>Life Inside </p>

<p>I grew up in Ferguson, Mo., and my experience there as a black man provided an understanding of the tense relationship between black people and the police. I’ve had first-hand experience of being unjustly targeted by law enforcement—stopped by police on the suspicion of burglary as I helped my sister move, ticketed excessively for driving while black (I personally paid more than $1,300 in traffic fines while I attended my former church.)</p>

<p>Not long after the sermon, I decided to write a letter to my pastor. It explained, in part, what I felt was his inappropriate and divisive response to stories of police brutality from the pulpit. The letter was heart-wrenching to write, and I made several dozen revisions and consulted with others, including my parents, before sending it. He sent back a terse response: “Hey Anthony...I read your letter. Your ‘version’ of truth is not truth. Keep listening to CNN, and you'll be on the spiritual junk pile before long...and you won't even realize it...just like you don't realize you're off now.”</p>

<p>I struggled to continue on in the congregation despite being demoralized by the reply. It may sound strange, but I’d felt traumatized by Philando Castile's death. I’d expressed that to my pastor—a man I considered a spiritual adviser and friend—but instead of being met with compassion, there were only deflections and accusations.</p>

<p>In the end, I was unable to reconcile my pastor’s preaching of the Gospel with his views on racialized police brutality and I finally decided to leave the church early last year.</p>

<p>While there are probably some mostly white churches that get it right on issues of racial justice, studies show that the majority don’t. According to a survey by the Public Religion Research Institute, white evangelical Protestants stand out as the religious group most likely to say the criminal justice system treats people of color and whites equally with 57 percent endorsing that belief. More specifically, 62 percent say that police officers treat blacks the same as whites.</p>

<p>The distance between these beliefs and reality suggests that white Christians are failing to hear their brothers and sisters of color. And that failure raises serious concerns about the ability of mostly white congregations to advance the gospel of Jesus, a victim himself of state violence.</p>

<p>As police continue to shoot and kill black Americans at disproportionate rates and with little accountability, white Christians must learn that the unjust treatment of their black brothers and sisters is not something to be waved away. Instead, churches should facilitate healthy dialog within their walls with the goal of increasing understanding. After all, addressing prejudice, injustice and systemic inequality is not a distraction from the Gospel. On the contrary, it is the heart of it.</p>

<h2 id="sevenyearsbehindbarsfortwojointsandnowhesfree">Seven Years Behind Bars for Two Joints — And Now He’s Free</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-04-12</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/04/12/seven-years-behind-bars-for-two-joints-and-now-he-s-free </p>

<p>Bernard Noble, who became a national symbol of harsh drug laws after he was sentenced to 13 years of hard labor for carrying about two joints worth of marijuana, was released from prison early Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Noble, 51, was freed on parole after his lawyer and a team of advocates — including billionaire New York hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb — spent years pressing courts, governors and lawmakers to reverse the long sentence. He ultimately served seven years in prison.</p>

<p>“I really felt special, seeing my family and everyone waiting for me,” Noble told The Marshall Project by phone after he walked out of Bossier Parish Medium Security Prison, where his mother, sister, and other family members awaited his release.</p>

<p>“I cried a lot of times in prison silently because you can’t do it out loud in a treacherous place like that. But I always said, ‘one day it’s gonna get better,’ ” he said.</p>

<p>His freedom marked the end of a convoluted and high-profile legal journey that began in 2010, when he was arrested while biking in New Orleans, where he was visiting family. Police said they found about three grams of marijuana in his possession.</p>

<p>Noble was sentenced in 2011 under what were then some of the toughest drug laws and sentencing practices in the country. Because he had been convicted of having small amounts of cocaine and marijuana multiple times in the past, Noble was sentenced to 13 years of hard labor, without the possibility of parole, under Louisiana’s “habitual offender” law.</p>

<p>Amid growing unease over the nation’s high incarceration rate, the case became a rallying cry for revising tough drug laws dating to the 1980s and 90s. Noble’s sentence seemed especially unfair when other states were legalizing pot for medical and personal use.</p>

<p>“There is plenty of data and evidence that suggests harsh drug sentences are not effective, and we can argue those talking points until we are blue in the face, but most people need to see flesh and blood,” said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, an organization advocating for more lenient sentencing.</p>

<p>Media including Newsweek, VICE, and The Huffington Post (as well as marijuana-centric websites such as HERB and The Cannabist) wrote about his story. His mother, Elnora Noble, collected nearly 75,000 signatures on a Change.org petition for his clemency. People took to Twitter to call on then-President Barack Obama to issue a pardon, using the hashtag #freebernardnoble. (A federal pardon would not have helped, however, because the case was in state courts.)</p>

<p>After Noble was convicted, two separate district court judges attempted to reduce his sentence to five years, citing his lack of a violent record and the fact that he supported seven children. But Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro opposed the change and prevailed in state Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Noble languished behind bars.</p>

<p>The case eventually caught the attention of Loeb, a frequent donor to criminal justice reform efforts whose interest helped rally national advocates. (Full disclosure: The Margaret and Daniel Loeb — Third Point Foundation is a donor to The Marshall Project.)</p>

<p>In 2015, supporters petitioned then-Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, for clemency. But the state had a rule that a prisoner had to have served 10 years before clemency could be considered. Noble hadn’t reached that threshold, so his petition was denied.</p>

<p>Become a Member </p>

<p>When Democrat John Bel Edwards was elected governor in 2016, supporters raised the issue again, using Noble’s situation as a chance to challenge the state’s clemency law.</p>

<p>“But for Dan Loeb, we would not even have known, not just about Bernard’s case, but also this administrative rule on clemency,” said Holly Harris, executive director of the D.C.-based Justice Action Network.</p>

<p>Harris and her team lobbied Edwards to change the 10-year rule and consider a reprieve for Noble. Noble didn’t get his reprieve, but earlier this year, the parole board voted to remove the 10-year rule. The change is now waiting to be finalized.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in 2015, Louisiana lawmakers passed a bill to reduce the maximum sentence for marijuana possession, bringing the state’s laws more in line with the national average. On a fourth conviction, the maximum became eight years, down from 20. But the law did not apply retroactively.</p>

<p>Noble’s lawyer, Jee Park, senior attorney for public policy at the Innocence Project New Orleans, negotiated with the district attorney’s office. In December 2016, the office relented, and Noble was re-sentenced to eight years. Cannizzaro said in an emailed statement that he agreed to the reduction based on the state’s new sentencing guidelines. But he added that Noble had originally been offered a plea deal for a five-year sentence. “He declined, believing he would beat the case at trial,” Cannizzaro said. “He did not."</p>

<p>"We hope that Mr. Noble has been able to resolve his substance abuse issues and will lead a law-abiding life free of further involvement in the criminal justice system,” Cannizzaro added.</p>

<p>Noble applied for parole in June 2017, but his hearing was delayed while waiting for another legislative tweak that made non-violent “habitual offenders” eligible for release to go into effect. In December 2017, Noble again went before the parole board, but a technical glitch kept his lawyers from speaking on his behalf. Noble would have to wait two more months.</p>

<p>In February, the board granted Noble parole on the condition he move back to Missouri, where he was living at the time of his arrest. His lawyers protested, noting that his family, housing, and job were all in New Orleans. For two more months, Noble remained in prison while the parole board deliberated. Ultimately, Noble was allowed to stay in the state.</p>

<p>Now free, he is hoping to repay the support he received by helping young people stay out of trouble or joining an effort to raise the state’s minimum wage.</p>

<p>“I am ready to get to work,” he said. “I didn’t go through all of this just to come home, eat a hot plate of food, and work at McDonalds.”</p>

<p>and Josef Kirk Fischl was tucked away behind a 30-foot-high gray wall in C Block, one of Attica Correctional Facility's toughest cellblocks. He had already served more than 16 years on a 25-to-life bid for a murder he committed when he was 19.</p>

<p>At the time, Fischl was sporting dreadlocks down his back. One day, filing out to the yard, he walked through a gauntlet of corrections officers holding wooden batons, their arms sleeved in tattoos—skulls, dragons, spider webs wrapped around elbows. He was ordered to put his hands on the wall. It hadn’t taken long for the COs to home in on the white guy with dreads.</p>

<p>Once the corridor was cleared of other prisoners, an officer said to Fischl, "Cut those dreads. Take it back to your cell."</p>

<p>Josef Kirk Fischl says he was beaten by correctional officers and put in solitary confinement at Attica Correctional Facility for wearing dreads.</p>

<p>The next day, a different CO stopped Fischl on the way to the mess hall and told him that only Rastafari were allowed dreads and that he had to cut his. Fischl said no, according to the officer, who gave him a misbehavior ticket for refusing a direct order. By the time of the ensuing disciplinary hearing, Fischl had already written to the chaplain and changed his religion from Jehovah's Witness to Rasta. He was found guilty of the infraction but allowed to keep his dreadlocks.</p>

<p>Twelve days after the hearing, Fischl’s company (a tier of cells) had a seemingly routine shakedown. But when his cell opened, he recalled, two officers wearing black leather gloves rushed in and rained down blows on him. Beaten and handcuffed, Fischl was dragged off to “the box,” also known as solitary.</p>

<p>To Fischl, the beatdown was no mystery: The C Block COs had been slighted when the reprimanded inmate got to keep his dreads. So they got payback.</p>

<p>Fischl received a misbehavior report saying he had assaulted the officers by lunging at them with a shank. At the disciplinary hearing, it was Fischl’s word against the COs’. At the time, there were no surveillance cameras in the cellblocks at Attica—Fischl had no evidence to counter the allegations against him. He was found guilty, and received nearly a year of box time plus the loss of all privileges during that period: commissary, phones, packages. (The New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, or DOCCS, declined to comment on specific incidents described in this story.)</p>

<p>It’s worth pausing to note that Fischl has been on and off the caseload of the state prison system’s Office of Mental Health (OMH) and is sometimes given to psychotic episodes. So his account may not be entirely reliable.</p>

<p>But for those of us who have served time in Attica, one of America’s most notorious prisons, Fischl’s ordeal was business as usual. Attica’s dirtiest little secret, as documented by Tom Robbins for The Marshall Project and The New York Times, is that for years, officers had been falsifying misbehavior reports and lying about being assaulted to justify using force on prisoners. From January 2010 to November 2013, there were 228 assault on staff tickets filed at Attica, according to a 2014 report by the Correctional Association of New York, a watchdog nonprofit. At the disciplinary hearings, 227 prisoners were found guilty of at least one infraction on the ticket. And the large majority, 212, were found guilty of the assault on staff claim, which typically meant several months in the box. The CO’s word prevailed against that of the prisoner in every case but one.</p>

<p>Listen to an audio version of this story:</p>

<p>Among many New York State prisoners, Attica has long been considered the worst maximum security joint to serve time in. Near Buffalo, about 350 miles northwest of New York City, which is home for most prisoners, it's a haul for families to visit. Seventy-six percent of the 2,026 prisoners are black or Hispanic; the approximately 600 COs are mostly white. The wall, the skies, the mood—they’re all gray, seemingly every day. Stories about setups and beatdown crews have long reverberated throughout the prison system. Over the years, the Correctional Association of New York has documented harrowing tales of harassment, pervasive racism, retaliation against prisoners filing grievances, excessive box time in disciplinary hearings, and more.</p>

<p>But that was before video surveillance came to Attica. By April 2015, cameras were being installed throughout the prison—as of January 2018, there were 1,875 cameras and 915 microphones, according to DOCCS. “The cameras are a valuable tool in the ongoing battle against drugs and contraband in the State’s prisons, as well as an asset in investigations into incidents involving both inmates and staff,” a DOCCS official said, adding that plans were underway for the installation of additional cameras at other state prison facilities.</p>

<p>Cameras at Attica have provided an unprecedented level of transparency and accountability for corrections officers. And they’ve been followed closely by a remarkable occurence: Official reports of assaults on staff have dropped drastically. In 2014, the last year without surveillance, there were 64 assault on staff reports, according to a DOCCS report. The 10-year annual average was 50, and in no year during the period before cameras did the number drop below 30.</p>

<p>From May 2016 to May 2017, as cameras came close to being fully installed, incidents dropped nearly 80 percent from the last year without cameras, to 13. In about this same period, staff reported 40 percent fewer injuries than the previous year.</p>

<p>According to DOCCS, the decline of assaults on staff can be attributed in part to the cameras but also to several other recent initiatives, including additional training for security staff, de-escalation tactics, and a pepper spray program. These changes were introduced around the same time the cameras were being installed.</p>

<p>But I have a different interpretation of this data: Under today’s watchful eyes, Attica COs are less inclined to falsify misbehavior reports and make bogus allegations of assaults by prisoners than they used to be. They are also less likely to file false injury claims, which can result in months of paid leave at the taxpayers’ expense.</p>

<p>After reporting this story for two years as a prison journalist, gleaning data from official corrections reports, interviewing prisoners, COs, and the former superintendent, I can also say that cameras and microphones seem to have accomplished what once seemed impossible at Attica. They have begun to tame a violent us-against-them culture that formed decades earlier in the prison’s most defining moment.</p>

<p>The only question is, will the relative peace continue?</p>

<p>they better think of Attica and the 1971 riot. Ever since, the prison has been romanticized—in Hollywood (Al Pacino in “Dog Day Afternoon”), in music (the other John Lennon's "Attica State" or Nas rapping "I’d open every cell in Attica, send ’em to Africa”), in those iconic photos of prisoners in the yard, fists up (Power to the people!). The Attica uprising has also been demonized—lies told about the event, according to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Heather Ann Thompson, helped fuel mass incarceration. A state commission wrote in 1972 that the police assault that ended the uprising was, with the exception of late-19th century Native American massacres, “the bloodiest one-day encounter between Americans since the Civil War.”</p>

<p>I landed at Attica in 2007. Six years earlier, while caught up in the drug-dealer lifestyle, I shot and killed a man on a Brooklyn street. Soon after, I was caught, tried, convicted and sentenced to an aggregate term of 28 years to life—25 for the murder and three more for drug sales. Of my more than 16 years incarcerated in jails on Rikers Island and in maximum security prisons in upstate New York, I spent nine in Attica.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to get involved with programs at the prison that helped me change my life. In a 12-step meeting hosted by civilian community members in recovery, I got sober. In a privately-funded college program, I earned an associate's degree. In a creative-writing workshop taught by an English professor, I learned how to write. I took to journalism and soon saw Attica as a never-ending story.</p>

<p>Still, it was a nasty joint. I’d served time in other max prisons, but only in Attica did I see COs make their own rules. Only in Attica were men subjected to random frisks entailing the infamous “credit card swipe,” in which a CO would run his hand up the crack of a prisoner’s ass. Only in Attica did they restrict prisoners to once-a-week law library access. Only in Attica was I limited to two showers per week (in other joints, it’s three.) Only in Attica did shirts, sweatshirts, even sweaters have to be fully tucked. (It looked ridiculous.) Only in Attica did COs constantly carry their batons strapped to their wrists, tumbling them in and out of their hands like yo-yos. It was unsettling to be walking the corridors with a CO right behind you, baton in hand.</p>

<p>Turn around and you got, "Eyes forward!"</p>

<p>Wrapped in more than a mile of wall are piles of brick that make up Attica’s five cellblocks—A, B, C, D, and E. At one time or another, I lived in every one of them. The action—between prisoners, between COs and prisoners—went down in the corridors, in the cellblocks (A and C were the worst), the foyers, the companies, and the yard. Until recently, none of these areas had cameras.</p>

<p>For the most part, discipline in Attica followed this drill: Head down, clipboard and pen in hand, a CO would speed-walk the tier, taking the mess hall and yard list. Prisoners who weren’t on their bars would miss the list and starve and go stir crazy. No mess hall. No yard. If a prisoner yelled a heads up that the officer was coming, or if there was loud singing, maybe a freestyle rap battle, the COs would cut off the electricity on the entire company.</p>

<p>Sometimes the officer would make it more personal, taking to the catwalk in the back of the cells and yanking out the electrical wires or pulling the fuse for a cell of a particular prisoner. The prisoner singled out for special attention usually got an "asshole" tag on the cell electrical panel in the COs’ station, meaning his cell likely wouldn't open for mess hall or yard runs. If the guy was lucky, some passing friend would toss him a few ramen noodles from commissary so he wouldn't go hungry. It’s called being “on the burn.” It sucks.</p>

<p>On rare occasions, a prisoner would lash out in response. This is what I believe happened when Shondell Paul stabbed two A Block COs in 2004. Back then, I was in Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora with his brother, Tajuan Paul. Tajuan, or “TP,” was my poker buddy, and we worked as porters. Together, the Paul brothers were serving more than 200 years for robbing and killing people at street craps games in Syracuse. What we heard was that Attica COs had been harassing and burning Shondell. He got tired of it. When his cell finally opened for a mess hall run, he had a 7-and-a-half-inch shank taped to his wrist. He casually walked into the foyer, slid the shank into his palm, and unleashed fury.</p>

<p>But calculated attacks like that were rare. When they happened, prisoners were happy to spread the news, as if they were celebrating a winning battle in the us-them war.</p>

<p>Most incidents were frustratingly reported by the prison rumor mill, and sounded a lot like this: Kenneth Harris, whose nickname is Justice, was nearly four years in on an 11-to-20 year sentence for robbery. After a disagreement with a favored prisoner, Harris said, it didn’t take long for C Block COs to red-flag him, especially since his pedigree indicated he was a Blood. On March 19, 2014, Harris’s cell opened, he thought, so he could help cut hair in the C Block barbershop, as he’d done a few times before. When he entered the cellblock lobby, he told me, COs told him to grab the wall. It was the so-called beatdown crew. They latched the foyer doors and posted officers at both ends of the corridor.</p>

<p>Then it went down—blows to the back of his head. Harris hit the deck, curled up and covered up. Then they put the boots to him, chipping one of his front teeth and loosening another.</p>

<p>I was in C Block when this happened. Beatdowns were so common and calculated, we’d hear them but never see them. I’d be in my cell, hear batons tap on the floor—clack clack clack—and then two bells like fire alarms. Then the boom of the boots, keys jangling, COs running to the scene.</p>

<p>“Stop resisting!”</p>

<p>“I’m not resisting!”</p>

<p>Then screams. Then silence.</p>

<p>Harris’s incident sounded like so many before and after. I’d become numb to them. Apathy provided a psychological safe space in Attica; it’s better to appear stoic and indifferent than shocked and empathetic. At first it’s an act. Then it’s not.</p>

<p>A lumped and bruised Harris was taken to the prison hospital, where he told a nurse about his teeth. Then it was off to the box. Two days later, he said, he was called out to the dentist, who bonded the chipped tooth and performed a root canal on the loose one. When Harris received the misbehavior ticket—assault on staff, weapon, and more—it said that while he was being frisked on the wall, a shank fell out of his waistband and as an officer bent to grab it, Harris kneed him in the head. Then, a report detailing the use of force claimed, three COs used strikes, mechanical restraints, and body holds to get a combative Harris under control. According to the report, the only injury Harris suffered during the incident was an abrasion on his left clavicle.</p>

<p>At the disciplinary hearing, Harris pleaded not guilty and tried to explain that he’d never seen the shank before and that the incident didn’t go down as described in the ticket. Nonetheless, he was found guilty and received 160 days box time, 200 days loss of privileges, and three months recommended loss of good time on his sentence.</p>

<p>The history of false misbehavior reports at Attica goes back at least as far as the uprising. On Sept. 13, 1971, the fifth day of the takeover, COs and state police troopers in Grim Reaper get-ups—gas masks, raincoats, no name tags, locked and loaded—fired more than 400 rounds in the D yard. Among the dead were 29 prisoners, six officers, and four state workers, including CO William Quinn, who was pummeled to death when the uprising began. Adding three prisoners stabbed to death, and another CO who died a month later from injuries sustained during the riot, the toll was 43. When the gas cleared, state officials reported that the prisoners had killed hostages—slit their throats, mutilated their faces, disemboweled one, and even castrated a CO and stuffed his genitals in his mouth. All lies.</p>

<p>Later that week, Dr. John Edlund, a medical examiner, revealed that all the hostages had died of gunshot wounds. But the prisoners never had guns.</p>

<p>After the uprising, there was payback. Prisoners were prosecuted, most for their roles in Quinn's murder and the deaths of the three stabbed prisoners. A couple were convicted, a few were acquitted, and scores were indicted. Only one state trooper was ever indicted—for reckless endangerment (the charges were later dismissed).</p>

<p>In March 1975, a lawyer from the prosecution’s camp leaked to the The New York Times that overwhelming evidence, which would implicate some of the COs and troopers in some of the killings, was being ignored. Weeks later, the Times ran an expose and the administration started scrambling. In December 1976, New York Gov. Hugh Carey gave sweeping clemency to the prisoners and blocked disciplinary action against law enforcement. Since then, my take is that many Attica COs, some of whom were related to or friends of officers killed or wounded in the uprising, felt peer pressure to live up to the prison’s notorious reputation and enact payback. They maintained control by instilling fear, battering prisoners who were easy prey.</p>

<p>In the past few years, more than a thousand cameras have been installed throughout Attica Correctional Facility.</p>

<p>For decades, the Correctional Association, and prisoners themselves, called on state legislators to put cameras in Attica to help protect the population from violent COs. In 2007, when I arrived, Attica had cameras in only a few areas of the prison. One was the mess hall, which was housed in a sublime neo-Gothic brick structure with vaulted ceilings and thick, marble-like columns, and contained row on row of metal picnic tables. A CO sat in an elevated glass bubble with his thumb on the tear-gas button. But nothing ever really happened in the mess hall. Cameras were also installed in the special housing unit cellblock, or the box, as well as the secure therapy areas. But nothing much happens there, either, because everyone is locked in.</p>

<p>In 2014, a swath of eye-in-the-sky cameras were installed in the ceilings of Attica's two visiting rooms. While there was a need for them (they would probably deter and catch some smuggled contraband like drugs, which contribute to much of prison violence), I was curious why cameras weren't going where they would capture the real eyebrow-raising stuff. According to the rumor mill, the corrections officers union had a say in where the cameras were being installed—I think the security staff just didn't want Big Brother in Albany watching how they maintained order.</p>

<p>Then, in February 2015, The Marshall Project and The New York Times co-published Tom Robbins’s story “Attica's Ghosts," about three officers who were indicted for the near-fatal 2011 beating of a prisoner named George Williams—the first in a series investigating violence by COs against inmates in New York state prisons.</p>

<p>It was the first time in state history that a guard had been prosecuted for brutality against someone in prison, according to the Correctional Association. A plea deal was struck a day after the article was published: In exchange for quitting their jobs, the COs pleaded to a single misdemeanor count. (In April 2016, The Marshall Project and New York Times series was named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in investigative reporting.)</p>

<p>By the summer of 2015, a few months after Robbins’s first piece ran, cameras and microphones were being installed throughout Attica: in the corridors, yards, cellblocks, foyers, stairwells, companies, everywhere.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask the man in charge what prompted this sudden surge in surveillance. At the time, that was Dale Artus, a clean-cut man in his fifties who sports a politician’s smile. Artus began his career as a CO and came up through the ranks to become superintendent. In August 2016, he strolled into the cellblock while I was swinging a mop. It was good timing—Artus doesn't usually give interviews.</p>

<p>“I give you a lot of credit," I said, preparing to lay it on thick. “A lot has changed since you've been at the helm. The cameras have really made a difference.”</p>

<p>"Yeah, I agree,” he told me. “A few days ago, in the metal shop, an inmate punched a civilian." (Civilian instructors work in the metal shop at Attica, where prisoners make desks and lockers for New York municipalities.) "COs responded, contained it, and took the guy to the box. If that had happened a couple of years ago, John, you know what would have happened."</p>

<p>"So let me ask you this, how are the COs feeling about the cameras?"</p>

<p>"Some couldn't handle them," Artus explained, cocking his head to the side, palms upward. "So, they had to go … Some retired, some transferred to different prisons, some bid different posts." In the end, it was the right thing to do, he said, and it's made a huge difference. (In an email, a DOCCS spokesperson said that attrition and requests for reassignment for corrections officers have not changed at Attica since cameras were installed.)</p>

<p>When I asked him if the cameras were a direct result of Robbins's article, he told me they had been approved for some time. "But what that article did do was put Attica under a microscope,” he added. "And because of that, cameras and mics were installed all over, every crevice, no blind spots. And I welcome that."</p>

<p>(Reached by The Marshall Project and VICE in February, Artus declined to comment on the conversation.)</p>

<p>With today's transparency, officers are compelled to be more professional. In October 2016, I spoke to a chatty, old-timer CO.</p>

<p>"There's been some hiccups, but those cameras are HD clear,” he told me, asking to remain anonymous to avoid angering his colleagues.</p>

<p>"And the mics…. Oh boy! If a mouse pissed on a cotton ball, you’d hear it."</p>

<p>If he were telling this to me, I thought, then he must have been telling his peers, too—which meant COs were changing the way they operated.</p>

<p>A young officer, who also asked me not to use his name for fear of reprisals, told me he welcomes the oversight. “Look man, in many ways the cameras are good,” he said. If they had been in place earlier, he added, there would have been countless fewer violent incidents between prisoners and officers.</p>

<p>With Big Brother watching, some prisoners are now more nervy with COs. Take an incident in the fall of 2016 when Gary McKenzie—21 years, manslaughter—was walking with a group of prisoners, including me, headed to evening program. Paired off, no talking, we knew the deal. As we passed some COs, McKenzie was pulled off the line by an officer who told him to tuck in his shirt. McKenzie replied that his shirt was tucked in. (It was sloppily tucked.) A back and forth ensued. The CO told McKenzie to get back in line, calling him an “asshole." McKenzie returned the insult. The COs did nothing. I was shocked. The next day, McKenzie received a misbehavior report for refusing a "direct order."</p>

<p>At the hearing he pleaded not guilty and requested the videotape in order to prove that his shirt was indeed tucked in. The lieutenant reviewed the tape and dismissed the ticket. Before cameras, prisoners hardly ever got around direct-order tickets because the word of the CO had always trumped the prisoner's. Now, the tale of the tape decides.</p>

<p>Many of the old guard feel Attica has lost its “overall team spirit”—or at least that’s how CO Gary "Preacher" Pritchard characterized the changing Attica workplace culture in a deposition for a lawsuit against him. It’s possible Preacher got his nickname from prisoners mispronouncing his real name, yet, with tattoos of “Jesus” and quotes like "Angels All Around Me," the name fits. He is given to self-righteous comments in an eerie drawl, posturing in front of his peers and prisoners in earshot with lines like, "We're the ones who protect society from these guys."</p>

<p>Over his 25-plus year career, Pritchard's been named in at least 24 federal civil rights lawsuits filed by prisoners, as reported by Robbins. I was around Pritchard for years. With a blond crop cut, baton in hand, backed by his crew in blue, Pritchard talks slow and fishes for fear in wide-eyed newbies; he’s on the prowl especially for sexual predators and LGBTQ prisoners. In 2015, the state settled a federal lawsuit against Pritchard and another CO for allegedly beating up transgender prisoner Misty LaCroix, blackening her eye and breaking her rib. LaCroix received $80,000.</p>

<p>At the end of 2015, a sunken-faced Pritchard appeared while working on my company in A Block. Cameras and mics in the area were recently operational. There was loud music, weed in the air, shouts echoing up and down the company—and, surprisingly, Pritchard kept his cool. The prison din was something he'd never tolerated in the past. Now, he'd sit at his station, often in conversation with another CO, seemingly tamed by the cameras and mics.</p>

<p>That's when I realized Attica's culture really was beginning to change.</p>

<p>And yet it bothered me that society would define the lives of me and my peers by our worst deeds and be none the wiser about Pritchard's. It bothered me that he would never be punished for his actions and that he was protected by a corrections union and received, through their negotiations, a comfortable six-figure salary and generous pension.</p>

<p>On Nov. 15, 2016, I was transferred to Sing Sing, just up the river from New York City. The prison is much less intense. Batons stay on hips. COs talk to you, not at you. As a group, they’re more diverse than Attica officers; here they are mostly black and Hispanic, and many are women. When taking the mess hall and yard lists, COs stop at your cell and make sure they hear your request. When prisoners yell "walking" to alert others, COs don't take it as a slight and cut the electricity or burn men on the mess hall and yard. Sing Sing houses about 1,600 prisoners, several hundred fewer than Attica. Cameras are not installed throughout the prison, and yet the 10-year annual average for assault on staff reports is 30, dropping as low as 15, according to DOCCS data from 2005-2014.</p>

<p>I'd surmise that most of those reports are accurate. In Sing Sing, some prisoners forget that officers have the same power to make or break their day, just like the ones upstate. One recent morning, a group of us were waiting in the corridor to go to the yard. A CO at the end of the corridor was also apparently waiting for clearance to let us out. A voice from the crowd yelled, "What you waitin' on, house nigga? Let us out!"</p>

<p>That would've never happened in Attica. In my short time here, I've seen prisoners yell at COs, get in their faces. I even saw a fist fight in the yard between a prisoner and an officer, who at one point was dropped by a left hook. When backup came, they didn't pound on the prisoner; instead, they cuffed him and took him to the box. Prisoners made dopey comments, laughing at the CO. I felt like we were the villains. For the first time, I felt, maybe Attica COs knew what they were doing all along.</p>

<p>It was a fleeting thought.</p>

<p>Recently, a prisoner I was with in Attica arrived in Sing Sing, and told me the worst of the old guard had left, the setups and beatdowns were over, and COs now use pepper spray instead of batons. He also told me the prisoners have turned more aggressive as COs demonstrated their restraint before the cameras. I can’t help but sympathize with the new generation of Attica COs, who enjoy less generous pensions and closer scrutiny while paying for the sins of their predecessors.</p>

<p>Kenneth Harris says he was beaten by correctional officers at Attica Correctional Facility and then put in solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Today, Kenneth Harris, the target of that Attica beatdown, is here with me in Sing Sing. He told me the only violent blot on his 10-year institutional record was that alleged assault on staff. "That shit was crazy,” he told me in the barbershop, where he was buzzing another prisoner's hair. "From the box I went to Clinton, couldn't get a program, my people were harassed on the visit—all for some shit I didn't even do.”</p>

<p>Until a recent transfer, Josef Fischl, of the dreadlock incident, was also here with me in Sing Sing. He was sporting a buzz cut. His institutional record is packed with misbehavior reports, but in almost 30 years he's never cut or stabbed a prisoner or CO—the Attica report is the only one, as of fall 2017, that said he was violent with a weapon. He has been written up for other assault on staff violations, however. “I have these episodes," he said, smiling, "and things sometimes get out of hand."</p>

<p>Fischl has been variously diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In past lives, he told me, he was crucified between two men in a desert; he helped build the pyramids; he was an American Indian. One time, he said, he felt the strength of the T-Rex dinosaur he had been in one of his fantastic incarnations. “I was too big for that prison," he told me. "Those measly human COs couldn't hold me."</p>

<p>Several months ago, Fischl had an episode in Sing Sing. He was crawling like a crab in the yard, vibing the sea creature he told me he used to be back when Earth had no land. Sing Sing COs escorted him to disciplinary, tested his urine for drugs. When he became psychotic, they restrained him, non-violently, and took him to mental health. He was sent to the Central New York Psychiatric Center.</p>

<p>Psych meds make him feel like a zombie, so he doesn't take them. He’s intense, almost to the point of being annoying, but in our conversations, he’s been lucid. I asked him if, given his file at the Office of Mental Health, he was sure his story of the Attica COs wasn’t a psychotic episode. He smirked, leaned his head to the side, and squinted his eyes at me as if I were stupid.</p>

<p>"Nah man, I wasn't even seeing OMH back then. They beat me up and set me up because they didn't like my dreads,” he said. "Come on Johnny, you were there, you know what they do."</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<h2 id="whyarejoebidenandthenraendorsingstatejudges">Why Are Joe Biden and the NRA Endorsing State Judges?</h2>

<p>by: Christie Thompson</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-04</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/04/03/why-are-joe-biden-and-the-nra-endorsing-state-judges </p>

<p>Wisconsin voters will choose a new state supreme court justice Tuesday, in a technically non-partisan race that has drawn national political attention, million-dollar campaigns, and “soft-on-crime” attack ads from both sides. The election is just the latest in a nationwide trend of once-quiet judicial elections transforming into expensive, politicized fights, which experts fear could threaten the impartiality of the courts.</p>

<p>Research by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice found that $2.6 million has been spent so far on TV and radio advertising in the Wisconsin race. National interests have weighed in, with the National Rifle Association endorsing conservative Judge Michael Screnock. Meanwhile Former Vice President Joe Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder have voiced their support for the more liberal candidate, Judge Rebecca Dallet. The National Democratic Redistricting Committee, a new group chaired by Holder and focused on gerrymandering, spent $165,000 on digital ads for Dallet.</p>

<p>Circuit Court Judge Michael Screnock is a candidate for the Wisconsin Supreme Court and has received the backing of the National Rifle Association.</p>

<p>Some fear that the national political involvement will warp voters’ understanding of the court and its role. “The more national attention and endorsements that come into this race, the more it looks like any other political contest,” said Douglas Keith, counsel at the Brennan Center. “Public perceptions really do matter — they need to have faith that the courts are somehow different than the legislature and the governor.” Some states, and almost every country other than the United States, opt to appoint judges rather than elect them to assure they follow the law rather than public opinion.</p>

<p>The National Democratic Redistricting Committee said in its ads that Dallet would “stop big money in politics” and “protect our court and our rights.” While Wisconsin’s contested legislative maps (currently under review by the U.S. Supreme Court) were not mentioned specifically, influencing redistricting is the main focus of the organization. “What we are trying to do nationwide is to make sure that we put in place people who will do redistricting in a fair way come 2021, unlike what was done in 2011, and specifically what was done here in Wisconsin,” Holder said in a local TV interview.</p>

<p>This election won’t upend the ideological balance of Wisconsin’s highest court: conservative justices outnumber liberals five to two. Some think national political groups are treating this election — even a low-turnout, nonpartisan state supreme court race — as a possible bellwether of how the upcoming midterm elections will go.</p>

<p>Other states have seen recent fights over redistricting further politicize judicial elections. In the 2016 North Carolina supreme court race, a liberal political action committee called North Carolina Families First aired ads that criticized Justice Bob Edmunds for upholding convoluted legislative maps that critics say segregated black voters. (A federal court ruled the maps had to be redrawn, then the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the district court’s opinion in January). Barack Obama also entered the fray and endorsed Edmunds’ opponent, Mike Morgan, who ultimately won. More recently, state GOP legislators in Pennsylvania filed to impeach four state supreme court justices after they ruled the state’s legislative map was gerrymandered to benefit Republicans.</p>

<p>The Next To Die </p>

<p>“As we saw recently in Pennsylvania, state Supreme Courts often rule on or even draw legislative maps, which is why it’s so important to have justices who favor fair redistricting,” a spokesperson for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee said in an email, explaining their involvement in the Wisconsin race.</p>

<p>Most of the money in Tuesday’s election has come from state groups: the Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce’s Issue Mobilization Committee on the right, and the Greater Wisconsin Committee on the left. Both groups are registered as social welfare organizations that do not have to disclose their donors, which can obscure their political motives.</p>

<p>Outside groups and the candidates’ own campaigns have used the well-worn tactic of accusing opponents of being too lenient on sex offenders and other violent criminals, often by focusing on individual cases without context. An ad by Dallet’s campaign called out Screnock for “[letting] a rapist who preyed on an underage girl go free after only an eight month sentence.” On the other side, the Wisconsin Manufacturers &amp; Commerce criticized Dallet for giving a sexual predator who abused his granddaughters two years in prison instead of 20. (The family called for the ad — which named the offender and thus could be used to identify his victims — to be taken down.) Research suggests such campaign rhetoric can make judges less likely to rule in favor of criminal defendants long after the election is decided.</p>

<p>“Our screens are being splattered with mud here these last couple weeks by outside groups claiming that the candidate on the other side is not tough enough on crime,” said Matthew Rothschild, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a local nonpartisan group focused on elections and judicial integrity. “Wisconsin is supposed to have nonpartisan supreme court races, but they have become highly politicized.”</p>

<p>Update 12:13 p.m. 04.04.2018</p>

<p>Judge Rebecca Dallet won the election with 56 percent of the vote. The Wisconsin state supreme court now has a smaller conservative majority, 4-3.</p>

<p>A Special Housing Unit at Onondaga County Justice Center in Syracuse, N.Y. NYCLU</p>

<p>When the police approached Imani and her friends outside a Syracuse, N.Y., dollar store in 2016, she wasn’t worried — she didn’t believe they had done anything wrong. But a clerk at the store had accused the group of stealing, and Imani, then 16 years old, was arrested and charged with robbery. Unable to afford bail, she waited for her day in court in a maximum-security adult jail.</p>

<p>Imani, petite and wiry, is small for her age. At the Onondaga County Justice Center she was constantly cold, the single jail-issued blanket doing little to keep her warm. After arguing with a guard over a grievance she had filed, she was promptly moved to the solitary confinement wing of the jail, she said. Her meals were fed to her through a slot in the door and her recreation time was spent outside in what seemed like “a cage for a dog,” Imani said. The Marshall Project and WNYC are not using her real name because her juvenile record is sealed.</p>

<p>“I’m ready to come home,” she thought to herself as hours turned to days in isolation. The Onondaga County Sheriff’s Office, which runs the jail, referred calls to a county spokesman, who did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Solitary confinement is not allowed for inmates younger than 18 at federal and state-run facilities in New York, but for teens like Imani — held in a county jail, waiting for their cases to be heard — it’s a common practice. Local jails use solitary as punishment, and since many counties rarely have separate facilities for juveniles, isolation cells are also routinely used as holding cells for minors.</p>

<p>“It made me feel like nothing, like an animal,” Imani said of her 32 days spent in solitary. “Can’t call nobody, can’t talk to nobody. You just feel worthless.”</p>

<p>Perhaps most well-known is the case of Kalief Browder, a Bronx 16-year-old charged with stealing a backpack who spent three years at New York City’s infamous Rikers Island jail complex. He passed more than two years of it in solitary confinement, steadfastly maintaining his innocence. Eventually, the charges were dismissed and Browder was released, but his time in solitary had caused significant mental health issues. He committed suicide at 22 years old in 2015, just two years after his release. His case garnered national attention and eventually led the New York City Department of Correction to ban the use of solitary confinement for inmates under 18.</p>

<p>Yet outside of New York City, teenagers held in jail often don’t warrant special treatment. A Marshall Project review of the 10 counties outside of New York City that detain the largest populations of juveniles shows that at least seven allow holding juveniles in solitary. The remaining three did not respond to inquiries.</p>

<p>In 2016, the last year for which records are available, more than 3,700 16- and 17-year-olds were held in jail in New York’s 57 counties outside of New York City. It is difficult to know precisely how many are placed in isolation because county jails are not required to track the age of inmates locked in isolation.</p>

<p>In recent years, studies have revealed the damaging effects of solitary on all prisoners, including anxiety and an increased risk of self-harm and suicide. “Social deprivation is not a good practice for anybody,” said Dr. Carly Baetz, an assistant professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at New York University’s School of Medicine. Incarceration is hard, but “isolation alone is a traumatic experience,” she said.</p>

<p>The risks are worse for teenagers, who are still developing intellectually and emotionally.</p>

<p>“You’re just surrounded by four walls with a dim light — no cellmate, no commissary, no pictures of your family,” said Jordan, who was 16 when he was arrested for burglary and detained at the Onondaga County Justice Center in 2015. “All you can think about is death, because you feel like you’re gone already.” The Marshall Project is using his middle name.</p>

<p>Jordan tried to sleep through his first day in solitary. “The second day, waking up to my door slot being opened, was probably the worst sound I’ve ever heard in my life,” he said.</p>

<p>Josh Cotter, an attorney with Legal Services of Central New York, has led several lawsuits across the state challenging the use of isolation for teenagers in jails, especially those who have not been convicted of any crime. “Kids just aren’t little adults — they’re kids,” he said. “They have different needs.”</p>

<p>When Imani arrived at the Justice Center in 2016, the jail was already burned into her mind as the place where her step-sister had died in 2009 from an ectopic pregnancy. She had repeatedly asked officers for medical attention. “They didn’t care, they didn’t do nothing,” Imani said. The county settled a wrongful death lawsuit with the family for $385,000.</p>

<p>Imani didn’t know what to expect. “I was just 16,” she said. “I ain’t know.”</p>

<p>Even after her release, she felt the effects of solitary lingering. “You still feel like an animal sometimes,” said Imani, who is now 18 and thinking about getting her GED.</p>

<p>In 2016, Cotter sued the Onondaga County Sheriff’s Office and the Syracuse City School District. The Justice Center, Cotter claimed, routinely used isolation as discipline for minor misbehavior. One teen was placed in solitary for banging on his cell door to get the deputy’s attention so he could tell him he felt suicidal. Others were put in solitary for singing, talking loudly, and wearing shower shoes outside of the shower. Once in isolation, the teens no longer had phone privileges, couldn’t go to school, and received only one hour outside of their barren cell each day.</p>

<p>Jordan was one of the lead plaintiffs in Cotter’s case. When the jail didn’t allow him to go to school while in solitary, it was a “slap in the face, saying that they didn’t care about any possible future for me,” Jordan said. “It really hurts your brain and your soul because all you can think about is you not leaving that cell.”</p>

<p>The county settled the case in 2017, agreeing to significantly limit the use of solitary confinement, develop a system that rewards good behavior, and improve education services. “Young people don’t respond well to punitive threats,” said Alex Frank of the Vera Institute’s Center on Youth Justice. “They respond to being recognized when they’re doing something well.”</p>

<p>Among the nearly two dozen local jail officials who responded to questions from The Marshall Project, many said solitary confinement isn’t just used as punishment. It’s often necessary so jails can comply with a federal anti-rape law requiring minors be kept out of “sight and sound” from adults.</p>

<p>“Our biggest problem is housing them,” said Steven VanCise, a lieutenant at Cortland County Jail. “We don’t have a block for them, so it’s a headache.”</p>

<p>Opening Statement </p>

<p>In 2017, New York passed legislation that raised the age of criminal responsibility from 16 to 18, creating a new class of adolescent offenders and requiring they be housed in specially certified facilities. The state has allocated millions of dollars to update facilities for sentenced teens, but it’s unclear what will happen for 16- and 17-year-olds who are awaiting court. “We have no beds in this county,” said Joseph Gerace, sheriff of Chautauqua County. “We have to house them in special housing units that are not there.”</p>

<p>Late last year, the state Commission of Correction, which oversees county jails, proposed new regulations for solitary confinement: it would still be allowed for teens but with stricter guidelines and more required documentation.</p>

<p>Jails would have to allow teens four hours out of their cells and two hours of exercise. However, if jail staffers deem the teen to be a risk to the safety or “good working order” of the facility, those hours out of the cell can be denied.</p>

<p>Facilities would also have to document any time solitary is used for a minor and provide written justification for denying a minor access to school for each school day missed. The proposal is waiting for final approval.</p>

<p>In the meantime, counties continue to use different strategies for teenagers. Some, with limited space, send teens over to another county, paying for each night spent in the receiving county.</p>

<p>Others try a seemingly simple solution — keeping teens out of jail. “If you’re a kid coming to jail, we’re working hard to get you out,” said Chris Ivers, the jail administrator in Allegany County, where only 14% of arrested teens are admitted to the jail. “You shouldn’t be here.”</p>

<p>Jordan, who is now looking for a job, agrees. “The first day they enter jail, is the last day that they can remain a child,” he said.</p>

<p>The Trump administration’s first year of immigration policy has relied on claims that immigrants bring crime into America. President Trump’s latest target is sanctuary cities.</p>

<p>“Every day, sanctuary cities release illegal immigrants, drug dealers, traffickers, gang members back into our communities,” he said last week. “They’re safe havens for just some terrible people.”</p>

<p>Immigrant populations in the United States have been growing fast for decades now. Crime in the same period, however, has moved in the opposite direction, with the national rate of violent crime today well below what it was in 1980.</p>

<p>In a large-scale collaboration by four universities, led by Robert Adelman, a sociologist at the State University of New York at Buffalo, researchers compared immigration rates with crime rates for 200 metropolitan areas over the last several decades. The selected areas included huge urban hubs like New York and smaller manufacturing centers less than a hundredth that size, like Muncie, Ind., and were dispersed geographically across the country.</p>

<p>Immigrant population and violent crime by metro area</p>

<p>Change between 1980 and 2016</p>

<p>According to data from the study, a large majority of the areas have many more immigrants today than they did in 1980 and fewer violent crimes. The Marshall Project extended the study’s data up to 2016, showing that crime fell more often than it rose even as immigrant populations grew almost across the board.</p>

<p>In 136 metro areas, almost 70 percent of those studied, the immigrant population increased between 1980 and 2016 while crime stayed stable or fell. The number of areas where crime and immigration both increased was much lower — 54 areas, slightly more than a quarter of the total. The 10 places with the largest increases in immigrants all had lower levels of crime in 2016 than in 1980.</p>

<p>And yet the argument that immigrants bring crime into America has driven many of the policies enacted or proposed by the administration so far: restrictions to entry, travel and visas; heightened border enforcement; plans for a wall along the border with Mexico. This month, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against California in response to the state’s refusal to allow local police to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants charged with crimes. On Tuesday, California’s Orange County signed on in support of that suit. But while the immigrant population in the county has more than doubled since 1980, overall violent crime has decreased by more than 50 percent.</p>

<p>There’s a similar pattern in two other places where Trump has recently feuded with local leaders: Oakland, Calif., and Lawrence, Mass. He described both cities as breeding grounds for drugs and crime brought by immigrants. But Oakland, like Orange County, has had increasing immigration and falling crime. In Lawrence, though murder and robbery rates grew, overall violent crime rates still fell by 10 percent.</p>

<p>In general, the study’s data suggests either that immigration has the effect of reducing average crime, or that there is simply no relationship between the two, and that the 54 areas in the study where both grew were instances of coincidence, not cause and effect. This was a consistent pattern in each decade from 1980 to 2016, with immigrant populations and crime failing to grow together.</p>

<p>Click on a line below to see how a metro area has changed since 1980. For example, in Atlanta the immigrant population skyrocketed while violent crime fell. One of the largest decreases in crime occured in Miami, where immigration increased. Wichita, KAN. is one of the 27% of areas where immigration and crime both grew.</p>

<p>In a majority of areas, the number of immigrants increased at least 57 percent and as much as 183 percent, with the greatest increases occurring in the 1990s and early 2000s. Violent crime rates in most areas ranged between a 43 percent decline and a 6 percent rise, often trending downward by the 2000s. Places with a sharp rise in the immigrant population experienced increases in crime rates no more frequently than those with modest or no growth in immigration. On average, the immigrant population grew by 137 percent between 1980 and 2016, with average crime falling 12 percent over the same period.</p>

<p>Because the F.B.I. changed how rape was defined in its crime figures, that category could not be included in this analysis. Focusing on the other components of the violent crime rate — assaults, robberies and murders — still fails to reveal a relationship with immigration rates.</p>

<p>Most areas experienced decreases in all types of violent crime. The change in assault rates ranged from a 34 percent decline to a 29 percent rise, while robbery rates declined in the range of 12 percent to 57 percent, and murder rates declined in the range of 15 percent to 54 percent.</p>

<p>This analysis is one of the most comprehensive longitudinal studies of the local immigrant-crime relationship. It spans decades of metropolitan area data, incorporating places with widely differing social, cultural and economic backgrounds, and a broad range of types of violent crime.</p>

<p>Areas were chosen to reflect a range of immigrant composition, from Wheeling, W. Va., where one in 100 people was born outside the United States, to Miami, where every second person was. Some areas were home to newly formed immigrant communities; other immigrant pockets went back generations. Controlling for population characteristics, unemployment rates and other socioeconomic conditions, the researchers still found that, on average, as immigration increases in American metropolises, crime decreases.</p>

<p>The foreign-born data, which is collected through the census, most likely undercounts the numbers of undocumented immigrants, many of whom might wish to avoid the risk of identifying themselves. They are, however, at least partly represented in the overall foreign-born population counts.</p>

<p>This is not the only study showing that immigration does not increase crime. A broad survey released in January examined years of research on the immigrant-crime connection, concluding that an overwhelming majority of studies found either no relationship between the two or a beneficial one, in which immigrant communities bring economic and cultural revitalization to the neighborhoods they join.</p>

<p>About the data</p>

<p>In the recent study, Adelman and his team collected crime and foreign-born population data for 200 metropolitan statistical areas for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2010. The Marshall Project extended the data set to include 2016, obtaining foreign-born numbers from the American Community Survey one-year estimates and crime figures from the F.B.I. Uniform Crime Reporting Program metropolitan area data sets. When either foreign-born or crime information was unavailable for 2016, the corresponding 2015 data was substituted.</p>

<p>Some metropolitan areas changed over time, growing to include additional regions, or splitting into separate ones. The Marshall Project consulted with the study researchers to determine when a larger area was still an appropriate match to the original described in the study. When an area split into components, raw data from each was added to calculate rates approximating the original region. When no reasonable approximation to the original area could be found, it was marked as missing for 2016.</p>

<p>When an area was missing information for a certain year, that year's data was interpolated using figures from the closest year available. For example, crime numbers were unavailable for Chicago for 2000 and 2010. Data for those years was linearly interpolated using the 1990 and 2016 figures. Charlotte, N.C., was not included in either the 2016 or 2015 U.C.R. metropolitan area data sets, so data from 2010, the most recent year with available data for this area, was used as an estimate.</p>

<p>The U.S. Sentencing Commission is a bipartisan, independent, seven-member panel that sets sentencing guidelines for federal judges. Although it rarely attracts public attention, in recent years it has done more than Congress or the White House to reduce the population of the federal prison system, mainly by recommending lighter sentences for drug offenses.</p>

<p>In the nearly three decades since its creation, those who closely monitor the commission cannot remember a time when a nominee was contested in a Senate confirmation hearing.</p>

<p>But the nomination of Georgetown University Law Professor William G. Otis, a flamboyant advocate of the tougher-on-crime views endorsed by President Trump, has infuriated criminal justice reformers and prodded some senators to consider trying to block the appointment.</p>

<p>“We will not make this an easy vote,” said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. “The commission has been the venue for the biggest and best reforms over the last 20 years.”</p>

<p>Adding to the ire of reformers is a second Trump nominee, U.S. District Court Judge Henry E. Hudson, a favorite of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and a judge who acquired the nickname “Hang ‘Em High” Henry because of the harsh sentences he has meted out.</p>

<p>As a hard-charging prosecutor, he once said he lived “to put people in jail,” and he drew criticism for prosecuting a borderline mentally impaired man in a 1984 rape and murder. When the man was exonerated by DNA evidence after serving five years in prison, the judge said he saw no reason to apologize.</p>

<p>But the 70-year-old judge is viewed as fair-minded, according to attorneys who have faced him. His nomination to the federal bench by President George W. Bush in 2002 easily won Senate confirmation.</p>

<p>Otis’ nomination, on the other hand, is regarded by critics as putting a fox in the henhouse. Before a House subcommittee in 2011, he called for abolishing the Sentencing Commission altogether, declaring that its guidelines “favor the criminal” and labeling it “an overfed lemur” that costs too much and no longer has the respect of the judiciary.</p>

<p>An influential conservative op-ed writer and cable news contributor, Otis has served as a federal prosecutor in Virginia, an advisor for the Drug Enforcement Administration and special counsel to President George H. W. Bush.</p>

<p>Messages left for Otis through Georgetown Law and for Hudson at the Richmond, Va., federal courthouse were not returned.</p>

<p>Otis’ musings on federal sentencing trends can be found on the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation-sponsored blog, Crime and Consequences, as well as in news interviews or Congressional testimony over the years.</p>

<p>In blog posts, he has written that he believes the harsh crime policies and War on Drugs prosecutions of the 1980s and 1990s contributed to the precipitous crime rate drop in subsequent decades.</p>

<p>Become a Member </p>

<p>“Our whole sentencing system that started in the Reagan-Bush era, the system of guidelines and mandatory minimums has been a big success,” he said. “If one judges the success of the criminal justice system by the crime rate rather than the incarceration rate, under the system we've had and that Jeff Sessions is now restoring, there has been a tremendous fall-off in crime.”</p>

<p>Most researchers who have studied the drop in crime that began in 1991 agree that locking up more people played some role — but at a high cost in dollars, damaged communities and racial inequity. People of color are disproportionately represented in the nation’s jails and prisons.</p>

<p>In a 2013 blog post, Otis defended a judge who said blacks and Hispanics are “more violent than whites” and added that “Orientals” hold “values” that keep them out of jail.</p>

<p>He has mocked scholars who disagree with him, writing on one occasion that “liberal academics don't have to live in crime racked neighborhoods — a fate foisted off on Lesser People.”</p>

<p>He has said sentencing reform proposals to keep “low-level offenders” out of prison are misleading.</p>

<p>“Low-level offenders seems to me to be an undefined phrase,” he said. “You don't know exactly what low level means. Often it's used to mean a courier in a drug business. What people don't realize as much as they should is that a courier in the drug business is just as essential as a car is in a pizza delivery business.”</p>

<p>Sentencing reform, he said, is “part of our country's recent pattern of decline and retreat, of settling for lower standards in the name of a toxic brand of equality.”</p>

<p>“Increasingly, we have turned away from America's strength and resolve, and have discounted the interests of those who lead peaceable and productive lives in order to cut breaks to those who don't,” he wrote. “The way forward in criminal sentencing is not an embrace of the soft thinking and disastrous results of the Sixties and Seventies.”</p>

<p>In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, FAMM urged senators to oppose Otis, calling him “an ideologue who seems impervious to evidence and data.” Otis has asserted that “when we have more prison, we have less crime,” FAMM said. But crime rates and incarceration rates have declined at the same time for most of last decade.</p>

<p>Kent S. Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, defended Otis in a blog post, saying the Georgetown professor is unfairly picked apart on issues of race and for being “behind the times.”</p>

<p>“In subjects this controversial, if nobody hates you, you aren't accomplishing anything,” Scheidegger wrote. “The people saying Bill is a throwback to the 80s are themselves a throwback to the 60s. They have forgotten the history of deluding ourselves into thinking we could magically rehabilitate all criminals, and their policies would condemn America to repeat that history.”</p>

<p>“Bill has a sharp legal mind,” Scheidegger said in an email to The Marshall Project. “Personally, I have found him to be a kind, gracious, and generous person. As for working with others on the commission, he would certainly be a vigorous debater. He can ‘disagree without being disagreeable,’ and if those on the other side of the fence can also then that debate can be constructive. If they choose to stoop to tactics such as seeing racists under every bed, that will be a problem with them rather than him.”</p>

<h2 id="therecidivismtrap">The Recidivism Trap</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-03-13</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/03/14/the-recidivism-trap </p>

<p>Any discussion of criminal justice policy inevitably includes the word “recidivism.” Usually more than once. Recidivism is the reoccurrence of crime among people known to have committed crimes before. At all levels of justice, from local probation offices to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, if we judge the impact of interventions at all, we do so in part by measuring recidivism.</p>

<p>In a report we published today with the Harvard Kennedy School, we conclude that recidivism is often the wrong measure. And using it exclusively to assess the quality of justice is like using a school’s dropout rate to measure the success of teachers—it may be pertinent, but it is inadequate and often misleading.</p>

<p>First, recidivism is not reducible to the behavior of individuals. For example, an illegal act cannot become the basis for recidivism until it is reported to law enforcement. And many crimes, including half of all violent crimes, are never reported to police, according to the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p>

<p>Social context also matters. Naturally, law violators have different statistical probabilities of coming into contact with police depending on where they live. In America, where one lives is largely determined by income and demographics. Pound for pound, poor people and people of color are more likely to be surveilled by law enforcement and more likely to be among those considered recidivists.</p>

<p>Rather than asking “what’s the recidivism rate?” we should ask an entirely different set of questions about justice interventions. Are we really helping people convicted of crimes to form better relationships with their families and their law-abiding friends? Are we helping them to advance their educational goals? Are they more likely to develop the skills and abilities required for stable employment? Are we helping them to respect others and to participate positively in the civic and cultural life of their communities?</p>

<p>These questions are critical because they look beyond the “yes or no” of recidivism and focus on factors that we know moderate criminal behavior—social bonds, education attainment, employment; they all facilitate what researchers call “desistance,” or the process by which people learn to become law-abiding.</p>

<p>To be sure, the difference is more than rhetorical. Focusing on desistance instead of recidivism leads justice systems to reorient their operations and their measurement of success. A desistance framework encourages justice agencies to promote and monitor positive outcomes.</p>

<p>The Next To Die </p>

<p>For example, when a person previously convicted of a violent crime is later convicted of theft, it represents an incidence of recidivism. However, it could also indicate desistance, a step away from crime. The same could be said of the burglar who’s arrested five times in one year but only arrested once the following year.</p>

<p>Despite promising research on the potential for desistance-focused approaches to improve outcomes, community corrections agencies continue to rely on recidivism as the primary measure of their effectiveness.</p>

<p>But if justice systems are to be truly correctional, policymakers should begin to hold them to more rigorous standards, including asking systems to measure what they promise to produce and not merely what they try to avoid. This would aid policymakers in ensuring that they are getting the most from limited resources.</p>

<p>If we required our justice system to support the process of success instead of tracking single instances of failure, we just might be more effective at reducing crime and improving public safety.</p>

<p>Jabbar Collins languished in jail for over 16 years for a murder he apparently never committed. He was only freed a few years ago when it was revealed at a post-conviction hearing that the main witness at his trial had told the prosecutor that he was pressured by police to lie about Collins’ involvement in the murder.</p>

<p>The prosecutor, representing the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office, never shared that information with Collins’ lawyer—an egregious violation of the law, which requires the government to inform the defense of any exculpatory evidence. At the hearing, the judge who tossed out Collins’ conviction called the conduct of the prosecutor and the DA’s office “shameful” and a “tragedy.”</p>

<p>Jabbar Collins, who spent 16 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, reached a $10 million settlement with New York City.</p>

<p>Andrew Burton, special to ProPublica</p>

<p>I have been a federal district judge for the past 23 years sitting in the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse. I have sentenced murderers, rapists, gangsters, drug lords, stock cheats, and just about every other type of criminal, but they were all clearly guilty of their crimes and I was able to sleep at night knowing that they deserved to be sitting in jail—some for the rest of their lives. I do lose sleep, however, over the Collins case and the rash of wrongful convictions that are continuing to be uncovered to this date in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>The Collins case turned out to be the tip of the iceberg. Soon many other wrongful convictions, orchestrated by other Brooklyn prosecutors, began to surface. It became a huge scandal and a black mark against the criminal justice system in Brooklyn. It also animated a crusading civil rights lawyer named Ken Thompson to campaign against and defeat a 20-plus-year incumbent, making Thompson the first African-American district attorney in Brooklyn’s history.</p>

<p>When Thompson took over a few years ago, he appointed a blue-ribbon committee to investigate all the alleged wrongful convictions the DA’s office had obtained throughout the years. So far, over 20 cases have been unearthed—almost all against poor African Americans.Many others are still being investigated. The phony cases have run the gamut from prosecutors not turning over exculpatory evidence (as in Collins’ case), to using false testimony from the same supposed eye-witness in at least three unrelated cases.</p>

<p>After Collins was released, he brought a civil case seeking monetary damages against his prosecutor, the district attorney, and the City of New York. I was the judge who drew that case. I held that the City could be held liable for its misdeeds but I had to dismiss the case against the prosecutor and district attorney on the grounds of prosecutorial immunity. In my decision, I quoted the binding circuit court precedent I was duty-bound to follow.</p>

<p>According to Taylor v. Kavanagh, based upon Supreme Court law, “The falsification of evidence and the coercion of witnesses...have been held to be prosecutorial activities for which absolute immunity applies. Similarly, because a prosecutor is acting as an advocate in a judicial proceeding, the solicitation and subornation of perjured testimony, the withholding of evidence, or the introduction of illegally-seized evidence at trial does not create liability in damages.”</p>

<p>The law goes on to say that the rationale for this approach is “sound, for these protected activities, while deplorable, involve decisions of judgment affecting the course of a prosecution.”</p>

<p>I question the soundness of this rationale, however. The “solicitation and subornation of perjured testimony, the withholding of evidence, or the introduction of illegally-seized evidence at trial” are not “decisions of judgment;” they are truly “deplorable” intentional acts—the antithesis of the exercise of judgment. Professional prosecutors, charged with the awesome responsibility of faithfully applying the law to guard against innocent people being convicted of crimes they did not commit, should be held accountable for such conduct.</p>

<p>Case in Point </p>

<p>Because of the present status of the law, the prosecutors responsible for the wrongful convictions have neither been held criminally nor civilly responsible for their shameful conduct. Also troubling, taxpayers have had to foot the bill for millions of dollars in settlements from New York City and the State of New York, which are on the hook for the prosecutors’ misdeeds, and more are undoubtedly in the hopper. Collins settled his case for $13 million. Ron Kuby, the civil rights lawyer who represented a number of the wrongfully convicted in Brooklyn, recently told me that he believes the government has so far paid out between $300 million and $400 million.</p>

<p>And the problem of wrongful convictions is not endemic to Brooklyn. For example, just a few years ago Senator Ted Stevens’ conviction was overturned because of egregious behavior by two overzealous prosecutors for the Justice Department. And there have been many recently reported in other parts of the country.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the time has come to create some level of accountability for prosecutors.</p>

<p>First, the cloak of absolute immunity should judicially or legislatively be lifted. Police officers do not have it and they are held accountable in courts of law for their egregious behavior. We wisely do not give our law enforcement officers, or even the President, carte blanche to do as they please; bad prosecutors should similarly be accountable.</p>

<p>Second, steps can be taken by the legal establishment to punish such behavior. All prosecutors are lawyers and their licenses to practice law require them to abide by legally prescribed canons of ethics enforceable by the bar and the courts. Admirably, just a few months ago, the Indiana Supreme Court suspended the chief deputy prosecutor of LaPorte County, Indiana from the practice of law for a minimum of four years with no automatic right of reinstatement for eavesdropping on an attorney-client conversation. As in Collins’ case, the court described this conduct as “deplorable.” Other states should follow this lead.</p>

<p>Third, prosecutors who intentionally withhold exculpatory evidence resulting in a wrongful conviction should be prosecuted for obstruction of justice. The good ones need not be concerned, but the bad “deplorable” ones should know that there might be civil, and even criminal, consequences for misconduct.</p>

<p>We all hold dear to the time-honored notion that “no one is above the law.” Truly horrendous prosecutors who have put innocent people in jail should not be an exception.</p>

<p>Frederic Block is a federal district judge for the Eastern District of New York. In 2012 he published his memoir Disrobed, An Inside Look at the Life and Work of a Federal Trial Judge. His “reality-fiction” novel Race to Judgment was recently released based in part on the rise of Ken Thompson, the Collins case, and the wrongfully convicted.</p>

<p>How does a police department respond to a city in crisis?</p>

<p>In 2014, Flint, Michigan switched its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in a bid to save money, but toxic levels of lead leached into the city’s tap water. A year later, the city elected a new mayor who in turn hired a new police chief. Tim Johnson arrived at the job facing a funding and personnel shortage in a city that is the ninth most violent in America.</p>

<p>Under these conditions, Jessica Dimmock, Zackary Canepari and Drea Cooper began filming the city’s police department for “Flint Town,” a new eight-episode series on Netflix. The show provides a rare insight into a how lack of resources puts a further strain on the already tense relationship between the police department and the community it serves.</p>

<p>Over 20 months, Canepari, Cooper and Dimmock documented the struggles of the department and its officers against the backdrop of the 2016 presidential election and a series of police-involved shootings that rocked the country.</p>

<p>In the series’ third episode, the filmmakers captured the officers’ reactions in July 2016 as they watched a video during roll call of Philando Castile dying after being shot by a cop in Minnesota. One of the Flint officers questions why Castile’s girlfriend would film him as he moaned in pain. Another argues that the officer who shot Castile was reacting in fear by continuing to point the gun at an incapacitated man, screaming at him. Many agreed that the Minnesota officer would be crucified by the press and the public in the coming days.</p>

<p>We see the officers examining themselves and their role in the community while laying bare their biases. The scene and the series as a whole shows police officers struggling not only with limited resources and a fraught relationship with city residents but also with their own conceptions of what it means to police a community.</p>

<p>The Next To Die </p>

<p>Over the past 10 years, budget cuts have reduced Flint’s police force from about 300 officers to 98 serving 100,000 residents. As a consequence, officers cannot answer non-urgent 911 calls in a timely manner. In the first episode of the series, Officer Bridgette Balsko arrives 27 hours after a call is made reporting a robbery and assault. While 27 hours is an extreme example, the average response time approaches an hour. Though the department has tried several ways of reducing the response time, including taking reports over the phone, training and hiring a volunteer police force, and installing an intel center run by civilian employees, the department remains overwhelmed. “How can you trust the police when you can’t rely on them to help when you need them?” asks Cooper.</p>

<p>The filmmakers interview a resident who refuses to vote in favor of providing more funds to the police department, because he feels that Flint officers pull over and arrest too many people for petty crimes.</p>

<p>Capt. Devon Bernritter acknowledges the rift between officers and community members after he pulls over an African-American woman who nervously lies about her name. “It might be that the relationship that she personally has or her neighbor has or her family has somehow led her to the point where she feels like she can’t trust the police. She had no reason to lie other than she drove the wrong way on a one-way,” Bernritter says to the camera.</p>

<p>Brian Willingham, a Flint police officer and pastor, tries to reconcile the concerns of his cash-strapped department with his desire to serve the community. He asks: “How am I bettering the community by writing a person that already has multiple warrants more tickets that they can’t pay? The decisions you make as a cop have a ripple effect on the real life of people.”</p>

<h2 id="guantnamoforever">Guantánamo, Forever</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-02-27</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/02/28/guantanamo-forever </p>

<p>A recreation cage in the prison camp at Guantánamo Bay.</p>

<p>he message came in on a spring day via the undisclosed U.S. government facility that approves all correspondence out of the military prison in Guantánamo Bay. It was a request for representation from Haroon Gul, a detainee, to Shelby Sullivan-Bennis, an attorney. Gul had never had a lawyer. He was one of the last men in Guantánamo without one.</p>

<p>Now, in 2016, his request was urgent. After nearly a decade of nothing, he was being given the chance to explain himself. It would happen through the Periodic Review Board, an administrative body that considers whether Guantánamo prisoners who have not been charged should be transferred home or to another country. A board representative wrote Sullivan-Bennis an email explaining that Gul, also identified as detainee number ISN 3148, “has requested in writing that you assist him with … proceedings before the PRB, at no cost to the Government.” When the email arrived, Gul’s first hearing was weeks away.</p>

<p>Guantánamo lawyers are famously overworked. At the time, Sullivan-Bennis was juggling five other clients. She and her coworkers at the human rights organization Reprieve asked themselves: How can we possibly handle another one? “And then everyone was like, ‘Let’s just try,’” Sullivan-Bennis recalled. “Because otherwise he’ll be alone.’”</p>

<p>She typed Gul a brief note saying that she’d take his case and that she’d come see him soon. She asked if he wanted anything from Guantánamo’s all-purpose department store, the Navy Exchange.</p>

<p>Haroon Gul has been detained in Guantánamo since 2007.</p>

<p>“Dear Honorable Miss Shelby Sullivan Bennis,” he wrote back in sloping, cursive handwriting, “I have no words to express my feeling of gratitude, appreciation and Thanks for your timly legal and moral help in my PRB hearing. I was in a helpless and hopeless state of my mind in my legal affairs you gave me emotional psycholgcal help.”</p>

<p>A few weeks later, they met for the first time in a windowless cement cellblock on prison grounds. Gul sat across a plastic-top table from Sullivan-Bennis in a loose-fitting, tan-colored T-shirt, with his ankle shackled to a metal ring secured to the floor. He’d been detained in Guantánamo since 2007, shortly after Afghan National Directorate of Security forces burst with guns into the rural guesthouse where he was staying outside Jalalabad and threw a bag over his head.</p>

<p>For the first time, he told his story to a lawyer. He was in his early 30s, like her. He had a wife, Halimah, and a 10-year-old daughter, Maryam, living in a refugee camp in Pakistan. Gul himself grew up in a Pakistani camp after violence forced his family to flee his home in Afghanistan. Despite harsh camp conditions, he’d earned an economics degree at Hayatabad Science University. He spoke four languages, including Pashto and Dari. While at Guantánamo he’d learned a fifth, English.</p>

<p>Listen to an audio version of this story:</p>

<p>And like nearly every other detainee held at Guantánamo since 9/11, Gul had never been charged with a crime. The U.S. government was justifying his detainment under the law of war. In a secret government dossier on Gul released by Wikileaks, Gul (also known as Haroon al-Afghani) is described as “high risk” and of “high intelligence value.” The dossier alleges that he was an explosives expert and a high-ranking military strategist that had executed attacks on the Northern Alliance on behalf of Hezb-e Islami Gulbuddin, or HIG, a party affiliated with al Qaeda in the 2000s. U.S. intel also indicates that, in 2001, Gul attempted to help Osama bin Laden escape from Tora Bora.</p>

<p>Gul was too polite to put it this way, but he was effectively saying that it was all, all of it, bullshit. His affiliation with HIG was the same as that of millions of other Afghans: The group ran the refugee camps he needed to survive. He said he supported his family by selling small goods, like used books and jars of honey. He said the reason he was in that guesthouse that night was because he was on the road, selling, trying to scrape together some money. He said the Afghans had grabbed the wrong person.</p>

<p>The government’s allegations were built on secret interrogations and unidentified sources named things like IZ-10026. Sullivan-Bennis came to believe that Gul was innocent. It had happened before: An alleged al Qaeda agent named Mustafa al-Aziz al-Shamiri was detained for 13 years before his release; during his PRB hearing, the government admitted it may have had the wrong man.</p>

<p>The PRB process, though, is not about guilt or innocence. It’s akin to a parole hearing: Are you ready to repent? One of Sullivan-Bennis’s supervising attorneys had called it “having to roll over and show them your tummy.” Gul believed he had committed no crimes for which to repent. But he wouldn’t be the first to be granted freedom through the review board by expressing remorse for things he’d never done.</p>

<p>Thomas Wilner is one of the lawyers who won the two landmark Supreme Court cases that established habeas corpus rights for Guantánamo detainees. The PRB process “is not based on evidence,” he told me. “You have to be contrite. What do you tell a client who wants to go, ‘Fuck you! I’m innocent!’”</p>

<p>That first meeting between Gul and Sullivan-Bennis would come just four days before the PRB convened. Then came the hearing.</p>

<p>Shelby Sullivan-Bennis, an attorney with the human rights organization Reprieve, took on Haroon Gul's case in 2016. Greg Kahn for The Marshall Project</p>

<p>“So he sits in this white room with oddly comfortable chairs that the detainees have never been allowed to sit in before,” Sullivan-Bennis recalled. “They prop him up at the head of the table, and he sinks into this enormous beige puffy chair and he faces this enormous screen.” On the giant screen were the floating heads of a six-member board representing the Department of Justice and the other federal agencies that weigh in on the clearance process for Guantánamo. “And then, essentially, it’s an interrogation.”</p>

<p>Later, Sullivan-Bennis would identify all manner of reasons why the hearing didn’t break their way. But in her view it all came down to prep—they just didn’t have enough time.</p>

<p>“In making this determination,” the official ruling read, “the Board considered the detainee’s … failure to acknowledge or accept responsibility for past activities. The Board welcomes seeing the detainee’s file in six months with greater candor.”</p>

<p>So Gul was not recommended for transfer. But it was OK. Much higher profile Guantánamo detainees had been released through the PRB. That included Mohamedou Ould Slahi, who’d been implicated both in recruiting three of the 9/11 hijackers and in planning the foiled “Millennium Plot” to detonate explosives at LAX. In all, 36 detainees have been cleared and released through the review board. At least seven of those had not been granted a transfer after their first hearing before eventually winning their freedom.</p>

<p>Toward the end of President Obama’s second term, he had greatly accelerated the process of clearing out Guantánamo. By the end of the Bush administration the detainee population was 245; by the end of the Obama administration, it was 41. As president, Hillary Clinton would likely have been as eager to cut these last men loose: Before leaving her post as secretary of state, in January 2013, Clinton had sent Obama a forceful and detailed memo urging him to shutter the prison for good.</p>

<p>The detainees refer to securing a transfer as “getting your paper.” In the late summer of 2016, there was real reason to hope that Gul would get his. He’d be prepared, properly prepared, for the next PRB hearing. Gul finally, finally, had a lawyer.</p>

<p>here are two prison camps left at Guantánamo. Camp 7 houses 15 high-profile detainees, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the infamous KSM, the alleged “architect of 9/11.” The detainees engaged in military tribunals through the OMC, the Office of Military Commissions, are housed in Camp 7. Slowly, very slowly, legal cases against them are moving forward. And perhaps it’s counterintuitive because of the extremity of their alleged crimes, but they actually have large and extremely competent legal teams behind them, made up of a combination of civilian and JAG attorneys.</p>

<p>Gul is in Camp 6, with the 20 or so other non–high-profile detainees. The allegations against the detainees here are murky or relatively minor or, often enough, both. If their cases had been brought through the federal court system in the United States, they might well have been tried and—convicted or not—released by now. But because of their relatively lesser status, they’re left alone. The OMC system is deeply flawed, defense attorneys and legal experts say. But KSM is still moving toward some form of justice. Someone like Gul—a nobody—had no reason to believe he’d ever be afforded a reckoning.</p>

<p>But he tried. There are two detainees at Guantánamo who have chosen not to engage with the American legal system, according to Reprieve, and had never had representation. Gul was the last detainee to seek a lawyer and not have one.</p>

<p>A prison guard outside of Camp 6 at Guantánamo Bay. Under the government's ground rules, no identifiable faces of guards can be shown.</p>

<p>The exact reasons as to why Gul went so long without representation are messy and rife with the surreality that has come to define Guantánamo. According to Sullivan-Bennis, for a while, prison guards didn’t give Gul access to the official blue envelopes required for all legal correspondence. Their reasoning was that Gul didn’t have an active legal case, so why would he need the blue envelopes? In effect, Gul was being told, once you have a lawyer, you can seek out a lawyer.</p>

<p>Gul eventually managed to get word out to the network of attorneys who take on this kind of work, a tight-knit group informally known as the “GTMO bar.” Some never responded. Some wrote back to say they just couldn’t take on more clients.</p>

<p>For his first three years in Guantánamo, Gul only interacted with prison guards and detainees. In 2010, he was allowed to get a letter out to his family through the International Committee of the Red Cross. He wrote, “I am in Gitmo. Pray for me … I am OK.” Since, he’s been allowed one glitchy, heavily censored phone call every four to six weeks.</p>

<p>Working Gul’s case required long hours in Guantánamo, in those claustrophobic cement rooms. Pretty quickly, Sullivan-Bennis became someone he could talk to. About anything.</p>

<p>He felt his tragedy was grand, for sure. Gul said he suffered physical trauma. As Reprieve would write, after his arrest, he was “blindfolded, shackled, and hung by his arms while they were still cuffed behind his back, stripped and tortured.” Once at Guantánamo, Reprieve said, his interrogators “denied him access to bathroom facilities,” “lowered the thermostat to freezing,” and shackled him for up to 12 hours at a time “without water or food in a position that allowed him neither to fully stand nor sit, preventing any sleep.”</p>

<p>But like anyone, in or out of indefinite detention, he was obsessed with the minor indignities of his life, too. Slights from guards. Uncomfortable living conditions. “He’d never had anyone to talk to about this injustice or that one,” said Sullivan-Bennis. “His detention is the overarching one—but there are hundreds beneath that.”</p>

<p>And really, he just loved to chat. He’d talk about Afghan politics, which Sullivan-Bennis couldn’t engage him much on, and American politics, which she happily could. During the 2016 primaries, Gul watched a lot of the lefty news channel Democracy Now! He told Sullivan-Bennis, “Bernie is concerned with the people!” One day Sullivan-Bennis got a memo from the team that reviews detainee correspondence. “It said, ‘Your client has written a letter to someone besides yourself. And then at the bottom of the memo it said, ‘That person was Bernie Sanders.’”</p>

<p>Most of Sullivan-Bennis’s clients were older than her, some by decades. They were proper, careful, reserved. Gul was a bit of a ballbuster. He’d laugh that they were both too young to know anything. Once, he picked up that Sullivan-Bennis was in a bad mood and riffed: “It’s OK! It’s Guantánamo! It makes everyone feel like they’re at war!”</p>

<p>As they got to know each other, Sullivan-Bennis pushed forward on another front—Gul’s habeas corpus case in the federal court system in D.C. Habeas corpus establishes that a detainee cannot be held indefinitely without grounds.</p>

<p>For Reprieve, this represented the crux of the injustice of his detention. Say Gul had been a high-level HIG operative. Wasn’t it long past time for the government to prove as much in court? Also, in the years since, the Afghan government had actually reached a peace deal with HIG. They were now a legally recognized political party running candidates for office. And besides: Obama had declared the war in Afghanistan over in 2014. So why were we still holding war prisoners?</p>

<p>But Sullivan-Bennis said she hit a wall putting Gul’s case together: The U.S. government wasn’t cooperating. Of the thousands of documents that purportedly made up the case against Gul, only 24 pages had at first been declassified and turned over. As Sullivan-Bennis explained, “It sounds insane, but it’s not at all automatic that, if you’re imprisoned in Guantánamo, you know why.”</p>

<p>n November 2016, Donald Trump was elected president. A month or so after, the ramifications of the shock victory not yet settled, I spoke with Sullivan-Bennis. On the campaign trail Trump had promised to keep Guantánamo open and to load it up with “bad dudes”; he’d also promoted torture of wartime detainees like Gul. “Frankly, we’re hopeful,” she said, “and we’re terrified.”</p>

<p>Gul fell into a pit. “He’s said to me so many times, ‘Shelby, I can’t wait another year. I should go home. I should be at home,’” Sullivan-Bennis said. Gul would express concern for his daughter’s education. When she was able to study, she was an excellent student, regularly one of the best in her class. She loved it so much, Gul explained, that she’d even inspired her mother to go back to school. But life in the refugee camps could be unstable. And in those times, Sullivan-Bennis said, Gul would “repeat over and over, ‘She hasn’t been able to get to school. She hasn’t been able to get to school.’”</p>

<p>A copy of a letter written by Haroon Gul to his lawyer, Shelby Sullivan-Bennis, and a drawing he made of his daughter, Maryam.</p>

<p>In the early months of 2017, Gul and Sullivan-Bennis prepped carefully for Gul’s second PRB hearing. They worked on explaining, in as detailed and direct a manner as possible, Gul’s life before Guantánamo. Gul was prone to circular answers. Sullivan-Bennis drilled him as if she was preparing a client for cross examination. “No,” she would tell him, good-naturedly pushing back as he rambled, “that’s not exactly it.”</p>

<p>They also worked on explaining what his life after would be like. Gul had charted out a business plan for a honeybee farm that he would run in coordination with a local university in Pakistan. Agricultural students would be employed on the farm in a work-study capacity. There’d be a bakery on site, too.</p>

<p>In regard to the extremist ideology of al Qaeda that had purportedly got him locked up in the first place, Gul knew what he would say. It does not comport with his belief system. Al Qaeda oppresses women. He wants schooling for his wife and daughter.</p>

<p>One question was still present: contrition. Gul and Sullivan-Bennis knew the board was looking for repentance. Gul had never wavered from his claim of innocence. And so he had never before raised the possibility of asking for forgiveness. But this was now his second go-around. Post-Trump, perhaps he’d be more desperate than ever. Willing to compromise his truth.</p>

<p>Sullivan-Bennis waited for him to make his decision. “I would never counsel him to lie,” she said. “But I think the detainees should be given the tools to make those decisions for themselves.”</p>

<p>In March, Gul had his hearing. Once again he was trotted into the white room and plopped into the oddly comfortable beige chair. Once again he faced the floating heads on the screen. Once again he made his case for release.</p>

<p>“He answered everything quickly and directly,” Sullivan-Bennis reported back at the time. “We presented the business plans. I think he was great. I think he did really well.”</p>

<p>Gul knew men that had gotten out by throwing themselves at the mercy of the review board. But even then, years into his detention—and with a shred of hope finally in grasp—he didn’t budge. He didn’t apologize. Sullivan-Bennis said, “I don’t think he would ever consider it.”</p>

<p>ViewFinder </p>

<p>n April 2017, while on prison camp grounds in Guantánamo, Sullivan-Bennis ran into a government interpreter she knew. She heard, “‘Oh, I think they’re giving Haroon his Final Determination today.’ And I was like, ‘What?!’”</p>

<p>The Final Determination was the government’s response to Gul’s second review board hearing. Per protocol, Gul and Sullivan-Bennis should have been notified it was coming down. No such notification occurred, Sullivan-Bennis said. “I just happened to be physically present at the camp at that particular moment in the morning,” she said, “and I just, like, barged into the meeting.”</p>

<p>It was the same kind of windowless cement room where Sullivan-Bennis and Gul always had their meetings. Gul was on one side of the plastic-top table. Sullivan-Bennis, an interpreter, and a military representative sat on the other.</p>

<p>The military rep read a brief statement: “The Periodic Review Board, by consensus, determined that continued law of war detention of the detainee remains necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States.”</p>

<p>Gul listened and stayed silent. The representative asked if Gul had any questions. Gul said no. “And he just looked at me,” Sullivan-Bennis recalled. “And I said, ‘I’m sorry.’ And he said, ‘It’s OK. It doesn’t matter.’ And I said, ‘Yes it does.’”</p>

<p>That afternoon, Sullivan-Bennis and Gul met one-on-one. “He’s not a defeatist person,” she said. “But for four hours he told me he was giving up on his life.” Gul wasn’t done seeking legal recourse. He was was done with it all. “He was saying he wanted to give up on his family,” Sullivan-Bennis explained. “He was saying he was giving them false hope. He wanted to let them go and continue their lives.”</p>

<p>Then he apologized. “He said, ‘I’m sorry you have to suffer me.’” Mustering some deep reserves of enthusiasm, Sullivan-Bennis tried to push back. She told him, “This doesn’t mean the end of everything.”</p>

<p>Immediately after Trump’s election, no one actually knew what he would do with Guantánamo or its “forever prisoners.” Months in, it seemed his administration was taking the path of least resistance.</p>

<p>In an email, Pentagon spokesperson Air Force Major Ben Sakrisson confirmed the facts: “Since January 2017, no PRBs resulted in a transfer decision.” Furthermore, five men who had been cleared for transfer by the Obama administration were not being released. The Pentagon did not reply to queries about Gul’s case.</p>

<p>A few months ago, when it became clearer what was happening at Guantánamo, I spoke to Wilner, the Supreme Court lawyer who had won habeas rights for detainees. “Obama was not being honest about his commitment to ending this,” he told me, fuming. “I think, in the back of his mind, he liked the idea that he could keep people except those he wanted to release.”</p>

<p>Frustrated, horrified, he unleashed a bellow somewhere in the direction of the former president: “You left it in Trump’s hands, and now the poor bastards are stuck there! You’re leaving Donald Trump a lawless prison!”</p>

<p>n the fall of 2017, I visited Guantánamo Bay. I sat in on hearings in the Expeditionary Legal Complex. It’s a war court, prefab, plopped in the middle of a disused tarmac. That week, the ELC was holding pretrial hearings in the 9/11 trial, the Office of Military Commission case against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and the four other detainees charged with conspiring to execute the attacks.</p>

<p>In an infamous photo of KSM from the night of his capture, he looks wild and disheveled and dazed, but also imposing somehow—a menace, a threat. In person, escorted into court by two soldiers in fatigues and blue plastic gloves, in a camo jacket over a white robe, he looked shrunken.</p>

<p>I sat in the back of the courtroom in a viewing gallery separated, with respect to the preservation of classified information, by three panes of soundproof glass and a 40-second audio delay. Little placards posted throughout the room listed rules. Nᴏ ᴅʀᴀᴡɪɴɢ, ᴅᴏᴏᴅʟɪɴɢ, ꜱᴋᴇᴛᴄʜɪɴɢ. Nᴏ ʙɪɴᴏᴄᴜʟᴀʀꜱ.</p>

<p>The defense pushed for discovery. One defense lawyer wanted all information about CIA torture sites, down to the actual building materials. She wanted to know what kind of wall it was that her client’s head had been slammed into over and over again. She wanted to know weather conditions and smell—“smell in the context of torture can be important.”</p>

<p>Another defense lawyer charted out a long list of witnesses he’d like to call over the question of war hostilities. They were major names from a former era. Paul Wolfowitz. Condoleezza Rice. Colin Powell. Donald Rumsfeld. At some point during his presentation, lead prosecutor Brigadier General Mark Martins stood at his desk, hunched over his microphone, and announced, “I’m invoking national security privilege.”</p>

<p>Something had been deemed to be potentially classified. The court gallery was cleared. While it was sorted, we went outside and baked in the Cuban sun near vending machines stocked with Pepsi and Andy Capps’ Hot Fries. We watched a woman feed chocolate to a long, lone iguana. A soldier standing guard behind us clucked, worried about the gastrointestinal impact. That iguana, he told us, was going to have a “bad time.”</p>

<p>Everyone on both sides was muddling forward together, hoping to instill the process with legitimacy. But there was no precedent here. It was hard to ignore the overarching fact: all these years later, and the case was still in pretrial hearings. Everything was trivial. Everything was huge.</p>

<p>And yet, there was something to be said for the sheer existence of the proceedings. Some semblance of jurisprudence was lurching along.</p>

<p>Haroon Gul is in Camp 6, with the 20 or so other non–high-profile detainees.</p>

<p>As for Gul’s case, Sullivan-Bennis is still engaged in the habeas process. A year and a half after Reprieve took him on as a client, she said she is still struggling with basic discovery. For one, she said the government had conducted extensive searches but could not find any transcripts of Gul’s many interrogations. The Justice Department declined to comment, citing active litigation.</p>

<p>In January, hoping to bring renewed attention to their indefinite detention, 11 of Gul’s fellow “forever prisoners” filed new habeas petitions in the U.S. District Court in D.C. The motions, which Sullivan-Bennis called “kind of like a class-action lawsuit for GTMO detainees,” were filed simultaneously at 8:30 a.m. on January 11, the 16th anniversary of the opening of the prison. Reprieve was involved in the action, but out of concern that a new petition might hurt his case, Gul was not.</p>

<p>Days later, Trump announced during his State of the Union address that he had signed an executive order to “keep open the detention facilities at Guantánamo Bay,” officially reversing an Obama-era order to shut down the prison.</p>

<p>As a government cable leaked a few days earlier made clear, “The E.O. does not signal a significant policy shift with respect to detentions. Rather, it affirms Guantánamo Bay will continue to … serve as one of several options the United States maintains for the detention of terrorists.” Both sides were making noise. The status quo, however, was not being threatened.</p>

<p>“I’m relieved, to be honest,” Sullivan-Bennis said of Trump’s order, adding that she and other lawyers in the GTMO bar had expected worse. They’d imagined that Trump might explicitly ban the possibility of detainees being transferred out. “Officially, at least, they still have an avenue for release. Whether or not we’re ever going to see this happen is another question.”</p>

<p>When I first began communicating with Sullivan-Bennis, a month before the 2016 election, I did so believing I was tracking the process of getting a man released from Guantánamo. But for now, Trump, it seems, has shut the doors.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to see Gul while I was in Guantánamo. Press are not granted communication with detainees. He was a few miles away—exact location, undisclosed—in Camp 6. He’d been there for years. Surely, now, he’d be there for years to come.</p>

<p>And yet, Gul still talks about the future. He’s written to Sullivan-Bennis, “I am working on some projects to make my life after Gitmo better. I am still thinking about my wife and daughter.” What else can he do?</p>

<p>Sullivan-Bennis had instructed Gul to stop engaging with the Periodic Review Board. She could no longer force optimism. “I would be hugely surprised if anyone left Guantánamo in the next four years,” she told me. “But I don’t like to say it out loud.”</p>

<p>In 1963, when Henry Montgomery was 17 years old, he killed a sheriff’s deputy in East Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Montgomery was sentenced to life without parole for his crime. Now 71 years old, he has been incarcerated for 54 years. Montgomery is also the named plaintiff in a 2016 landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling that applied retroactively the Court’s 2012 precedent banning mandatory life without parole sentences for youth who committed their offense under the age of 18. The decision was the third in a series that required states to give Montgomery and 2,000 other people serving life without parole a “meaningful opportunity for release.”</p>

<p>Despite being newly eligible for parole because of his resentencing, last week the Louisiana Board of Parole turned down Montgomery’s application for release. As justification, members of the board cited Montgomery’s short list of official classes completed during his time in prison. It didn’t acknowledge, however, that he was excluded from such programming for the first 30 years of his sentence because of his life sentence.</p>

<p>Henry Montgomery, flanked by two deputies, awaits the verdict in his 1964 trial for the murder of Deputy Sheriff Charles H. Hurt in Louisiana.</p>

<p>John Boss/The Advocate</p>

<p>Montgomery’s case offers a window into the experience of life imprisonment nationally, one that is particularly distorted for those sentenced to prison as teenagers. Some correctional policies limit participation in programming to those with an upcoming release date, which places those serving life at an extreme disadvantage. Even if eligible, programs frequently have long wait lists and those with life terms are at the back of the line. As in Montgomery’s situation, if a prisoner is restricted from accessing programming he or she has a difficult time making an argument for rehabilitation before a parole board.</p>

<p>Though painted as such by the state, Montgomery was hardly a do-nothing. For 20 years, he worked full time in the prison’s silk-screen shop, where he was named “Employee of the Month” eight times. He also founded Angola’s Amateur Boxing Association and engaged in religious groups within the prison. For a period, Alcoholics Anonymous was the only available self-help group in the prison and, even though Montgomery had no history of alcoholism, he participated in the group meetings because they were all that was offered.</p>

<p>In the past, people with life terms were able to work toward meaningful correctional privileges, and while lifers never had an opportunity for broad exposure to programming, fiscal constraints and regressive crime policies have restricted these options even more.</p>

<p>Become a Member </p>

<p>In 2012, I conducted a national study of individuals sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes committed as juveniles; it revealed that many lifers were denied access to rehabilitative programming. For example, half of the Michigan prisoners serving juvenile life without parole sentences reported that they did not participate in programming because their sentence precluded it, and another quarter had already exhausted program offerings. Similar trends existed in Pennsylvania and Florida.</p>

<p>Given Montgomery’s precedent-setting advocacy at the Supreme Court, his parole outcome is troubling and may set a less welcome precedent for many others seeking relief. Recent data show that while there were fewer prisoners serving a sentence of juvenile life without parole in 2016 than in 2012, the vast majority of those who are supposed to benefit from these landmark rulings are still waiting.</p>

<p>If Henry Montgomery’s situation is any indication of how the Court’s ruling will continue to play out across the country, it’s a sad commentary on the meaning of justice today.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1967, more than 150 cities erupted into violence, fueled by pent-up resentments in the cities’ black communities over police brutality and other forms of racial injustice. News networks broadcast the unrest around the country, and as the cities burned, many Americans watched in shock and horror.</p>

<p>President Lyndon B. Johnson responded by organizing a commission, comprised of lawmakers and law enforcement officials from around the country, to understand what caused the violence that left scores of people dead and caused millions of dollars in damages. The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders — more commonly known as the Kerner commission after its chairman, Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner, Jr. — released its recommendations on Feb. 29, 1968. Today, 50 years later, the commission’s findings, that “the nation is moving toward two societies, one black and one white — separate and unequal,” still ring true.</p>

<p>From left, Roy Wilkins, Gov. Otto Kerner of Illinois, and President Lyndon B. Johnson in July, 1967.</p>

<p>But just as the report laid bare the inequality experienced by black Americans in urban areas and attempted to paint police brutality as a main cause of the uprisings, the Johnson administration doubled down on a law-and-order agenda. The president, still expected to run for re-election later that year, was driven by the fear that white voters would not sympathize with the commission’s findings. Crime was rising in many cities, but the commission urged the federal government to invest heavily in programs aimed at improving the lives of the cities’ black populations.</p>

<p>What’s more, the violence provided the support lawmakers needed to shift from the War on Poverty to the War on Crime, which funneled millions of dollars of federal resources to local police departments and undermined local efforts to address the racialized policing practices that had set entire cities on fire. In the wake of the violence, two seperate and opposing movements formed. While the black community pushed for police reform alongside socioeconomic improvement, the federal government responded by equipping police with new tools to control violent expressions of civil unrest.</p>

<p>Some historians see the commission as a missed opportunity to broach a national conversation on the role of police in black communities. Still others point out an important insight into the nature of police brutality — that poverty and segregation can foster police violence. A closer look at both the Kerner commission's findings and the ensuing fallout uncovers the tangled roots of protests in Ferguson, Mo., Baltimore, St. Paul, Minn., Baton Rouge, La., and Chicago in recent years.</p>

<p>n July 12, 1967, police officers in Newark, N.J., arrested a black cab driver named Sam Smith for tailgating and allegedly driving the wrong way down a one-way street. A bystander who witnessed the arrest told several civil rights leaders in the city that Smith had been assaulted by the police while being taken into custody. The community leaders visited Smith in jail, noted his injuries, and demanded he be transferred to a hospital.</p>

<p>The police granted the request, but word had already begun to spread through the black community that officers had brutalized Smith. Residents slowly gathered around the police station where Smith had been held. What began as a nonviolent gathering soon erupted into a riot.</p>

<p>Residents threw rocks, smashing the station’s windows. Officers unsuccessfully tried to disperse the swelling crowd. As the riot grew, some protestors lobbed Molotov cocktails, setting a car on fire, while others looted stores.</p>

<p>The violence enveloped the city, and local police were ineffective at quelling the rising chaos. Mayor Hugh Addonizio asked the governor to call in the National Guard.</p>

<p>By the afternoon, 3,000 National Guardsmen descended on the city, but the protests continued for several days.</p>

<p>When the uprising finally ended five days after Smith’s arrest, 26 people were dead, 750 were injured, and more than 1,000 had been thrown in jail.</p>

<p>A few days later, Detroit residents clashed with the city’s police during a raid of an after-hours club.</p>

<p>It began in the wee hours of July 23, 1967. It was a hot and humid night, and residents flocked to a party at the Blind Pig, an illegally-operated club on the corner of Clairmount Avenue and 12th Street in Detroit. The city’s vice squad raided the club, shutting it down, but patrons would not leave. Outside, residents gathered to watch the commotion. The police began slowly hauling clubgoers away, and by the time they placed the last one in the back of a squad car, a small crowd had gathered on the corner.</p>

<p>The crowd began throwing bottles, sending one crashing through the window of a police car. The commotion drew thousands out of their homes and into the streets, and by dawn a full-blown riot was underway. People set buildings on fire, fought with the police and firemen who responded to calls for backup, and looted storefronts. The riot swelled and spread until the city was enveloped in flames.</p>

<p>The rioting raged for five days, prompting Mayor Jerome P. Cavanaugh to call in the National Guard. When the ashes settled, 43 people were dead, thousands more were injured, and nearly 7,000 people were arrested. The 12th Street riot was one of the worst in U.S. history.</p>

<p>"[T]ell me if you feel it is a major cause of a breakdown of law and order, a minor cause, or hardly a cause at all... Negroes who start riots."</p>

<p>he riots in Newark and Detroit were not isolated incidents. Three years earlier, during the summer of 1964, black residents in Harlem, Chicago, Philadelphia and Jersey City, N.J., had taken to the streets to protest police brutality.</p>

<p>That same year, Lyndon B. Johnson ran a successful campaign for the presidency, declaring open war on poverty. But the riots threatened his vision for a Great Society defined by equal rights and opportunity. By 1965, Johnson had reworked his agenda, adding programs aimed at combating rising crime. One of the most notable shifts came in the form of the Law Enforcement Assistance Act, which Johnson signed into law in the fall of 1965.</p>

<p>“The Great Society we are striving to build cannot become a reality unless we strike at the roots of crime, and strike again until we have brought it under our control,” read Johnson’s statement following the signing of the bill.</p>

<p>The bill was signed against the backdrop of rising crime rates and increasing segregation in America’s cities. The riots accelerated the flight of white residents to the suburbs, just as the second Great Migration pushed more and more African-Americans into urban areas. The predominately white police forces in increasingly black cities further exacerbated racial tensions. By 1968, a public opinion poll found that 81 percent of the respondents believed law and order had broken down in America.</p>

<p>By the time the Kerner commission report landed on Johnson’s desk, the foundation for a renewed focus on suppressing violence had already been laid, and the Law Enforcement Assistance Act had given the federal government new influence over local police activities.</p>

<p>The Act established the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance, which later led to the Office of Justice Programs in the Department of Justice, and tasked it with funding the development of new crime control methods. For the first time, the federal government was directly involved in improving the quality of state and local law enforcement programs.</p>

<p>The first draft of the commission’s report was penned by a group of social scientists hired to synthesize weeks of hearings and scores of interviews with witnesses of the violence. But the commission balked at the scientists’ first draft, entitled, “The Harvest of American Racism.” It offered a searing indictment of white racism toward black Americans, implicating the police as both a symbol and enforcer of white power. The scientists asserted that racism was a direct cause of the violent rebellions and urged the federal government to take action to prevent more unrest.</p>

<p>The initial draft asserted that black Americans would no longer tolerate living as second-class citizens, declaring that, “a truly revolutionary spirit has begun to take hold,” that black Americans were unwilling “to compromise or wait any longer” and would rather “risk death than have their people continue in a subordinate status."</p>

<p>But the bipartisan commission balked at the draft and compelled the scientists to tone down their findings before submitting a report to the president. They ordered the initial draft destroyed, and the second version put segregation and economic inequality at the center, shying away from the previous criticisms of the police. Today, the original draft rests in the National Archives in Washington, D.C., the word “DESTROY,” emblazoned across the front page.</p>

<p>“For all the criticisms of the police and the recommendations for change outlined in the report, they pale in comparison to the evidence that was actually produced,” said University of Oklahoma historian and author Steven M. Gillon. “The final document is a watered-down version of the evidence that had been collected in the field about the role the police played in creating the riots and responding in a way that made the situation worse.”</p>

<p>Gillon is the author of the forthcoming book, “Separate and Unequal: The Kerner Commission and the Unraveling of American Liberalism,” which explores the history of the commission. Gillon says the leaders Johnson appointed took issue with the scientists’ declaration that the police were poorly trained and that many in the black community no longer respected law enforcement.</p>

<p>Still, former Oklahoma Sen. Fred Harris, a Democrat and the last surviving member of the commission, said the members had a clear vision for addressing the fractured relationship between the police and the black community.</p>

<p>“We thought the police ought to look like the people they are dealing with,” he told The Marshall Project on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the report. “We were against the militarization of the police. We thought that tanks and automatic weapons had no place in urban areas. We thought the police ought to enforce the law on behalf of the community.”</p>

<p>“The police are not merely a spark factor. To some Negroes police have come to symbolize white power, white racism, and white repression. And the fact is that many police do reflect and express these white attitudes. The atmosphere of hostility and cynicism is reinforced by a widespread belief among Negroes in the existence of police brutality and the double standard of justice and protection — one for Negroes and one for whites.” </p>

<p>– Report of The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders</p>

<p>But Johnson had another focus.</p>

<p>“Racialized policing was not on the agenda and not on the program,” said Heather Ann Thompson, a Pulitzer Prize winning historian and author, “Economic development, that was Lyndon Johnson's hobby horse, so the commission becomes a game of political football around economic injustice.”</p>

<p>Thompson, who wrote a book detailing Detroit’s upheaval in the 1960’s and 70’s entitled, “Whose Detroit,” notes that the commission’s directives to invest in the black community were subsumed by Johnson’s focus on eliminating poverty and controlling crime. At the same time, in response to the violence, local leaders intensified their calls for police reform.</p>

<p>“The community was asking for community policing and other reforms, but simultaneously the federal government is advocating for more aggressive policing,” Thompson said.</p>

<p>Mayoral races in cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, Newark, and Cleveland, where the black population had grown weary of living in substandard conditions with ineffective policing, exemplified the push for reform. In the years following the riots, several black candidates made their way onto the ballots, thanks to the support of the cities’ black populations.</p>

<p>Many of the black mayoral candidates were calling for the integration of the police forces and civilian review boards to address complaints against the police. But success was mixed at best.</p>

<p>Cleveland Mayor Carl B. Stokes campaigning for a second term in 1969.</p>

<p>Cleveland had elected its first black mayor, Carl B. Stokes, in 1967. Before becoming mayor, Stokes served two terms in the Ohio House of Representatives. He wanted the police to treat black residents the same as whites, to integrate the department, and to end unnecessary violence against black people.</p>

<p>While Stokes’ suggestions were based largely on witnessing the injustices carried out by the police, his agenda gained credence from the 1966 Little Hoover Commission report. The commission, under the direction of Stokes' predecessor, conducted an in-depth study of the city’s administration and recommended major changes to the police department. Ultimately, Stokes’ vision was undermined by internal scandals and the Glenville riot in 1968, which left three Cleveland policemen dead.</p>

<p>Philadelphia police Commissioner Frank Rizzo with weapons confiscated in a raid on black militant headquarters in 1970.</p>

<p>In Detroit and Philadelphia, the pendulum swung in the opposite direction, away from reform. Residents elected former law enforcement agents to govern the cities, a decision widely understood as a reaction to the summer of violent protest. Instead of reform, residents pushed for greater law and order. In Philadelphia, former police commissioner Frank Rizzo became mayor. And in Detroit, former Wayne County Sheriff Roman S. Gribbs beat the city’s first black candidate, Richard H. Austin.</p>

<p>Under Gribbs, the police department launched a controversial anti-crime unit called STRESS, short for Stop the Robberies - Enjoy Safe Streets, to quell the robberies and petty violence that had taken over many of Detroit's black neighborhoods. The city’s black residents protested the new unit’s tactics, saying they were too aggressive. By the time Detroit’s first black Mayor, Coleman Young ended the STRESS program in 1974, officers had killed 20 civilians, the majority of whom were black.</p>

<p>Change progressed in fits and starts at the local level. While cities were divided over how best to respond to the riots and reform police departments, the biggest blow to meaningful improvement came from the federal government.</p>

<p>The Kerner commission had called for investment into urban areas to create new jobs, improve education, hasten integration, and improve housing conditions. Even though their suggestions aligned with the Great Society’s mission, Johnson was threatened by the findings, fearing that he would lose public support, especially from the white community who were reluctant to accept the role of racism in the riots. As crime rose, many saw stronger policing as the only way to address the violence. Johnson abruptly disbanded the commission and never publicly thanked its members for their work.</p>

<p>Johnson’s abandonment of the commission’s vision is perhaps most apparent in his signing of the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968, nearly six months after the Kerner commission submitted its report. The new law authorized $400 million in grants to states to provide new equipment and technical assistance to local police forces. It also built on the 1965 Law Enforcement Assistance Act, which had paved the way for increased federal involvement in local policing. The new law made the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, which was initially established under the 1965 act, permanent.</p>

<p>The federal government was now in the business of providing direct support to local police departments in the form of research, better weapons, and surveillance. Much of their work focused on understanding the social aspects of crime and preventing further riots.</p>

<p>“Under the new legislation, the federal government financially encouraged states to acquire surplus M-1 military carbines, army tanks, bulletproof vests, and walkie-talkies for local police by covering up to 90 percent of the costs of the riot prevention programs,” wrote Harvard historian Elizabeth Hinton in an journal article entitled “A War within our Own Boundaries.”</p>

<p>"On the whole, do you think those disturbances (racial disturbances or riots in many big cities) helped or hurt the cause of black rights, or would you say they didn't make much difference?"</p>

<p>Source: The Roper Center for Public Opinion Research.</p>

<p>Hinton argues that Johnson’s Great Society programs coupled with his increasing focus on preventing violent uprisings in the black community, “laid the groundwork for contemporary mass incarceration.” What started as anti-poverty programs had morphed into programs to control violent crime.</p>

<p>The Kerner commission's findings are widely hailed as one of the most insightful and enduring analyses of racial and economic inequality in America. But the commission’s recommendations were largely ignored. In their place, Johnson and his successor, Richard Nixon, emphasized tough-on-crime law enforcement policies that would sweep up millions of black Americans into the criminal justice system, further fracturing the relationship between the police and the people they are sworn to protect.</p>

<p>A protest in Baltimore, in 2015. Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post, via Getty Images</p>

<p>hen residents of Ferguson took to the streets in 2014 after a police officer killed teenager Michael Brown, national media pointed back to the Kerner commission’s findings, noting that little had changed since 1968 with respect to economic inequality and police-community relations.</p>

<p>In the ensuing years, residents in Chicago, St. Paul, Baton Rouge, and Baltimore broke out in protest when black men died after run-ins with the police.</p>

<p>On the surface, the cause of the protests seemed clear. In many instances, protesters were responding to an incident of fatal police force, while the officers involved were either acquitted, not indicted or not charged. In contrast to the Kerner commission, investigations into the causes of the riots have tended to focus directly on the role of the police. In Ferguson, the Department of Justice concluded that years of racially biased police practices had created an atmosphere of tension and resentment between Ferguson’s black residents and the police force, which turned to rage and protest after Brown was killed. The department’s report on Ferguson’s police lays out a set of guidelines aimed at creating “meaningful and sustainable reform” within the department.</p>

<p>In response to the civil unrest, President Barack Obama convened the Task Force on 21st Century Policing. Just as Johnson had gathered the Kerner commission to find out the causes of the riots, Obama empowered his task force to gather community input on how to improve policing and mend the broken relationship between the police and the black community.</p>

<p>But unlike Kerner, Obama’s task force came back with a report that centers on reforms to police departments. There is little mention of the role of poverty and enduring economic inequality in creating crime and violence. For Malcolm Holmes, a sociologist at the University of Wyoming, whose work focuses on police brutality, the task force's findings are understandable, but misguided.</p>

<p>“We talk about changes in policing — they are important, but I don't think anything is going to change until we deal with these underlying issues of social inequality,” Holmes said.</p>

<p>Holmes argues that the Kerner commission's findings actually provide a framework for ending police violence. His research shows that black people living in disadvantaged neighborhoods with high segregation are at the highest risk of police violence, and that it is the environment that puts residents at risk. In neighborhoods with high segregation and poverty, the police are more likely to use excessive force, which he interprets as a reaction to fear, prejudice against the black community, and past experiences with community violence. Holmes says it’s one of the reasons reforms focused on sensitivity and diversity haven’t been effective.</p>

<p>“You can't put the police officers in a training seminar for a day and expect them to change their worldview,” he said. “It flies in the face of what they see on the job.”</p>

<p>Holmes’s theory helps to explain why the Justice Department found that police still unnecessarily used excessive force in Detroit in 2003 and in Newark in 2014 despite the fact that the departments had become increasingly diverse.</p>

<p>In 2015, the Department of Justice released a resource guide for local law enforcement designed to help police departments across the country implement the recommendations outlined by Obama's task force. The guidelines focus on steps departments can take to build trust and support, strengthen police oversight, promote officer safety, and make use of new crime-fighting technologies. But the the Justice Department under the Trump administration has backed away from the Obama-era reforms, and has routinely promoted its commitment to tough-on-crime policies.</p>

<p>For Harris, the author of a new book entitled, “Healing Our Divided Society: Investing in America 50 Years After the Kerner Report.” the original message of the commission is still just as important today as it was in 1968. It is racial and economic inequality, he insists, that drive both police violence and the subsequent community response.</p>

<p>“There is no way you can solve those problems with the police unless you get at these intertwined issues of race and poverty.”</p>

<h2 id="theprosecutors">👀 👀 👀 the Prosecutors</h2>

<p>by: Beth Schwartzapfel</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-25</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/02/26/the-prosecutors </p>

<p>After years of focusing efforts on private prisons, mandatory sentences and money bail, people trying to change the criminal justice system have identified another target: prosecutors. In an influential book last year, Fordham University professor John Pfaff argued prosecutors were the main driver behind the soaring U.S. incarceration rate — almost always unwatched and unopposed. Left-leaning philanthropist George Soros, among others, is recruiting and funding district attorney candidates who promise to curtail the use of the death penalty, expand diversion programs and stop prosecuting low-level crimes. There is even a new stab at a Progressive Prosecutor’s Handbook.</p>

<p>Still, what district attorneys say in public and what they and their staffers do in the courtroom could be worlds apart, and few might ever know. Legislators can be held accountable to a voting record, but much of what prosecutors do goes unrecorded. “A lot of the information we care about — how prosecutors use their extraordinary discretion — is not being captured in any way whatsoever,” said Udi Ofer, who runs the ACLU’s national effort to elect new prosecutors.</p>

<p>Enter local court watchers, groups that ask ordinary people to watch the daily machinery of the justice system and report back what they see. The latest offshoot, Court Watch NYC, launches Tuesday.</p>

<p>The newest group plans to keep close tabs on Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., who announced last month his office would no longer ask judges to set bail in low-level misdemeanor cases, and Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez, who said he implemented a similar policy in April.</p>

<p>In New York, the bail set by a judge is readily available online. The only way to determine other information, such as racial disparities in what bail DAs request or how prosecutors influence a judge’s decisions, is to sit there, says Alyssa Aguilera, an organizer with VOCAL-NY, a community group that helped establish Court Watch NYC.</p>

<p>“Today two people arraigned in Manhattan for dancing on the subway,” the group tweeted during a two-week pilot test this winter. And, “Last night in Brooklyn: DA asked for $1500 bail on someone accused of stealing 4 bars of SOAP.” One of their tweets includes Vance’s Twitter handle with a string of eyeball emojis.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Vance said the office could not track down the subway case without more specific identifiers, which Court Watch NYC did not have.</p>

<p>Organized by a group of public defenders along with VOCAL-NY and the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, Court Watch NYC sends pairs of volunteers to arraignment courts in Manhattan and Brooklyn, where defendants are formally charged and bail decisions are made. One watcher tracks data such as race, gender and criminal charges; the other records impressions and anecdotes: “judge condescending at times” or “unable to get psych meds.”</p>

<p>“Open courts are one of the great hallmarks of our justice system and we welcome the engagement and public accountability that court observers provide,” said Vance spokesman Danny Frost.</p>

<p>The New York program is modeled after a 2017 effort in Chicago organized by a group of local nonprofits calling themselves the Coalition to End Money Bond. While New York’s watchers are focused on prosecutors, Chicago’s are interested primarily in judges: In September of 2017, the Cook County chief justice implemented a new rule that judges should not set bail an amount the defendant can’t afford.</p>

<p>The Chicago program trained more than 100 volunteers to sit in Cook County Central Bond Court for a month before the new rule went into effect, and then another month afterwards. What they saw encouraged them: the percentage of cases in which the judge set money bond dropped in half after the new rule, and the percentage in which a judge released the defendant without bond doubled. Still, they recorded almost 100 instances where a judge asked the defendant how much they could afford, as required under the rule — then set the bond higher than that. “There’s a big gap between the law on paper and the law as it’s practiced in courtrooms,” says Sharlyn Grace, a criminal justice analyst with the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice, which is helping to coordinate the effort. The group is releasing a report with its data on Tuesday.</p>

<p>A similar project is ongoing in California, and the Chicago and New York programs inspired one that should be up and running next month in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>But the country’s oldest court-watching organization prides itself on neutrality and objectivity. Simone Levine, executive director of Court Watch NOLA, in New Orleans, says “we are for accountable prosecutors, but we are for accountable everybody. I complain to the public defender’s office when we see public defenders that aren’t doing their job correctly.”</p>

<p>That is unlikely to be the case in New York. Court Watch NYC’s training materials feature a snappy YouTube video about the importance of prosecutors, and its PowerPoint deck includes headshots and scorecards for both Vance and Gonzalez. The group has trained about 150 watchers so far, with another 150 signed up, Aguilera says. A volunteer from Google is helping run a data analysis team. But data is only part of the point, says Rachel Foran, from the Brooklyn Community Bail Fund. More important is making sure the prosecutors know they’re being watched, with the aim of “shifting court practices and culture,” Foran says.</p>

<p>Brooklyn Defender Services produced "The Power of Prosecutors" ahead of the 2017 local elections and uses the video as part of the training for Court Watch NYC, the latest in a growing number of local volunteer court monitoring programs. Brooklyn Defender Services</p>

<p>By contrast, Chicago’s court watching group instructs its watchers to blend as best as possible into the gallery. “Any program that labels the court watchers as court watchers has the effectiveness of a hall monitor,” says Nicole Gonzalez Van Cleve, aa sociologist who helped design an early court watching program in Chicago in 2008. Van Cleve’s 2016 book, “Crook County: Racism and Injustice in America's Largest Criminal Court,” was based in part on her monitoring efforts there. Without anonymity, she says, “as soon as they leave, they’re going to do exactly what they were doing before.”</p>

<p>Or perhaps not. On Twitter, a spokeswoman for Vance recently got into a tussle with Court Watch over a case in which the prosecutor “asked for $7500 bail on misdemeanor shoplifting case. Accused person’s last warrant was from 1992.” Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman, tried to explain the defendant had an “extensive criminal history,” including 21 misdemeanor convictions, but the group’s followers weren’t buying it (“If someone had 21 misdemeanors probably means they need psychiatric help and/or services.”)</p>

<p>“I appreciate you keeping us on our toes,” Vollero wrote.</p>

<p>Correction: This story has been updated to correct a number of factual errors. The earlier version mischaracterized the involvement of public defenders in organizing New York Court Watch.The lawyers are involved as individuals, not as members of their respective organizations. The story also incorrectly said a Chicago program trained 50 volunteers when in fact it trained more than 100. In addition, the story incorrectly recounted the history of the Chicago program; it has not continually operated since 2008. The story also incorrectly said the New York and Chicago programs inspired one in California. The California effort was independent. A reference to the ACLU helping to recruit and fund district attorney candidates was removed because it was not correct.</p>

<h2 id="howbadisprisonhealthcaredependsonwhoswatching">How Bad is Prison Health Care? Depends on Who’s Watching</h2>

<p>A federal judge considers $1 million in fines for one state’s “pervasive and intractable failures.” </p>

<p>In late December, federal Magistrate Judge David Duncan waved an iPad in front of his Phoenix courtroom, enraged. He had just read a local news article suggesting that the Arizona Department of Corrections and its for-profit medical provider Corizon Health were gaming a system put in place to ensure adequate health care for the state’s prisoners. “There is no other way to read it,” he said. “It’s just a game to beat the judge and his monitoring program.”</p>

<p>Duncan has been overseeing a court case aimed at improving medical and mental health care in Arizona prisons. Parsons v. Ryan, which began in 2012, accuses the state of providing care so shoddy that it amounts to cruel and unusual punishment: delayed or denied treatment, too few doctors and nurses, referrals and medication refills that fall through the cracks.</p>

<p>Corizon has served as Arizona’s prison health care provider since 2013. The company is not a defendant in the ongoing legal action, the plaintiffs wrote in a court filing, because the state is ultimately responsible for providing care “regardless of who it hires.” However, the company’s care lies at the heart of the proceedings.</p>

<p>In 2014, Arizona arrived at an agreement with the prisoners that explicitly says that government officials “deny all the allegations.” The state also committed to meeting 103 standards governing everything from how quickly prescriptions are filled to how often those with mental illness see a counselor. Part of the agreement was that the state would measure how well it was meeting the standards and report the results back to the court.</p>

<p>For the first few years, according to the state’s own reports, it did not go well. Among other problems, the state was not providing urgent medication or specialty care quickly enough and prison doctors weren’t reviewing discharge orders for sick prisoners returning from the hospital. “You fundamentally have an obligation to provide these services to these inmates,” Duncan said at a 2016 hearing. “You failed to do it.” At one point the judge called the reports “chilling.”</p>

<p>Now the local news report seemed to indicate that the situation was even worse than the state described.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the Arizona lawsuit, the state must ensure that patients who are referred to specialists see them within 30 days. But the story, by NPR station KJZZ, included an account by a physician who said Corizon asked her to cancel referrals if they weren’t completed in that time frame to avoid fines from the court. “After 30 days we get nailed for 1,000 bucks a day until they are seen,” read an email from a Corizon employee to the physician.</p>

<p>Martha Harbin, a spokesperson for Corizon, told The Marshall Project that Corizon would disprove all of the claims made by KJZZ at an upcoming court hearing. The employee “acted appropriately,” Harbin said. “The email was taken out of context and its meaning distorted by Dr. Watson and KJZZ.” Officials at the Arizona Department of Corrections did not respond to several emails with detailed lists of questions.</p>

<p>Harbin said the company is failing to meet only a small fraction of the standards under the lawsuit and that those failures result from how difficult it is to hire staff in Arizona. In an email, she detailed the company’s extensive efforts to recruit and train staff. “If staffing penalties were merely the cost of doing business, we certainly wouldn’t be funding this level of HR activity,” she said.</p>

<p>Corizon, based in Brentwood, Tenn., is one of the nation’s largest for-profit prison healthcare providers, with contracts in 30 local jails and eight state corrections systems, according to Harbin.</p>

<p>Allegations of mismanagement and poor patient care have recently caused Corizon to lose some high-profile and lucrative contracts. The company has been the target of thousands of lawsuits — including other large-scale class action suits ongoing in Idaho and Alabama.</p>

<p>Any prison or prison-based provider is inevitably going to be a target for legal action, in part because the courts are often prisoners’ only means of redress for grievances large and small. What’s striking about the recent cases, however, is their similarities.</p>

<p>The suits describe a multi-layered bureaucracy in which even routine medical referrals require approval from middle management; a crisis-level shortage of nurses, doctors, psychiatrists, and other medical staff; and serious but treatable illnesses that went untreated and turned deadly. The Arizona claim described a 59-year-old inmate who died after nurses “repeatedly ignored his desperate pleas for help…even after open weeping lesions on [his body] were swarmed by flies.” A handwritten “notice of impending death” was filed by an inmate whose cancer went untreated. “Now because of there delay, I may be luckey to be alive for 30 days,” he wrote in August. He died in September.</p>

<p>The Next To Die </p>

<p>Yet many experts say that the quality of a private contractor’s care comes down to how closely they’re watched. Kansas and Missouri, which both contract with Corizon, have teams monitoring the company’s work. Kansas’s is based at the local university hospital, according to the Kansas City Star; Missouri’s has a nine-person team based at the Department of Corrections, according to a spokesperson there. Kansas’s contract includes financial penalties if Corizon fails to meet certain standards; Missouri’s does not.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen private providers that have done a very good job. That’s because somebody is keeping a watch on them, and their contracts are well run,” says Steve J. Martin, a corrections expert who has served as a court-appointed monitor in several lawsuits.</p>

<p>In Arizona, the Department of Corrections has 33 employees in its “Health Services Contract Monitoring Bureau” tasked with keeping an eye on Corizon, and the contract includes financial penalties. The company has paid upwards of $3 million in fines for not having enough doctors and nurses on staff, according to the testimony of Charles Pratt, who oversees the Corizon contract for the state. But given that the contract is worth more than $150 million a year, even Judge Duncan was skeptical that these fines change the company’s calculus.</p>

<p>“Is it possible that they have made the economic decision that they are better off paying the fine than filling these positions?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It is,” Pratt replied.</p>

<p>In Idaho, where a class action lawsuit similar to the Parsons suit is ongoing, Corizon has been fined $178,000 since 2014 for not having enough staff and other problems, according to state officials. The contract there is worth more than $43 million a year.</p>

<p>“The private provider, their attorneys, are superior in their knowledge of contracts,” said Martin, who is currently serving as a court-appointed monitor on Rikers Island. “More often than not the agency is at a disadvantage. They’re starting 50 yards behind.”</p>

<p>Now Arizona faces $1 million or more in fines as Judge Duncan considers holding officials in contempt for their “pervasive and intractable failures” to meet the terms of the settlement. He could issue his ruling at a hearing on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Settlements, like contracts, need close, ongoing supervision by a neutral party to function effectively, say Martin and other corrections experts. In Idaho, the judge appointed an independent monitor, known as a special master, to evaluate how well the state was providing health and mental health care. Yet he was duped when the state “attempted to paper over and mislead the special master about the inadequacies of its mental health care system,” the judge later found.</p>

<p>The Arizona settlement has no special master. “In the settlement negotiations we pressed hard for an independent monitor, but the state was adamant that it would never agree to such a thing,” says the ACLU’s David Fathi, one of the attorneys representing the prisoners.</p>

<p>The agreement allows the state to monitor itself, which was at issue in the December hearing when the judge was so angry. “I had always been a little bit…concerned about the fact that the fox was guarding the hen house,” Judge Duncan said, noting that he may now appoint an independent auditor.</p>

<p>This post has been updated to reflect that Corizon Health is not a named defendant in the Arizona lawsuit, which predates the company’s contract with the state.</p>

<p>In addition, a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Corizon faces $1 million or more in fines from a judge. The state faces those fines and has indicated it would pass the fines along to Corizon.</p>

<h2 id="ablackmotherssurvivalguideforherteenageson">A Black Mother’s Survival Guide for Her Teenage Son</h2>

<p>by: Leonardo Santamaria</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-14</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/02/15/a-black-mother-s-survival-guide-for-her-teenage-son </p>

<p>"The only right you have, I told him, is to make it home alive." </p>

<p>My son is big for his age. At only 16, he’s already 6 feet 4 inches and 225 pounds. As he grew, I began to have a lot of anxiety because I knew he could get mistaken as an adult. And being an adult black male in St. Louis — like anywhere in America — can be uniquely dangerous, especially when the police are involved.</p>

<p>So recently my son and I began having The Conversation: What to do if he gets stopped by a police officer.</p>

<p>No matter what’s going on, I tell him, stay quiet. Keep your eyes down. Lower your shoulders. Let the air out of your chest. Get the bass out of your voice. Sound as much like a child as possible. And above all, do not make any sudden moves.</p>

<p>Whatever they ask you to do, I tell him, you do.</p>

<p>They are going to jiggle your balls searching for drugs. Your face is going to get dirty, and so are your new clothes, because they’re going to have you on your stomach. Be ready for these things.</p>

<p>At first, my son didn’t quite get it. One day, as we role-played an encounter with the police, he asked, “Mom, well what if it’s cold, don’t I have a right to just reach back and grab my jacket? What if I drop my phone, can I just pick it back up? What if my nose is running, am I supposed to stand there with snot running down my chin?”</p>

<p>“Let it run down to your ankles if you have to,” I said.</p>

<p>He thought he had the right to voice an opinion, to tell an officer he was wrong. The only right you have, I told him, is to make it home alive. Me explaining in court that my son was right in his actions, but dead as a doorknob, is not going to help me.</p>

<p>I know all too well the importance of being subservient to law enforcement. Over the years, I’ve been pulled over by the police for lots of stupid things. Once the officer said it was because my license plate was dirty. My son, who was in the car with me at the time, was so confused. “It’s not dirty,” he told me. “You should say something.” And I kept shaking my head no. I had to teach him it didn’t matter who was right or wrong, only that we made it out of that situation alive.</p>

<p>Still, traffic stops have resulted in me getting jailed many times in St. Louis County, Mo., often over unpaid fines for minor driving-related infractions. It’s a common problem for folks in my area who are financially strapped, especially people of color. Public transportation is very limited, so you need a car. When you’re making nine dollars an hour, and the rent is due at the same time as the car insurance, the car insurance waits for the next check. Not because you’re trying to cheat the system, but because you’re trying to provide for your family. But before you get that next check, you get pulled over for no reason and caught. What happens then? You go on the run. Or you just don’t drive in certain areas. Or you accumulate the warrants and you wait.</p>

<p>Commentary </p>

<p>When my son was small, having him in the car didn’t keep me from getting pulled over, but it did keep me from going to jail; officers would let me go rather than take me in along with a young child. But he wasn’t always there. I remember the first time I had to call to tell my son I wasn’t coming home because I was in jail over traffic tickets. He was about 10 years old, and he just cried and cried.</p>

<p>As my son got bigger, I would sometimes either have him slouch down in the back seat or else we just wouldn’t go through certain municipalities because it looked like two black adults in the car, rather than a mother and her young son.</p>

<p>I know that my son has been affected by my experiences with police. But it was when Michael Brown was shot by an officer in nearby Ferguson, when my son was 12 years old, that he lost some of his innocence. At his school, it was all about the Pledge of Allegiance, that we’re all American citizens, and kumbaya with the world. But he saw that the reality of living in St. Louis as a black man didn’t match those ideals. One time he said, “I don’t think the U.S. Constitution applies in Missouri.” He thought that because of what he was witnessing in his own community.</p>

<p>My son turned 16 in August, and I still have not let him drive. I’m too worried he’ll get pulled over by police. At first, I told him, “Wait until next summer.” Or, “I’ll teach you when you make all As.” But right now he has a 3.7 GPA. Sometimes when he asks me to teach him, I just ask, “So I can get you out of jail?”</p>

<p>I think he’s starting to get it. If my mom can get locked up for traffic stuff, I don’t stand a chance. He hasn’t said a word about getting his license or driving a car in awhile now.</p>

<p>My challenge is: How do I give my son the hope that he can be a productive member of society, but at the same time, let him see society in its ugly, bare-naked truth? My choice has been, I’d prefer to let him know how to really navigate life as it is rather than say: You can be president!</p>

<p>You can be anything you want to be when you grow up! Except, that is, for being black while driving through certain parts of St. Louis.</p>

<p>Meredith Walker, 47, is a plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit filed by ArchCity Defenders in 2016 that alleges residents of the city of Florissant, particularly African-Americans, have been jailed improperly and unconstitutionally solely because they could not afford court fines and fees arising from tickets and other minor offenses.</p>

<h2 id="toosickforjailbutnotforsolitary">Too Sick for Jail — But Not for Solitary</h2>

<p>Tennessee locks ailing, mentally ill, pregnant and juvenile prisoners in isolation to help jails save money. </p>

<p>Regenia Bowman was placed in solitary confinement at the Tennessee Prison for Women in 2014 even though she had only been charged, not convicted of a crime.</p>

<p>Shelley Mays/The Tennessean</p>

<p>he state of Tennessee locked Regenia Bowman in solitary confinement for more than six months because she had a skin infection.</p>

<p>Bowman wasn’t violent, and she hadn’t threatened anyone. She was free on bond when she walked into a courtroom in Bledsoe County in April 2014 to answer charges of selling prescription painkillers, a violation of her probation on a similar charge. During the hearing, when it looked like Bowman was headed to jail, her lawyer revealed she was sick with what turned out to be MRSA, an antibiotic-resistant staph infection.</p>

<p>The judge suggested sending her to a “special needs” facility in Nashville. Bowman, now 54, assumed she would be going to a clinic or hospital.</p>

<p>Instead, she was driven more than 120 miles to the Tennessee Prison for Women, which usually houses people already convicted of a crime. There, without understanding why, she was dressed in white, the uniform of maximum security prisoners. She was placed in solitary — locked down 23 hours a day with three showers a week and fed through a slot in her cell door. The MRSA cleared up in about two months, she said, but records show she was held in these conditions for 189 days.</p>

<p>The Tennessee Prison for Women in Nashville.</p>

<p>“I was terrified,” Bowman said. “The first two days I was so afraid I wouldn’t even go outside because I had no idea what was going on.”</p>

<p>Bowman had been declared a safekeeper.</p>

<p>Under a state law virtually unchanged since 1858, people awaiting trial in Tennessee county jails can be shipped to state prison if a judge deems the local jail “insufficient” to handle their medical problems, mental illness, or behavioral issues. State policy dictates they are kept in solitary confinement, even if they are mentally unstable or have not committed a disciplinary infraction.</p>

<p>From January 2011 through 2017, more than 320 people in Tennessee were declared safekeepers. The numbers have grown in recent years. In 2013, there were 26 safekeepers; in 2017, there were 86.</p>

<p>The law is intended to relieve a financial burden on local jails and get pretrial detainees necessary care or protect jail staff. Some safekeepers have allegedly attacked guards or fashioned crude weapons. But interviews and court records show people are sent to safekeeping because they are juveniles, pregnant, wrestling with severe mental illness, or simply too notorious to remain in county lockup. They have not been convicted of a crime, but all of them are sent far away from their families and defense lawyers and placed in cells usually reserved for the state’s most unruly, dangerous inmates.</p>

<p>From 2011 through 2017, Tennessee judges sent 324 jail detainees to state prison for "safekeeping." The Marshall Project obtained court orders explaining the reasons behind the transfers for 171 of them.</p>

<ul>
<li>Varies from county to county but frequently refers to “conduct and/or condition” placing “an undue burden” on the county, with no other facility being sufficient.</li>
</ul>

<p>Source: Marshall Project analysis of Tennessee court records</p>

<p>One of at least eight states with a safekeeping law, Tennessee has no formal review process to determine if and when inmates should be returned to their original counties.</p>

<p>That means safekeepers have sat in isolation for months or even years as they await trial, even if their conditions improve. While the state does not track precise release dates, a review of records shows safekeeping stays range from a couple of weeks to more than four and a half years. A snapshot from Dec. 31, 2017, shows the average stay of safekeepers was 328 days. Fifteen of the 57 people in safekeeping on that day had been held longer than a year.</p>

<p>“There’s extreme psychological effects on people who are subjected to solitary confinement,” said Tom Castelli, legal director of ACLU Tennessee. “So you are pouring gasoline on a fire, so to speak, if your reaction to someone who’s got mental health issues or disciplinary issues is to isolate them completely.”</p>

<p>safekeeping designation generally happens like this: A county sheriff or jail administrator petitions the District Attorney, saying a detainee has unmanageable issues. The DA then applies for a court order to transfer the inmate. A judge approves.</p>

<p>With one exception, safekeepers have gone to one of three state prisons, all in Nashville. Slightly more than half are sent to Lois M. DeBerry Special Needs Facility, an 854-bed hospital prison for men. The remaining men are sent to Riverbend Maximum Security Institution.</p>

<p>All female safekeepers are sent to Tennessee Prison for Women, where Department of Correction spokeswoman Neysa Taylor said “inmates, safekeepers included, have access to the full gamut of mental health and medical care.”</p>

<p>Dr. Ali Winters, a senior clinical therapist hired by Corizon, the private company providing mental health care to Tennessee prisons, worked with women in solitary at TPFW from June 2013 to mid-2016. She said safekeepers had little access to treatment beyond sporadic conversations with her.</p>

<p>Dr. Ali Winters, a senior clinical therapist, worked with women in solitary confinement at the Tennessee Prison For Women.</p>

<p>“They would be fine, and then within 30 days they wouldn’t be fine because of solitary confinement and what it does to you neurologically,” Winters said. Women experienced depression, mood changes and hallucinations, she said. Her colleague, Lori De Leo, who worked with women in isolation at TPFW from November 2015 to late 2016, agreed that safekeepers would “deteriorate.”</p>

<p>Numerous national studies show the detrimental mental and physical health ramifications of solitary confinement. When an inmate is left in solitary confinement for extended periods of time, he or she may become more anxious or prone to panic attacks, paranoia, and other effects, according to a 2013 study by the American Public Health Association.</p>

<p>People with mental illness placed in solitary confinement “may deteriorate and experience an exacerbation of symptoms,” the study states.</p>

<p>Amanda Beaty has spent more than three years in safekeeping after attempting suicide multiple times while awaiting trial for killing her son in June 2014. In letters to The Marshall Project, she said other safekeepers she saw included two blind women, one pregnant woman, and others who had stopped eating or simply screamed all day. Each name she provided matched state records of safekeepers who were in custody during the time period she described.</p>

<p>Beaty, 34, said when she was put on suicide watch, she had to sleep on a concrete cell floor.</p>

<p>“I was already down in this dark place, and rather than helping me, they just make me feel even worse. It’s horrible,” she said.</p>

<p>One safekeeper, John Raymond Walz, successfully challenged his detention after he was sent to DeBerry on suicide watch in November 2016.</p>

<p>His lawyer, Jeffrey Vires, understood that the local jail didn’t have the resources to keep a close eye on Walz, but he said DeBerry took him off suicide watch after a week — and then held him another seven months before trial, his health deteriorating. The lawyer successfully petitioned a court to release Walz to a Veterans Affairs hospital near his home.</p>

<p>At least seven women have been deemed safekeepers because of issues with their pregnancies, three of them in Fentress County, according to court records. Criminal Court Judge Shayne Sexton, whose jurisdiction includes Fentress and other northeast Tennessee counties, said he didn’t remember specifically signing an order for any pregnant inmates.</p>

<p>But he said he would sign such an order to relieve a rural jail of a potentially steep cost while sending the inmate to what he thought would be a more appropriate facility.</p>

<p>“I would not send anyone on a safekeeping order anywhere if I think where they’re going is a worse place than where they are,” Sexton said.</p>

<p>ounty jail officials expressed frustration, saying that while safekeeping is not ideal, local jails lack the resources to care for severely ill or difficult detainees.</p>

<p>Mentally or physically ill detainees can jeopardize safety, while slim budgets and skyrocketing health costs prohibit the necessary care at the county level. Some administrators pointed to rising drug use and a lack of adequate mental health facilities straining their resources.</p>

<p>“There’s no room at the inn, figuratively speaking. I can’t put [them] with the other inmates,” said Captain Scotty McKay, jail administrator for Franklin County. “When budgets are cut statewide and nationwide, I think mental health is the first thing to get cut. And I think we’re going backwards.”</p>

<p>In January 2016, Sonya Babb, a woman with a long history of mental health problems, was experiencing severe delusions. She fatally shot her father in his Carter County home because she believed he had killed her son, even though he was alive. Babb’s attorney, Assistant Public Defender Melanie Sellers, said safekeeping was the only option to get the now 56-year-old Babb any help.</p>

<p>Sonya Babb, left, charged with first-degree murder in the death of her father at an appearance in court in Tennessee in 2016.</p>

<p>“It’s just one of those things where the pure human misery was just overwhelming,” said Sellers, who prepared the letter requesting the transfer.</p>

<p>Babb’s only treatment in TPFW was medication, her lawyer said. She was held in solitary confinement for more than a year before she was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to a mental health facility. Sellars said she does not regret asking for the safekeeper designation. The county jail would have been worse.</p>

<p>Cost appears to be a major factor in keeping safekeepers in state custody. While other safekeeping states require the sending county to cover costs, in Tennessee, the state pays the bill.</p>

<p>“Truth is, the county would have to agree [to take a safekeeper back], and most will not,” said Sonya Troutt, jail administrator for the Sumner County Sheriff’s Office.</p>

<p>Circuit Court Judge Thomas Graham, who presided over Regenia Bowman’s safekeeping hearing, said he would prefer to send defendants with serious medical issues to hospitals, but counties cannot shoulder the cost.</p>

<p>The judge was surprised to hear that safekeepers are held in solitary confinement. “The only thing we're trying to do is get them medical care,” he said.</p>

<p>eriyona Winton turned 16 this year in the maximum security unit at Tennessee Prison for Women, more than 200 miles from home. Just 15 when she was accused of murder in Memphis last May, Winton is one of three teenage girls Shelby County has sent to safekeeping since 2011, records show.</p>

<p>After Winton was charged as an adult and the county said it was not equipped to hold her, the hearing declaring her a safekeeper lasted about two minutes, said her current attorney, Josh Spickler. There was no evidence presented, and she did not have a lawyer.</p>

<p>Her mother, Latosha Winton, 38, saw her daughter this week during a court hearing, the first time since the teen was moved to TPFW in October. Latosha Winton works on Saturdays, the prison's visiting day, and did not have a car to make the six-hour round-trip trek.</p>

<p>An analysis of all safekeepers since 2011 found they were sent an average distance of 117 miles from their home counties, making it difficult to communicate with family and lawyers before a trial. Taylor, the DOC spokeswoman, said that other factors, including safety and medical needs, “take priority over proximity to home.”</p>

<p>Winton can shower three days a week and go out for recreation two days a week, Spickler said. When she leaves her cell, her feet and hands are shackled. Every weekday, teachers instruct her for two hours through the flap in her door, Spickler said.</p>

<p>“She’s just feeling down, basically just ready for it to be over with,” her mother said. Spickler challenged Winton's safekeeping in court, and on Thursday, a judge ordered that Winton be sent back to Shelby County.</p>

<p>Demetria Frank, an assistant professor of law at the University of Memphis, expressed disbelief that the state’s largest county had no facilities for female minors, particularly after a 2012 Justice Department report faulted the county for failing to properly safeguard juveniles in detention.</p>

<p>“They’re on 23-hour lockdown, that’s just unacceptable for anyone, especially if the period is indefinitely,” Frank said. “The state of Tennessee should be ashamed of itself.”</p>

<p>Shelby County Criminal Court judges J. Robert Carter, Jr. and W. Mark Ward, who have signed safekeeping orders for juveniles in the Memphis area, did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>n 1980, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals unanimously ruled that the intention of the safekeeping law was to send people to another local jail, not state prison. The stigma of going to prison before a conviction is so strong that safekeeper transfers there are allowed only if counties prove to a judge there is no “sufficient” jail nearby, the court ruled. Despite this, a Marshall Project review of jails in seven of Tennessee’s largest counties found that none reported accepting a safekeeper in recent memory, nor had any been offered one.</p>

<p>Taylor, the DOC spokeswoman, said those determinations are made by judges. Graham, the judge in Bowman’s case, said no county likely would be willing to shoulder the burden and cost of an ailing inmate from another county.</p>

<p>Like Graham, F. Lee Russell, a former longtime judge in East Tennessee, and Sexton, the criminal court judge, said they did not realize safekeepers were kept in solitary confinement at the state prison.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine solitary being good for anyone,” Sexton said.</p>

<p>The practice raised concerns among several Tennessee state lawmakers, including House Health Committee Chairman Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, and Sen. Ed Jackson, R-Jackson, chairman of the Senate corrections subcommittee.</p>

<p>“Clearly, taking someone and placing them in solitary confinement, that is different than just being in the county jail,” said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Mike Stewart, D-Nashville, a frequent critic of the Tennessee prison system. “That is a severe punishment.” He said it was “unacceptable” for juveniles to be held in solitary before a trial.</p>

<p>Bowman, who was eventually convicted and spent 18 months in prison, said she got out of safekeeping only after she and her daughter repeatedly called Bledsoe and Sequatchie counties, where she had open cases, to pressure them into bringing her back. Her defense lawyer at the hearing did not respond to several requests for comment.</p>

<p>Bowman said she still suffers from the effects of her time in solitary. She is now out on parole and said she tries to avoid being around people.</p>

<p>“I start hyperventilating, I start feeling like the walls are closing in on me. If there are several people, I can do it for five or 10 minutes and then I start finding a way out,” Bowman said.</p>

<p>“The things you see there you don’t forget.”</p>

<h2 id="mississippimoonlighting">Mississippi Moonlighting</h2>

<p>by: Nicole Lewis</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-07</p>

<p>When District Attorney Michael P. Guest announced his bid for U.S. Congress in a packed courtroom in January, he touted his law and order record. Since 2008, Guest has served as district attorney for Madison and Rankin counties, two majority white and relatively affluent counties in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Guest said that he has prosecuted 20,000 felony cases and helped claim over $20 million for local law enforcement agencies through the use of civil asset forfeiture. His entire career, he said, has been dedicated to protecting, “citizens from those who would prey upon others.”</p>

<p>One thing Guest did not mention is his other paying job: municipal debt collector. Since 2002, Guest has served as president of Mississippi Court Collections Inc. (MCC), which collects delinquent court fines and fees in at least 20 counties across the state.</p>

<p>In recent years, civil rights advocates in Mississippi have argued that municipal courts’ charging of fines and fees for low level offenses has created a modern version of debtors prisons, where people who can’t afford to pay their fines languish behind bars. The system, they argue, criminalizes poverty and violates citizens’ constitutional right to due process while serving as a revenue generating mechanism for municipalities that are strapped for cash. In Mississippi, where 22 percent of residents live in poverty, according to U.S. Census figures, the issue of fines and fees is the subject of several lawsuits and legislative proposals in the state.</p>

<p>Guest’s involvement in a for-profit collection company is perfectly legal but clashes with the commonly held notion of district attorneys as “public servants” who have given up the chance to earn larger paychecks in the private sector. Instead, Guest profits from a system that many in Mississippi say traps poor people in a cycle of poverty.</p>

<p>In Mississippi, Guest’s connection to MCC is a matter of public record, but many officials said they did not know he was associated with the company. On his financial disclosure form with the Mississippi Ethics Commission, Guest listed himself as a stockholder of the collections agency. But on the company’s annual business filings Guest is consistently listed as president. The Marshall Project reached out to Guest to clarify his relationship to MCC, but he did not respond to repeated requests for comment.</p>

<p>Asked by The Clarion-Ledger about this, Guest replied that there was no intent to mislead, saying he is both the president and a stockholder, owning 50 percent of the company. The other owner serves as vice president.</p>

<p>"I don't have anything to do with the day-to-day operations, he said.</p>

<p>In a 2003 interview with a local newspaper, Guest said he first got the idea to create MCC after mulling over the problem of unpaid back fines with his colleagues. At the time, Guest served as the assistant district attorney in Rankin County. Guest’s initial collection contract was for $1.7 million with Simpson County, and since then MCC has expanded its contracts across the state.</p>

<p>To date the company has at least 20 contracts to collect outstanding fines from justice courts throughout Mississippi, though it does not collect fines for Rankin and Madison counties where Guest is DA. Mississippi’s justice courts oversee misdemeanor criminal cases, traffic violations, bond hearings in felony criminal cases, and some civil matters. In several counties, MCC is charged with collecting millions of dollars in unpaid fines.</p>

<p>Mississippi law allows companies like Guest’s to charge an additional 25 percent on top of the initial fine for collecting from state residents, and 50 percent for out-of-state residents. MCC sends letters urging residents to pay their fines or risk arrest. MCC reports its progress to the courts on a 30-day basis. If the fine holders do not pay, MCC warns they could be held in contempt of court, resulting in the court issuing an arrest warrant.</p>

<p>“Collection efforts like these are part of a system that, at least in part, threatens poor people in hopes of shaking the last pennies from their pockets,” said Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center at The University of Mississippi. “Telling poor Mississippians that they will be jailed if they don't pay their fines immediately is misleading and heavy-handed.”</p>

<p>In June 2017, the Justice Center settled a class action lawsuit against the city of Jackson, Mississippi for jailing people who failed to pay misdemeanor court fines. The court found the city’s practice violated the defendant’s constitutional rights, citing the 1983 U.S. Supreme Court case, Bearden v. Georgia, that established individuals can not be jailed for nonpayment of fines without a meaningful inquiry into their ability to pay.</p>

<p>Similar lawsuits are pending in other counties in Mississippi. Civil rights groups in several states throughout the South, including Mississippi’s nearest neighbors, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Alabama, have successfully sued the courts to stop the practice of jailing people for failing to pay their fines.</p>

<p>The issue of fines and fees came into sharp relief in 2015, as a result of a Justice Department investigation into the police department in Ferguson, Missouri where police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown. The DOJ found the police department routinely targeted African American drivers, pulling them over at twice the rate of white drivers. Additionally, the report found that the municipal court system served as a revenue generating mechanism for the city.</p>

<p>A year later, the DOJ sent guidelines to local courts cautioning them against issuing burdensome fines to poor defendants, asserting that issuing steep fines for minor offenses often traps poor people into an endless cycle of poverty and erodes trust between local government and the people it is sworn to serve. The current attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recently rescinded the Obama-era guidance.</p>

<p>During the 2017 legislative session, local lawmakers passed a bipartisan bill that would have ended automatic incarceration following the nonpayment of fines or court costs. But Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant vetoed the bill over a separate provision that would have allowed some repeat offenders early release.</p>

<p>Other efforts to address disparities in the justice system have proved more fruitful. In December 2017, the Southern Poverty Law Center settled with Mississippi’s Department of Public Safety to reinstate more than 100,000 drivers licenses that were suspended for a failure to pay fines. SPLC argued that suspending licenses disproportionately affected poor residents, especially those in rural areas with limited public transportation.</p>

<p>For Myesha Braden, Director for the Criminal Justice Project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who is working on similar issues in Arkansas, Alabama, and Louisiana, Guest’s involvement in the fines and fees collection business is unsettling. It is a reminder that personal financial interests can run counter to the rising political will to reform the criminal justice system throughout the region.</p>

<p>“You have to ask the question,” said Braden, “as DA, when there have been opportunities to reform, what has he had to say in those meetings?”</p>

<h2 id="thebureauofprisonsyieldstoachaplainsconscience">The Bureau of Prisons Yields to a Chaplain’s Conscience</h2>

<p>by: Justin George</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-26</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/01/26/the-bureau-of-prisons-yields-to-a-chaplain-s-conscience </p>

<p>A prison chaplain put President Donald Trump’s pledge to protect religious freedom to the test and won a longshot fight against the Bureau of Prisons.</p>

<p>The BOP reversed an order requiring the Rev. Ronald Apollo, a military and federal prison chaplain for more than 25 years, to carry pepper spray while on the job. This month, the BOP announced that chaplains will no longer be required to carry the spray.</p>

<p>Apollo is the the head chaplain of FCI Bennettsville, a medium-security federal correctional institute in South Carolina. When the BOP ordered all of its prison workers in medium and higher level security institutions to carry around Oleoresin Capsicum or “O.C.” aerosol spray last year prompted by a federal law that had been passed to keep prison staff safe, Apollo balked saying it violated his religious beliefs. He also said the requirement jeopardized the impartiality he needs to counsel prisoners and win their trust.</p>

<p>Pepper spray, he said, made him appear as if he was working with correctional officers.</p>

<p>Apollo is a member of the Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith, which calls on its members in its bylaws to renounce “the weapons of human strife.” Apollo argues that the spray — similar to what police use to control unruly crowds — is a weapon, a characterization the BOP disputes. Apollo is also a retired military chaplain for the Air Force, where he said he was explicitly prohibited from carrying a weapon or protective equipment, even in combat zones.</p>

<p>The BOP’s policy was prompted by the passage of the Eric Williams Correctional Officer Protection Act of 2015. Williams, 34, was a correctional officer who was stabbed to death by a prisoner in 2013 while working at a high-security federal prison in Pennsylvania. The act directs the BOP to issue O.C. spray to “any officer or employee of Bureau of Prisons who is employed in a prison that is not a minimum or low security prison” and “to such additional officers and employees of prisons as the (BOP) Director determines appropriate.”</p>

<p>Apollo and two chaplains he supervised appealed to FCI Bennettsville’s warden and the Bureau of Prisons repeatedly but ultimately were told that they needed to comply. Unwilling, Apollo was confined to front-office work where he could do managerial tasks but could not meet and counsel inmates.</p>

<p>The Marshall Project detailed this standoff between religious rights and prison safety in September. The Liberty Counsel, a nonprofit litigation, education and policy organization that provides free assistance in cases where it believes religious freedom and Christian values are being violated, saw the story and took up the chaplain’s case.</p>

<p>Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman, said he understands that prisons have a duty to protect prisoners and staff but he said there is no evidence chaplains have been endangered by not carrying pepper spray.</p>

<p>The policy “created a barrier of trust and openness with the people they are ministering to,” he said.</p>

<p>Become a Member </p>

<p>In making its case, Liberty Counsel attorneys wrote that the BOP’s own personnel classifications state that chaplains aren’t to participate in firearms training and that “in the event of an actual disturbance the professional skills of a chaplain will be applied in another way.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, the response of a chaplain to an emergency, in the chaplain’s pastoral role, has often resulted in the avoidance of violence, because prisoners trust unarmed chaplains among the inmate population as ‘men of God’ and ‘people of faith,’ and it is almost unheard of for chaplains to be subjected to assault by inmates,” the counsel wrote in a letter in October to the BOP.</p>

<p>Staver said the BOP’s policy violated federal religious protections including the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which prohibits the federal government from imposing or implementing a land use regulation “that imposes a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person.” The law puts the onus on the government to prove that the policy is necessary and that there aren’t other ways for the government to achieve its goal.</p>

<p>If the BOP was looking to keep chaplains safe, Staver said, they could have offered alternatives that didn’t violate Apollo’s rights such as searching prisoners before they meet with pastoral staff or providing a screened and secure space for meetings.</p>

<p>“It’s the government’s burden to prove that they have looked at every other possible means,” Staver said.</p>

<p>Additionally, Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Oct. 6 issued a 25-page, 20-point memo to all executive departments and agencies emphasizing the importance of protecting religious rights including “the right to act or abstain from action in accordance with one’s religious beliefs.” Federal agencies should not burden a person’s exercise of religion unless it can prove that a rule “is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling governmental interest,” Sessions memo stated, highlighting guidelines in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.</p>

<p>Apollo said he cried late last year when he was told the BOP would be reversing its decision and that he could go back to work as normal, ending his nine-month ordeal.</p>

<p>“Now we are able to work on a level to do everything we could do before, in the same capacity, exactly how we were doing it before when OC spray was never an issue,” Apollo said. “We still respond to alarms, we still preach, we could counsel and we’re free to go about all areas of the institution like the ministers we were hired to be without any reservations.”</p>

<p>While he had sat in limbo in a front office, unable to counsel prisoners face-to-face, he said he had received emails from prisoners pleading for his counseling, including one who was grieving for a sister who had died. Apollo could only respond with an email and a Bible verse for encouragement.</p>

<h2 id="howpostprisonreentryprogramsfailqueerwomen">How Post-Prison Reentry Programs Fail Queer Women</h2>

<p>by: Calum Heath</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-23</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/01/24/how-post-prison-reentry-programs-fail-queer-women </p>

<p>If the goal of reentry programming is to empower people returning from incarceration to make the most of their lives, then the system is failing women. While so many wise women have warned against our relying solely on men, the correctional settings that I’ve visited appear either not to have those aunties among their leadership, or not to have taken the message to heart. As a result, they make reentry harder for women who are not in relationships with men, or who desire relationships with women.</p>

<p>For nearly two years, I volunteered and conducted research at a privately-owned halfway house in Pennsylvania. It was a facility for women recently released from prison or who had violated the terms of their probation. As a behavioral health expert, my work with the residents focused on helping to identify their reintegration needs.</p>

<p>To that end, I worked alongside the program’s full-time executive director, a part-time admissions director and other staffers. I also operated as an embedded criminologist, observing and recording the experiences of the approximately 40 women who resided at the house at any given time.</p>

<p>Their stays lasted anywhere from 30 days to 12 months. In that time, the women were tasked with rebuilding their lives, often from the ground up. The cornerstone of that effort was a mandatory Reentry Home Plan outlining each resident’s next steps—her plans for housing, employment, family reintegration, and sometimes drug treatment. </p>

<p>These women—many of them reconciling histories of substance misuse, violence, trauma, racism, sexism, and isolation—were working hard to rebuild their lives and draft plans that were sustainable and healthy. Sadly, I saw many penalized for pursuing lives post-incarceration that supervisors deemed “risky” simply because they did not fit gendered or heteronormative ideas of success. For queer women especially, it created challenges to reentry instead of eliminating them.</p>

<p>Heterosexual women seeking day passes to visit family and male romantic partners were usually granted them, for example. Explicitly or ostensibly queer women at the house were not permitted to spend time “on the outside” with female associates with whom a potential sexual encounter was assumed.</p>

<p>One queer woman, Jodi, told me that her probation officer knew that the woman she wanted to visit was her partner, and she was subsequently not allowed to see her. The probation officer told her that visits needed to be restricted to family, and that “it wasn’t a good time for her to hang with friends.”</p>

<p>Jodi shared her disappointment with me that her probation officer apparently did not see the value in her reconnecting with her partner of several years. Simultaneously watching her heterosexual counterparts confront fewer visitation restrictions left her feeling shattered and cheated.</p>

<p>Queer residents were further vexed by the refusal of probation officers and halfway house supervisors to approve home plans that included same-sex female partnerships. Claire, who knew better than to disclose that she planned to live with the female partner that she had grown quite close to while incarcerated, was devastated when a fellow resident revealed their relationship to a halfway house staff member.</p>

<p>ViewFinder </p>

<p>Claire later shared with me that she cycled into a depressive episode that lasted for weeks, after hearing the house monitor declare, “the time for y’all to be touchin’, ticklin’, and gigglin’ is over. Now is when you get serious about who you want to be.”</p>

<p>Indeed, none of the women I met at the halfway house could cite positive past relationships with men, yet all were encouraged to pursue reentry plans that involved men. In fact, residents shared that house staff and probation officers often encouraged plans that involved a male partner, whether or not he was economically secure, but discouraged plans that included a criminally uninvolved, economically secure female partner.</p>

<p>Residents came to believe that performing traditional gender norms would earn a more favorable assessment. They responded largely by faking their way through counseling sessions and assessments, ensuring that official case notes told the story that they imagined probation officers needed to believe.</p>

<p>Such an approach has absolutely nothing to do with successful reentry for formerly-incarcerated women and everything to do with forcing women to fit into a dated, heteronormative, middle-class ideal — one, ironically, that led many of the women into the criminal justice system through the actions and influences of male partners.</p>

<p>Residents navigating this all too common prisoner reentry context, leave unaffirmed and unprepared to chart life plans that support the new positive life trajectories to which they aspire. As such, the fallout for them and their communities is profound.</p>

<p>Queer women deserve better from our criminal justice system, especially reentry programs supposedly aimed at helping them self-actualize. I propose establishing reentry approaches that rely on the wisdoms of women coming out of these spaces, and will ones that address the needs of women as they are articulated by the women themselves.</p>

<p>Growing up, my mother and aunties drilled into my head that “a man is not a financial plan.” It’s a necessary reminder for any young girl growing up in a society that encourages women to be dependent on men, and is one that I wish was incorporated into (and meaningfully enabled by) our criminal legal system.</p>

<p>Erin M. Kerrison is an assistant professor in the School of Social Welfare at the University of California, Berkeley, and an incoming senior research fellow at the Center for Policing Equity. Her research and advocacy work highlights how criminal justice intervention shapes health outcomes for individuals and their communities.</p>

<h2 id="takingpolicereformtotrumpcountry">Taking Police Reform to Trump Country</h2>

<p>by: Simone Weichselbaum</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-23</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/01/23/taking-police-reform-to-trump-country </p>

<p>This story was produced in collaboration with PBS NEWSHOUR.</p>

<p>Correspondent: John Carlos Frey | Producer: Mike Fritz</p>

<p>Additional Reporting By Manuel Villa</p>

<p>Volusia County, Florida — This was one of the last places in the South to end segregation, a land today of gun enthusiasts and NASCAR, where Jews are still cautioned not to draw attention by hanging mezuzahs on their doors, and local history books say little, or nothing, about African-American life here. The most notable change in the county’s demographics in the generations since Jim Crow is that black sharecroppers who used to tend white-owned farms have been replaced by thousands of undocumented Mexican farmhands.</p>

<p>Volusia is Trump country. It gave the Republican victor 54% of its vote in 2016.</p>

<p>So how, in this time of acrimonious national division, did Volusia County elect as its sheriff a man like Michael J. Chitwood, a product of South Philadelphia, a self-styled progressive reformer, a vocal defender of undocumented immigrants? How did Chitwood gain endorsements from both the National Rifle Association and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and decisively defeat both the favorite of the good-ol’-boy network and the darling of the deputies union?</p>

<p>And with such a mandate, how is he holding up a year into the Trump administration?</p>

<p>Chitwood, 54, is the son of a police chief in a Philadelphia suburb, and rose to lieutenant in the Philadelphia Police Department. He moved south eleven years-ago to accept an appointment as chief of police in this county’s urban core, Daytona Beach. He says he ran for the sheriff’s job because an elected post would be less beholden to civilian bureaucrats. There has been speculation that this is a debut for higher office.</p>

<p>Part of Chitwood’s appeal, like Trump’s, is a brash, uncensored, critics-be-damned style that makes him a forceful and familiar presence on local TV. He is famous for calling crime suspects “scumbags,” and insulting — in his Rocky Balboa accent — politicians, lawyers and anyone else who disagrees with his unfiltered opinions. In May, embroiled in a budget dispute, he called the county’s highest-ranking executive “a lying sack of shit.”</p>

<p>An error occurred.</p>

<p>Try watching this video on www.youtube.com, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.</p>

<p>Around here, that is regarded as “telling it like it is,” especially since he is an egalitarian insulter. “He calls anybody a scumbag,” said Clarence “Bo” Davenport, the former longtime director of public works in the county seat. “I said, ‘Man, you can’t come down to the South with that junk. Them good ol’ boys take care of you.’ I told him that. Well, he looked at me, and said, ‘I can handle myself.’”</p>

<p>Chitwood is a registered independent, and while his demeanor is Trumpian, his views on criminal justice are anything but. Over beers, Chitwood tends to go off on social justice soliloquies that emphasize the woeful legacy of segregation or the dire need for federal immigration reform.</p>

<p>Since January 2017 he has worked from the reformist playbook, adopting measures he had practiced in Daytona Beach — deploying the data-driven policing strategy known as Compstat, instructing officers to never turn off their body cameras when responding to a call, mandating classes on de-escalating conflict and police bias, and deemphasizing the weapons proficiency of new recruits: “Why is it so important that the first thing we do is assess your shooting skills?” he asks.</p>

<p>Noting that since 2012 sheriff’s deputies have fatally shot 13 civilians, Chitwood spent $92,000 in drug forfeiture money to hire a Washington D.C. policing think tank to review the agency’s use of force. He removed the training academy’s welcome sign, which celebrated, “Confidence In the Line of Fire,” explaining, “what that preaches is that we are military. And that’s the problem with my training division. I have so many ex-military guys in there.”</p>

<p>To the department’s old guard, this is seen as an attempt to transplant Eastern elite notions in alien soil.</p>

<p>“If you can’t shoot a gun, and you don’t have the ability to learn how to shoot a gun, you aren’t going to be any good to us,” retorted Evan Ort, a former army marksman who was the department’s gun instructor until June when he quit in protest. Ort was infuriated when Chitwood brought in the consultants from the Police Executive Research Forum to critique the department’s culture. He warned that the new emphasis on de-escalation was likely to get a deputy killed, and he mocked the sheriff’s New Agey talk of “wellness” and “mindfulness” as irrelevant to a department that he said is understaffed and overworked.</p>

<p>“Those cats are fucking tired, plain and simple,” Ort said. “When you are that tired, you aren’t going to eat healthy. You are not going to have any mindfulness because you are fucking tired all the time.”</p>

<p>Chitwood’s most formidable obstacle is resistance within his cadre of 415 officers. He scored a few points with his troops after being part of a successful months-long contract negotiation with the union, formalized on December 21, which bumps deputies’ starting salary to about $19 per hour. The pay increases don’t lessen the rank-and-file disdain for their new boss. Overtime shifts are mandatory, deputies complain of more aggressive discipline (though that is not reflected in department records) and deputies are quitting or retiring at a pace that accelerated when Chitwood took over.</p>

<p>One deputy was fired in September because he insulted Chitwood’s leadership style in a Facebook post. (Law enforcement officers, Chitwood noted, don’t have the same First Amendment rights as civilians.) Deputies have passed around a clip from a German movie of Hitler berating his generals, with subtitles taken from Chitwood’s rants. “It’s been a rough first year for the deputies,” says Sgt. Brodie Hughes, president of the Volusia County Deputies Association.</p>

<p>Detractors see Chitwood as calculating, noting that he told the NRA in a pre-endorsement questionnaire that he would consider supporting a law to let Floridians carry weapons openly, a position the Florida Sheriffs Association and most progressives oppose. The gun lobby awarded him an “A” grade. Chitwood said he just registered a willingness to discuss the issue.</p>

<p>Presented with all this criticism, Chitwood responded, “All I am gonna say is this: fuck ‘em. I got a job for four years, if they don’t like it, get out.”</p>

<p>Pressed about how he expects to create lasting reforms in such a toxic environment, Chitwood cast his critics as the vestiges of a time that is past, or soon will be.</p>

<p>“The easy part for me is convincing the residents. The residents have seen me at work for ten years” in Daytona Beach, Chitwood said in one of several interviews. “The cops, they are the skeptical ones. They are the harder group to get to follow you. Because no one likes to be second guessed. No one wants to change. The community embraces change. They want an accountable, well-trained police force that is in tune in their community.”</p>

<p>“They’ve grown up in a cocoon here,” he said of his deputies. “They train together. They don’t look to train outside. They don’t read articles from outside. They don’t get educated from outside. Everything is Volusia County.”</p>

<p>Chitwood intends to expose his officers to reform scholars and the more liberal policing cultures of Los Angeles and New York, “where they can see ‘oh shit, there’s another way of doing things’.”</p>

<p>The old way of doing things was embodied by Chitwood’s predecessor, Ben Johnson, who retired in December 2016 after 16 years as sheriff.</p>

<p>In 1972, as a young deputy, Johnson fatally shot an unarmed black man as he fled from police custody. A grand jury cleared Johnson, but the episode contributed to a mistrust among African-Americans that lingered throughout his tenure as sheriff.</p>

<p>On his watch, the county spent at least $671,500 settling deputies’ use-of-force and false arrest cases, according to legal records.</p>

<p>From 2011 to 2013, Johnson’s agency was investigated by the U.S Justice Department after a Latino resident complained that deputies responding to a domestic violence call detained the wrong person because they couldn’t understand Spanish. Volusia County is 12% Latino, not including the estimated 10,000 to 20,000 undocumented residents who’ve migrated mainly from Mexico. Federal officials faulted the sheriff’s office for having no in-house translators and for offering English-only forms and pamphlets to the public.</p>

<p>The way Chitwood sees it, Johnson alienated black and Latino neighborhoods, and the new sheriff now has to repair the damage. Chitwood attends Sunday service at Mexican churches, visits taco stands to eat alongside undocumented farm workers and frequently accuses his predecessor of being indifferent to their concerns.</p>

<p>Johnson fiercely disputes the suggestion of racism or apathy, saying that he was “the sheriff for everybody.”</p>

<p>Sitting next to his wife one afternoon at a restaurant, Johnson parried a barrage of personal attacks from his successor, and finally broke down in tears. “All I want to see is success for him, but don’t hurt people to get it,” he said, wiping his eyes. “He doesn’t have to come in there and destroy what’s been done.” Johnson has returned to politics, and plans to run for a county council seat in 2018.</p>

<p>Where Chitwood departs most conspicuously from the president’s rhetoric is on the subject of immigration. Volusia County prides itself as being the “Fern Capital of the World,” where thousands of acres of farmland produce the leafy green stalks that fill floral bouquets across the nation. On average, fern workers earn about $9 an hour for a job where snake bites and mangled fingers are common. Undocumented Mexicans do most of the work.</p>

<p>Out of self-interest, Volusia has become in recent years a virtual sanctuary for migrants without papers. From 2010 to 2014 the county’s corrections department turned over 197 people to U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement, but in 2015 the cooperation tapered off sharply based on advice of Sheriff Johnson’s legal counsel.</p>

<p>Chitwood inherited the policy, and at least verbally, has embraced it with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Why are we focused on immigration?” he asks. “Who the fuck cares? Our job in law enforcement is to protect victims and witnesses. It doesn’t matter what your immigration status is.”</p>

<p>Chitwood said he had also instructed his deputies to stop what he said was the common practice of pulling over Hispanic-looking drivers and citing them for lacking licenses. It is impossible to tell whether this kind of racial profiling has changed because many deputies — ignoring the department’s written policy —fail to record the ethnicity of drivers they stop.</p>

<p>Chitwood is a one-man display of what the reform jargon calls “community policing.” He clocks 25-to-35 miles each day riding alone on his bike, and likes to zoom around the predominantly black neighborhoods of Daytona Beach where his celebrity is most pronounced.</p>

<p>Children scream out “Chitwood, Chitwood” as he pedals by. When he roams the streets on foot, adults stop him every few feet and ask to pose for selfies. The recent barrage of national news footage featuring white cops shooting unarmed African-Americans hasn’t diminished Chitwood’s connection to black Floridians. Here on the Westside of Daytona Beach, Chitwood seems to be beloved.</p>

<p>Chitwood likes to show up — unannounced and often in bike clothes — at crime scenes and at the homes of unsuspecting suspects and victims. His hyper hands-on style attracts glowing news stories, but at the same time, deputies and perpetrators’ relatives say he overdoes the drama. Mary Smith, an 84-year-old Volusia resident, recounted how Chitwood showed up in sweaty biking gear to take command of deputies dealing with a routine domestic dispute involving her son, and the incident escalated into a hostage situation. “He feels that he IS the department, and the other deputies are just lackeys for him,” said Smith, who voted for Chitwood. (In Chitwood’s version, he was able to safely end a three-hour stand-off with an armed suspect.)</p>

<p>There was also a Saturday evening in Daytona Beach, when Chitwood tracked down the mother of a 10-year-old boy who had helped steal his $3,500 Cervelo bike. The boy had served as a lookout as his 15-year-old friend cut the bicycle off of Chitwood’s unmarked patrol car while the sheriff was attending a nearby Juneteenth party in a city park. The theft was captured on surveillance video.</p>

<p>Chitwood, initially, didn’t want to press charges against the 10-year-old, but the boy’s mother, Deidre Moore, thought otherwise. “As a black parent, you really don’t want to put your child in the system,” she explained. “But I need help.” Her son had already been arrested for stealing a car. She asked Chitwood to get her son into an electronic monitoring program where he would wear an ankle bracelet and work closely with social workers.</p>

<p>Chitwood honored the request, but five weeks later the boy was in juvenile custody and made national headlines after stealing several more cars. “If you stop believing in people, and stop giving people breaks and try to do better for them, you might as well quit,” Chitwood said.</p>

<p>Then Chitwood almost died during a late September morning after a pickup truck hit him as he rode his Cervelo on a waterfront road. He now rides his spare — a $1,100 Cannondale mountain bike. Despite the recent mishaps, he refuses to give up his one-man patrol beat. “I lead from the front, I’m going to show up at scenes, I’m in charge of the army.”</p>

<p>Brandon Hewett wants to go to prison.</p>

<p>There, he might have a shot at fresh air, sunshine and substance abuse treatment. Instead, the 38-year-old Hewett is serving a nine-year drunk driving sentence in a North Carolina county jail, a facility not designed or equipped for long-term stays.</p>

<p>Hewett is among a growing number of DWI offenders serving multi-year sentences in North Carolina’s jails, snagged between a reform that cut the prison population and a popular law that cracked down on repeat drunk drivers.</p>

<p>Brandon Hewett is serving a nine-year drunk driving sentence in a North Carolina county jail.</p>

<p>More than 170 people with DWI sentences of two years or more are serving their time in the state’s jails, which were built to detain people awaiting trial or serving short sentences. Unlike prisons, jails have little or no programs for drug treatment, education and job training, and they lack outside yards with basketball courts, ball fields and weight racks.</p>

<p>Hewett, who admits he is an alcoholic, has a 20-year record of alcohol and traffic violations. He said he was shocked when his guilty plea led to nine years in the jail, a one-story block structure at a corner of the Brunswick County office complex. He glimpses the sky for a few minutes a day when he helps unload meals from a truck. The hardest part of the sentence is the prospect of serving nine years with no time outside.</p>

<p>“It’s inhumane,” he said. “They treat me like a murderer.”</p>

<p>Hewett grew up in the country and worked on a dredge boat and as a roofer. He asked to work at the county animal shelter, about 10 miles from the jail. The Brunswick County Sheriff’s Department runs the shelter and has employed inmates there. Sheriff John Ingram did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>“I could keep ‘em clean, keep ‘em fed, keep ‘em watered,” Hewett said. “But they’re scared I might run.”</p>

<p>he road to Hewett’s nine-year sentence began in July 2010, when 17-year-old Laura Fortenberry was killed by a drunk driver with a history of DWI convictions.</p>

<p>The girl’s mother began campaigning for “Laura’s Law,” which called for mandatory prison sentences of 12 to 36 months for certain repeat offenders.</p>

<p>The bill had no opposition in the Republican-controlled legislature; the Democratic governor invited Laura’s mother to the bill-signing. The same year saw the passage of the state Justice Reinvestment Act, which, among other changes, reduced the prison population by sending most misdemeanor offenders to county jails, where they would serve a maximum of 300 days. In a later session, lawmakers amended the law to send everyone convicted of a misdemeanor to jail — which includes people sentenced under Laura’s Law.</p>

<p>Gregg Stahl, director of government relations at the North Carolina Sheriffs Association, realized that these drunk drivers would be the longest serving jail inmates in modern history. Given their high risk of recidivism, they would need treatment.</p>

<p>“Should these inmates be encouraged to participate and complete a drug treatment program while incarcerated?” Stahl wrote in an internal 2014 memo. “What type of drug treatment program can be effectively delivered in a jail setting?”</p>

<p>Case in Point </p>

<p>Association Director Eddie Caldwell said in an interview he doesn’t recall Stahl’s memo or discussion about it. He said it was the legislature’s job to decide the location and length of criminal sentences.</p>

<p>County sheriffs are paid $40 a day to house the misdemeanor offenders who used to go to state prison. The state pays the Sheriff’s Association $1 million a year to administer the program.</p>

<p>Guilford County, the state’s third largest, is one of the few jails to offer drug treatment. Maj. Chuck Williamson of the county sheriff’s office said 12 months has been the longest sentence served in the two jails and prison farm he oversees. Guilford County may boast the most programs of any jail, but Williamson said jails aren’t designed to handle long-term stays. There’s no law library. Training and education programs are limited.</p>

<p>“You can’t go outside,” he said. “If we saw someone with a three- or six- year sentence here, we’d probably be up in arms.”</p>

<p>Hewett’s problem with alcohol and driving dates to 1997, when the 18-year-old refused a Breathalyzer test at a traffic stop in Brunswick County, which sits on the Atlantic coast at the southeastern corner of North Carolina. He racked up three DWIs through 2013 and became eligible for Laura’s Law.</p>

<p>In February 2017, he pleaded guilty to two additional counts of DWI. Six days later, he was arrested for a third DWI. When he appeared in court in May to plead guilty to all three, he admitted that he was under the influence.</p>

<p>Judge James Bell gave him the maximum: three three-year terms to be served back to back. Bell ordered substance abuse treatment, which the jail does not offer.</p>

<p>Bell said his hands were tied. The law requires all people convicted of misdemeanors to go to jail.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to be easy on the drunk driving cases because the community wants to be tough on them,” Bell said. “Nine years at the jail is tough.”</p>

<h2 id="trumpjusticeyearonethedemolitionderby">Trump Justice, Year One: The Demolition Derby</h2>

<p>Illustration by Rune Fisker</p>

<p>On criminal justice, Donald J. Trump’s predecessor was a late-blooming activist. By the end of President Barack Obama’s second term, his administration had exhorted prosecutors to stop measuring success by the number of defendants sent away for the maximum, taken a hands-off approach to states legalizing marijuana and urged local courts not to punish the poor with confiscatory fines and fees. His Justice Department intervened in cities where communities had lost trust in their police.</p>

<p>After a few years when he had earned the nickname "Deporter-in-Chief," Obama pivoted to refocus immigration authorities — in effect, a parallel criminal justice system — on migrants considered dangerous, and created safeguards for those brought here as children. He visited a prison, endorsed congressional reform of mandatory minimum sentences and spoke empathetically of the Black Lives Matter movement. He nominated judges regarded as progressives.</p>

<p>In less than a year, President Trump demolished Obama's legacy.</p>

<p>In its place, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has framed his mission as restoring the “rule of law,” which often means stiffening the spines and limiting the discretion of prosecutors, judges and law officers. And under President Trump’s “America first” mandate, being tough on crime is inextricably tied to being tough on immigration.</p>

<p>“I think all roads in Trump's rhetoric and Sessions’ rhetoric sort of lead to immigration,” said Ames Grawert, an attorney in the left-leaning Brennan Center’s Justice Program who has been studying the administration’s ideology. “I think that's going to make it even harder for people trying to advance criminal justice reform because that's bound up in in the president's mind, in the attorney general's mind, as an issue that they feel very, very passionately on -- restricting immigration of all sorts.”</p>

<p>Here are nine ways Trump has transformed the landscape of criminal justice, just one tumultuous year into his presidency.</p>

<p>Words matter, and Trump’s words were a loud, often racially charged departure from the reformist talk of being “smart on crime” and making police “guardians, not warriors.” His response to a New York City terrorist truck attack last year reflects the new tone:</p>

<p>“We...have to come up with punishment that's far quicker and far greater than the punishment these animals are getting right now,” Trump said. “They'll go through court for years. And at the end, they'll be — who knows what happens. We need quick justice and we need strong justice — much quicker and much stronger than we have right now. Because what we have right now is a joke and it's a laughingstock. And no wonder so much of this stuff takes place.”</p>

<p>The president’s rhetoric seemed to trickle down. Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for governor of Virginia, adopted what many call “Trumpism” during his fall campaign, vilifying Democrat Ralph Northam as being soft on crime. His ads accused Democrats of restoring the voting rights of a child pornography collector — targeting one man out of the 168,000 former felons who had had their voting rights restored.</p>

<p>In a hotly contested Alabama senate race, Trump accused the Democrat — a prosecutor who had won convictions against two Klansmen who helped plot the 1963 church bombing that killed four black girls — of being “soft on crime.”</p>

<p>While both of the Republicans lost, prisoner advocates worry the discourse has resparked irrational fears and will spook conservatives who have in recent years joined the reform movement. And Trump has not limited his target set to Democrats. He has attacked members of his own party, like Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, as “weak on crime and border.”</p>

<p>Of all the moves Sessions made in 2017, none brought as much consternation from all sides of the political spectrum — from the Koch brothers and Rand Paul to the ACLU and Cory Booker — as this: he revoked the Obama-era instruction to federal prosecutors to be more flexible in charging low-level, non-violent offenders. Under this policy, federal prosecutions had declined for five consecutive years and, in 2016, were at their lowest level in two decades, according to the Pew Research Center.</p>

<p>Sessions ordered prosecutors to seek the maximum punishment available, prompting widespread fear of a return to the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the federal prisons filled with drug offenders. In what it is calling a budget cut, the Bureau of Prisons has also ordered the closure of several halfway houses, which can extend the length of time soon-to-be released prisoners are spending behind bars.</p>

<p>The administration has also cast doubt on the prospect of legislation aimed at reducing mandatory minimum sentences and encouraging diversion to drug treatment and mental health care. Governors and advocates who boast of success at reducing state prison populations — notably in red states — met with the president and son-in-law Jared Kushner on Jan. 11 to plead for similar measures in the federal system, but the discussion was largely confined to rehabilitating the incarcerated rather than incarcerating fewer people in the first place. While sentencing reform seems to be fading, there appears to be progress toward a Kushner-led crusade that calls on churches and private businesses to mentor prisoners upon release and help them find jobs and housing. Trump may also look to cut regulations such as licensing requirements that prohibit applicants with felony records from some lines of work.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most consistent theme of his young administration is that immigrants, especially immigrants of color, are a danger. From the Mexican “rapists” to the “shithole countries” of the third world, the president has played to a base that believes — evidence to the contrary — that immigrants bring crime and displace American workers.</p>

<p>Deportation orders have surged. The Department of Justice said in early December that total orders of removal and voluntary departures were up 34 percent compared with the same time in 2016. Actual removals have not kept pace — in fact, they were at their lowest level since 2006, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University — but it is clear the Trump administration is ramping up ways to deport undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>The declared ending of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program was met with wide consternation from Republicans and Democrats, and is being fought out in courts and bipartisan political negotiations. Trump has given mixed signals as to whether the DACA recipients, brought into the U.S. illegally as children, get to stay, and at what political price. But in the meantime he has ordered an end to protection of refugees from Haiti (at least 60,000) and El Salvador (at least 200,000) who were granted temporary legal status under a bill signed by the first President Bush. And just the other day Sessions limited the power of immigration judges to close complicated cases, a move that could lead to thousands more deportations.</p>

<p>The immigrants-as-menace meme recurs in the argument over “sanctuary cities,” where officials have declined to help in the roundup of the undocumented. Sessions has threatened to withhold federal policing funds from uncooperative venues, so far unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>Sessions’ first major action of 2018 was to issue a memo reminding federal attorneys that marijuana remains an illegal drug under federal law, no matter how many states have legalized the use of marijuana for recreation (8) or for medical use (29). Sessions has pointed to drugs as a major cause of violent crime, often stating in his speeches that drug dealers don’t file lawsuits to settle drug debts but collect “with the barrel of a gun.” Rescinding a 2013 order that gave states tacit approval to legalize marijuana, he drew fire from the left (the ACLU called it a “regressive agenda”) and the right, where some critics called it a violation of states’ rights. se Meanwhile the opioid crisis rages on. For the second straight year, life expectancy in the United States declined in 2016 because of drug overdose deaths. In October the Trump administration labeled the epidemic a public health emergency but fell short of allocating significant federal funds to fight the crisis. He seems to think, contrary to informed opinion, that the answer to heroin smuggling is a border wall.</p>

<p>Police reform, at least the federal enthusiasm for it, died a sudden death in 2017. The Department of Justice has shown no interest in continuing to seek consent decrees or court orders requiring police departments that have been found to have violated civil rights to reform their practices. A voluntary process known as collaborative reform, where police departments could seek the Justice Department’s expertise to improve its relations and performance with communities, was killed off.</p>

<p>Instead, Sessions has pledged his unwavering support for law enforcement, and in speeches has blamed “divisive rhetoric,” meaning the protests of groups such as Black Lives Matter, for violence against law officers. “So it can come as no surprise when we see rising levels of violence against law enforcement,” Sessions told the National Fraternal Order of Police last year, overlooking the fact that the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty last year dropped to its second-lowest level in more than 50 years.</p>

<p>Civil rights advocates were alarmed by a leaked FBI report on “black identity extremists.” Groups such as the NAACP worry that such labels will be used to discredit anyone protesting police abuse or illegal uses of force — like, to cite a favorite presidential target, NFL players taking a knee or raising a fist against police violence.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice has not backed away from prosecuting individual police officers for abuses. Most notably, last month prosecutors secured a 20-year sentence for former Charleston, S.C., police officer Michael T. Slager after he pleaded guilty to civil rights violations in the killing of Walter Scott in April 2015.</p>

<p>In another rollback of an Obama move to discourage police excess, Sessions in August removed federal restrictions on what is known as the “1033 program” allowing state and local law enforcement agencies to request surplus Defense Department equipment for police officers. The program had come under fire in 2014 as Ferguson, Mo., police had used hulking armored vehicles to control crowds during unrest precipitated by the police killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown.</p>

<p>Months later, Obama issued an executive order that prohibited police from acquiring DOD issue bayonets, tracked armored vehicles and grenade launchers. Police say the equipment is necessary as they are facing greater threats and more firepower from terrorists and active shooters while also contending that the value of items such as bayonets has been misconstrued.</p>

<p>But others, including former law enforcement officials, say police should be working harder to make inroads with communities and not be presenting as occupying forces on tanks.</p>

<p>The private prison industry saw a quick turnaround with the election of Trump. In August 2016, former interim Attorney General Sally Yates signaled a phasing out of the federal government’s use of private prisons in light of a shrinking prison population and a scathing inspector general’s report on conditions. Nearly six months later, Sessions reversed Yates’ order, saying it “impaired” the Bureau of Prisons’ ability to meet future needs.</p>

<p>Stock prices for Geo Group and CoreCivic, two of the country’s largest private prison operators, more than doubled after Sessions’ announcement.</p>

<p>It soon became clear that the federal government plans for private prisons were meant for immigration detention, said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, author of Inside Private Prisons: An American Dilemma in the Age of Mass Incarceration. More than 60 percent of immigration detention beds are operated by private prisons.</p>

<p>Arrests along the southern border of the United States have actually decreased, Eisen said, most likely because people looking to breach the border have been scared away by the government’s aggressive policies. Much of the immigration enforcement and detention is occurring in the interior of the country, which private prisons view as a “boon” for the industry, Eisen said. ICE is proposing five new private detention centers in cities such as Detroit, Chicago, St. Paul, Minn., and Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>Obama’s first attorney general, Eric Holder, opposed capital punishment, and President Obama had misgivings. Donald Trump has been a death-penalty enthusiast since at least 1989, when he bought full page ads demanding capital punishment after the rape of a jogger in Central Park.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the Department of Justice has indicated that it will seek the death penalty in two federal cases. Executions at the state and federal levels have been on the wane over the last several years. The last time a federal prisoner was put to death was 2003. Public support for the death penalty, meanwhile, remains at its lowest level since 1972, according to a Gallup poll.</p>

<p>The mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999 was seen as a turning point in the public tolerance of gun violence, but after last year it doesn’t even rank among America’s 10 deadliest mass shootings in modern history. On Oct. 1, 58 victims were killed and more than 500 injured outside the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas. A month later 26 people were killed and 20 more were injured in the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas. i For an instant, it seemed as if this time Congress might pass some type of gun control measure. The National Rifle Association even took a rare stance, saying the ‘bump stock’ that had basically transformed the Las Vegas shooter’s semi-automatic weapons into automatic rifles should be regulated. But as soon as there were bills that sought to do so, the organization opposed them, saying the legislation was overreaching and that the ATF should review bump stocks to see if they comply with federal law.</p>

<p>Once again, any talk of gun control was dead. On the contrary, Republicans and the NRA are pushing a law that would require all states to recognize a gun owner’s concealed carry permit. The bill passed the U.S. House in December.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, Trump, while a hero to the NRA, has not been great for gun manufacturers. Gun sales dipped last year. It seems sales soared when owners were afraid Obama would be coming after their weapons.</p>

<p>“The NRA and the industry used Obama to scare gun owners into thinking the President and the federal government were going to come after their guns or otherwise severely restrict gun purchases,” said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. “Obama would regularly talk about gun control and the NRA and industry would twist it into a move to come after folks’ guns. There may be some saturation of the market post-Obama and few have fears of serious gun control under Trump and a Republican Congress.”</p>

<p>If there is one area where Trump has made the greatest and most lasting impact, it’s the judiciary.</p>

<p>The confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as a justice of the Supreme Court may be Trump’s most conspicuous prize, but it’s the lower courts the president has been busily stacking with conservative nominees. Six of his appointees have been confirmed to the federal district court while he has filled the appellate court with 12 new judges. More than 100 federal judgeships remain to be filled by the end of his term. Given the ages of Justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg, 84, and Anthony Kennedy, 81, Trump could get at least one more chance to appoint a Supreme Court nominee.</p>

<p>The Trump administration is also helping to enrich the court system. In December, Sessions informed court systems across the country that he was revoking a letter the Justice Department had sent out in 2016 that urged court systems to be cognizant of court fees and fines and defendants abilities to pay them. The letter outlined what it called constitutional principles, instructing court systems not to jail indigent defendants who were unable -- not unwilling -- to pay fees and fines and to consider alternatives.</p>

<p>In revoking the letter, as well as several other Obama-era guidelines, Sessions said he was stopping yet another overreach of government power. He said Congress sets the fees and fines and any instruction to sidestep that was “improper” and “unnecessary” guidance.</p>

<p>For all the rollbacks Trump has instituted, reforms are continuing at the state level -- even in states like Louisiana once considered the world’s “prison capital.” In 2017, 19 states passed 57 pieces of bipartisan reform legislation, according to the ACLU.</p>

<p>Here are some of the changes states instituted in their penal systems last year, according to the Pew Public Safety Performance Project, which works with states on reforms:</p>

<p>R</p>

<p>Louisiana</p>

<p>Louisiana lowered mandatory minimum sentences, extended parole eligibility and removed some crimes from violent crime classification.</p>

<p>r</p>

<p>Utah</p>

<p>Utah allowed families to monitor low-level juvenile offenders rather than remove them to state custody, strengthened supervision and treatment for youth and lowered time under state supervision or custody for some juvenile crimes. </p>

<p>C</p>

<p>Arkansas</p>

<p>Arkansas required crisis intervention training for law enforcement, allowed for the creation of mental health crisis stabilization units and changed rules to decrease jail time for technical or misdemeanor probation violations. </p>

<p>J</p>

<p>Georgia</p>

<p>Georgia limited probation terms to end supervision sooner for good behavior, and reduced the number of probationers. </p>

<p>Z</p>

<p>Montana</p>

<p>Montana reduced mandatory minimums for theft and drug offenses and created early probation discharge opportunities for those judged low risk. </p>

<p>b</p>

<p>North Dakota</p>

<p>North Dakota allowed agencies to prioritize prison and jail admissions if facilities exceed capacity, expanded behavioral health services, expanded probation use, established medical parole for people with terminal conditions and repealed the denial of food stamps for people with certain drug convictions. </p>

<p>m</p>

<p>Rhode Island</p>

<p>Rhode Island established a batterer’s intervention program, expanded the type of expenses crime victims can be reimbursed for and increased the statute of limitations to file claims, granted judges more discretion. </p>

<p>Some states are welcoming back ex-offenders to work behind bars. </p>

<p>In 2010, Cindy Stubbs was nearing the end of a 14-year sentence in a South Carolina prison, determined never to return. A mother of four, locked up on gun and drug trafficking charges since she was 34, Stubbs worked inside the prison translating textbooks to Braille. Three months before her release, she caught a break: a telephone interview at another Braille plant, in North Carolina, led to a job offer.</p>

<p>But there was a catch. This plant was also in a prison. She’d be managing prisoners, returning every weekday to exactly the sort of place she’d spent years waiting to leave.</p>

<p>“At the beginning, it wasn’t easy,” said Stubbs, now 55. “Some people in society feel when someone is able to come out of prison and make a good salary and a good position, they don’t feel like you are deserving of it.”</p>

<p>She is one of a small number of former prisoners who have returned to penitentiaries as employees after their release. At least 30 states have policies to allow such hiring, though they do not necessarily track how many they have brought aboard. But a few agencies are beginning to formalize programs, with the explicit goal of reducing the stigma that can follow ex-prisoners as they look for jobs.</p>

<p>Cynthia Stubbs, a Braille transcription services plant manager, helps Daniel Beverly as he transcribes a textbook to Braille at Scotland Correctional Institution in Laurinburg, N.C.</p>

<p>Justin Cook for The Marshall Project</p>

<p>In December, a new law began allowing the Michigan Department of Corrections to hire those it has released, after the agency openly promoted the idea.</p>

<p>“We knew that as we were going out every day talking to the business community and asking them to hire our parolees, that it would be hypocritical if we wouldn’t hire them ourselves,” DOC spokesman Chris Gautz said.</p>

<p>In the many states that allow such hiring, there can be myriad restrictions. Most do not allow ex-prisoners to be correctional officers. Texas largely limits hiring to certain positions, such as substance abuse counselors and contract construction workers, and some sex crime convictions are disqualifying. California bans ex-prisoners from jobs that involve access to personal or medical information of other staff and inmates. Minnesota makes them wait a year after release, and Wyoming won’t let them work in the same facility where they served until five years after release.</p>

<p>Many states don’t track how many ex-prisoners they have hired, but those that do aren’t reporting big numbers; Arizona said they have had hired “at least 11” ex-prisoners.</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections changed its policies in 2016 and sent its own recruiters to job fairs for ex-prisoners, but none applied. (Karena Parks, who runs the agency’s human resources bureau, thinks it’s only a matter of time.)</p>

<p>It might not just be the restrictions. “I was very apprehensive,” said David Van Horn, the first ex-prisoner hired by the New Mexico Department of Corrections in 2015 as part of a new “Returning Citizen Program.” He was released on parole after spending 20 years in prison for killing 68-year-old Norma Clouse in an arson attack after he “abused and terrorized” her and her husband, according to legal records, and then shot two law enforcement officers.</p>

<p>Opening Statement </p>

<p>He was hired to work in a kitchen, in a cafeteria that feeds officer cadets. The response to his hiring illustrated the political obstacles programs can face: the family of Van Horn’s victim was outraged. “Burning somebody alive is one of the worst things you can do to a person,” said Clouse’s brother, John Bailes, noting that he was not informed of Van Horn’s parole or hiring before they happened. “He’s supposed to find his own job and housing.”</p>

<p>The corrections union noted Van Horn’s starting salary would be $17 an hour, more than rookie officers, though as a contract worker he’d be paying higher taxes. “He’s going to be interacting with the same inmate population he served with, while earning four more bucks an hour than the officers who protected him,” union chapter president Robert Darnell said in a press release. “It’s a bridge too far.” Van Horn said his pay was dropped to $15 by the administration, which did not respond to a request for comment. He is no longer in the job.</p>

<p>Other corrections officer unions around the country have expressed similar concerns. In Michigan, a union newsletter said the new policy was met “with mixed feelings and some confusion.” Spokeswoman Anita Lloyd said in an interview that the union is more comfortable with the formerly incarcerated working in rehabilitation programs.</p>

<p>Ex-prisoners who have returned have said they can serve as role models for the people still inside. “I really want them to know there is hope out there,” said Larry Vene, who served more than four years in Washington state for producing methamphetamine. He learned to be a wastewater treatment plant operator while inside, and then returned to the department in 2013 to train current prisoners. “They listen to me because I’ve lived what they’re living.”</p>

<p>For Stubbs, who still manages 22 prisoners at the Braille plant in a North Carolina prison, the biggest shift was mental. Interacting with other staffers in her new job, she said, her mindset was “stay behind the yellow line” and “yes, sir” and “no, sir.” One day an administrator shook her by the shoulders. “She said, ‘You are not an inmate anymore’,” Stubbs said. “It took me a minute to adjust.”</p>

<p>Like Vene, she enjoys being a role model for her employees, but her past also gives her a nose for trouble. Before opening, she identified every hiding place in the office, filled with cubicles, bookshelves and computers. She knew which inmates to hire: avid readers with no “disobeying orders” violations in their jackets.</p>

<p>Six months after opening, an inmate asked how she knew so much about prison. She told her story. “My history is an encouragement to them,” she said, “but they also know I do this for a living, and I don’t put up with any foolishness.”</p>

<h2 id="howsocialmediagiantssidewithprosecutorsincriminalcases">How Social Media Giants Side With Prosecutors in Criminal Cases</h2>

<p>by: Andrew Cohen</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-14</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/01/15/how-social-media-giants-side-with-prosecutors-in-criminal-cases </p>

<p>You probably would not be surprised to learn that Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media companies readily hand over their customers’ online content to cops and prosecutors who come armed with a court order or search warrant. But you may be surprised to learn that lawyers for those same social media giants say a federal law forbids them from sharing similar information with defense attorneys looking to help their clients.</p>

<p>The conflict is coming to a head in a California case that will test whether the law — the Stored Communications Act — conflicts with the constitutional rights of criminal defendants. The law, which was passed in 1986, bars companies from “knowingly” sharing information with anyone but the sender and the intended recipient.</p>

<p>The California Supreme Court is poised to hear arguments that come down to defining “privacy” on social media, a platform that was never considered by the authors of the federal law and is by its very nature public. Companies argue that defense attorneys should get the information from the government, which can obtain a court order to secure it, or better yet, from the people whose accounts they want to mine. Defense attorneys argue that no one should have to jump through those sorts of hoops to get a fair trial.</p>

<p>The case began with a murder. On June 24, 2013, Jaquan Rice was killed in a drive-by shooting at a bus stop in San Francisco. Prosecutors theorized the shooting was gang-related. A 14-year-old boy confessed to the crime, telling police he shot Rice, 19, because he believed Rice would have killed him first if he had a chance. The boy said Rice had tagged him in violent posts on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>The teen implicated his other brother, Derrick Hunter, in the murder, saying he also had been in the car as it rolled up to the bus stop. Another man, Lee Sullivan, also was implicated. His ex-girlfriend, Reneesha Lee, had rented the car and was found by police driving in it, alone, a few minutes after the shooting. She told cops that Sullivan was involved. Defense attorneys said she did this only after she was threatened with prosecution for whatever role she may have played in the crime.</p>

<p>The boy was eventually convicted in juvenile court. As the case against the two adult defendants moved toward trial in December 2014, defense lawyers subpoenaed Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, to get records from the social media accounts of Rice, the victim, and Lee, the witness. The strategic reason for doing this is obvious: if Rice or Lee had threatened anyone online, defense attorneys surely would want jurors to know.</p>

<p>The tactical reasons for the subpoenas also are clear. Rice was dead and could not consent to a search of his online accounts. Lee had fled to parts unknown; she could not be found either by defense attorneys or prosecutors. Before she left, however, she was called as a witness in the juvenile’s murder proceeding and invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. If the defense attorneys for Sullivan and Derrick Hunter were going to get access to these records, it was going to have to come from the companies or prosecutors, who say it’s not their job to help the defense get its evidence.</p>

<p>The companies were unmoved by the fact that Rice and Lee could not or would not consent to the release of their online profiles. Lawyers for the companies immediately moved to quash the subpoenas, saying that the Stored Communications Act allows the disclosure of private social media information only under a warrant or court order, both of which require a judicial finding of probable cause. A month later, in January 2015, the trial judge dismissed the companies’ motion, ruling that the defendants had a constitutional right to the social media records before trial and ordered the companies to provide them. The judge planned to review them privately.</p>

<p>Become a Member </p>

<p>The companies quickly appealed. In September 2015, the appeals court issued its ruling: even if the defendants’ fair trial rights trumped the Stored Communications Act, those rights didn’t kick in at the pretrial stage of the case. They would have to wait until trial.</p>

<p>That result didn’t satisfy either side. Now, the case is before the California Supreme Court waiting for oral argument. There are two central issues for the justices to consider. The first is whether the act, as applied in this case, is unconstitutional because it undermines the ability of the defendants to put on their case. The second is whether the law itself, outdated almost from the moment it was enacted, even contemplated a scenario where social media posts are considered “private” communications.</p>

<p>The prosecutors have stayed out of this fight, which is rare in battles over pretrial discovery in criminal cases. Perhaps they don’t need the social media records the defendants are requesting. No doubt they chafe at one of the arguments made by the companies, that prosecutors should serve as agents for defense attorneys by obtaining social media records that defense investigators cannot otherwise obtain. In an adversarial trial system prosecutors don’t want to do that any more than defense attorneys want prosecutors to do their pretrial investigative work for them.</p>

<p>A lawyer for Facebook told me he could not comment on the pending case and directed me to Facebook, which did not respond to my request for comment. Janelle Caywood, who is representing Sullivan in the case, told me last week that Silicon Valley is relying on a cramped interpretation of the Communications Act that puts her clients and others in an impossible position: Defense lawyers have no right to ask prosecutors or cops to obtain a search warrant in order to hunt down evidence favorable to their clients, she said. But even if they did, they would have to tell prosecutors what they were looking for — which would violate attorney-client privilege.</p>

<p>Depending on what those social media accounts show, the high court’s decision could mean the difference between a conviction and an acquittal or hung jury for the defendants. But there are broader implications in the case that have drawn the attention of outside groups. The folks at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit digital rights group, intervened in a 2013 case with similar facts. That case was resolved before it was fully litigated. In that instance, the EFF argued that any requests for online information should be made to the user and not to third parties such as Facebook (a scenario, as we’ve seen, that would not work in the case of Rice and Lee).</p>

<p>The tech companies, meanwhile, continue to rely on a federal statute that was enacted when Mark Zuckerberg was 2 years old and the notion of Facebook, Twitter and Instagram weren’t even twinkles in the eyes of today’s social media giants. Are the posts of Rice and Lee, the ones the defense attorneys want access to today, really “private” if they once were shared, as they presumably were, with the friends (and friends of friends) of Rice and Lee? If nothing else, the corporate argument here makes the strongest case for amending and updating the Stored Communications Act to fit the more modern world.</p>

<p>For more than 300 days, Mariana Cuevas's son was held in a Contra Costa County, Calif., juvenile hall for a crime he did not commit. She was then billed nearly $10,000 for his incarceration. Biz Herman</p>

<p>A California county will issue refunds to parents wrongly billed for their kids’ incarceration. </p>

<p>One California county is giving its citizens something that’s not typically on offer from the U.S. justice system: a refund.</p>

<p>This week, the Contra Costa County probation department will begin notifying and mailing checks to families who, since 2010, were wrongfully billed for their children’s incarceration.</p>

<p>The county, located to the east of the Bay Area, will pay back a total of $136,000 — with interest — to about 500 mostly low-income families. It has also wiped out more than $8.5 million of outstanding debt in about 11,000 other cases.</p>

<p>“It’s not easy for government to look at a practice, admit it was wrong, and make a refund, but it’s the right and moral thing to do,” said John M. Gioia, a member of the county’s Board of Supervisors, which made its decision on the issue in December.</p>

<p>Until last year, California state law allowed counties to bill parents for the cost of their children’s incarceration, a common policy nationwide that has recently come under wide criticism. The Marshall Project wrote about the practice in March, and in October, Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown banned it statewide.</p>

<p>Even under the previous law, California parents were not supposed to be billed if their son or daughter was ultimately found not guilty. But most counties either did not know about the provision or did not follow it.</p>

<p>Billing parents for the cost of their children’s incarceration is rooted in a decades-old belief among policymakers that families are responsible for supporting their delinquent children and should not expect government to pick up the tab. But critics have challenged the policy around the country, arguing it is akin to taxing parents for a child’s loss of liberty.</p>

<p>In California, advocates began fighting the fee system locally in 2016, winning moratoriums in several counties, including Contra Costa. Philadelphia also stopped the practice last year, soon after The Marshall Project story.</p>

<p>Contra Costa appears to be the only California county to take the additional step of discharging all outstanding debt and repaying parents who had been improperly billed.</p>

<p>Probation officials there have spent the past several months going through more than 3,000 payment accounts, searching for parents who were billed even when their child was not guilty. They are now mailing form letters to the last known addresses of those families, notifying them of the refund effort.</p>

<p>Life Inside </p>

<p>There will also be a claims process for parents who believe they were unfairly assessed the fees earlier than 2010 or for reasons other than innocence. This could include cases in which indigent families were billed without an adequate way for them to demonstrate their income level, which was also required by the old law.</p>

<p>“You never like to lose revenue, but this was a real hardship for folks — and we’re able to absorb the cost of paying them back,” said Todd Billeci, the chief probation officer in Contra Costa.</p>

<p>Some activists, though, believe the Board of Supervisors has not gone far enough.</p>

<p>Rebecca Brown, director of Reentry Solutions Group, a criminal justice advocacy organization that spearheaded the effort to get the fees banned and the money paid back, says the county is getting off easy. She points out that only the “wrongfully” billed parents are getting repaid, even though California law now says the whole payment system is illegal. And the probation department is refunding accounts only going back to 2010, before which it says it does not have adequate records.</p>

<p>“The real reason that the county wants to claim the records don’t exist is that it opens the door to a) a lot of work and b) a much bigger pool of potential reimbursements,” Brown said. “The message is that justice reform isn’t that important in itself and shouldn’t actually cost the government anything.”</p>

<p>News of the refund was bittersweet for Mariana Cuevas, whose story The Marshall Project reported last year. Her son was imprisoned more than 300 days for a crime he did not commit, but she was nonetheless billed nearly $10,000 for his detention, most of which she was not able to pay.</p>

<p>Cuevas, a house cleaner in the city of Antioch, spoke at the county meeting in December when the decision to issue refunds was made.</p>

<p>“Money for people who are working to survive can never be too late,” she said in an interview.</p>

<p>But her son was still wrongfully jailed for all those months. “It doesn’t fix it,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="thedoctorssayimokbutthentheresthispain">The Doctors Say I’m O.K, But Then There’s This Pain…</h2>

<p>by: Rahsaan Thomas</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-03</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/01/04/the-doctors-say-i-m-o-k-but-then-there-s-this-pain </p>

<p>A fretful prisoner struggles with an ever-growing list of symptoms. </p>

<p>This article was published in collaboration with Vice.</p>

<p>"Again?" replied my cellie, Jay, after I asked him to step out for the third time in 90 minutes so l could use the toilet.</p>

<p>"My doctor says it's normal," I insisted.</p>

<p>Actually, I don't feel normal. I'm always tired, no matter how much sleep I get. Last week, I nodded off at a meeting — even though I was outside and standing up.</p>

<p>My mouth and eyes always feel dry, despite my drinking 100 ounces of water a day. My bowel movements, according to what I learned on an episode of Dr. Oz, could indicate cancer. (I don't have internet access, so yeah, I watch Dr. Oz for medical advice on a personal 15-inch TV.)</p>

<p>Sometimes, I wake up in the middle of the night with cramps in my calves. I occasionally get electric shock-type feelings in my toes. I have sciatica that never fully healed, and there is a bump on the base of my lower spine that stinks. Plus I have Raynaud’s disease, which means less blood circulates to my fingers and toes when it gets cold.</p>

<p>Also, my blood pressure charts around 88 over 65, though the nurses say that's a good thing.</p>

<p>The doctors who work for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation say my problems aren't life threatening or even medical. All my blood and urine tests read normal, so they think my issues are mental, maybe caused by depression.</p>

<p>In so many words, the doctors have called me a hypochondriac.</p>

<p>I don't feel like a hypochondriac, though. Yeah, maybe I am a little depressed, but who in prison isn't? That's the nature of this place — it's sad. But it's also unhealthy: The prison largely serves and sells processed foods, and they keep us in cages.</p>

<p>How can I eat like this for over a decade, sleep on a thin mattress over a metal bunk, and still be healthy?</p>

<p>Or maybe I am paranoid. I remember how it felt to walk past the poster in North Block, the one that had the faces of the men who died here from old age or natural causes, all within the same year. As I stood before them, noticing how young some were, I thought about what it would be like to die with the last thing I saw being prison bars, guards, and my failures.</p>

<p>Any one of those men could have been me. I am 47, with at least another 13 years to serve. I, too, could die behind bars, alone, 3,000 miles from my family back home in New York.</p>

<p>That’s why I need to know if I’m crazy or if medical is missing something. I need answers, whether for peace of mind or to save my life. But how do I get information from inside this system?</p>

<p>I have complained about my slowly worsening health issues since 2003. With every new symptom, I file a request to see the doctor and jump through hoops to get an appointment. At least seven of them have said the same thing: I'm healthy. I don't believe it, though, because I don't trust the system to care about the quality of life of a man convicted of murder.</p>

<p>I don't want to end up like the guy in West Block in 2015. They say he went to medical complaining of chest pains. He was sent back to his cell. Hours later, we heard he died of a heart attack.</p>

<p>I also need to take care of myself to have some kind of quality of life on the outside. I want to go home able to make up for missing my sons’ whole lives — by being the best grandfather ever. I will teach my grandchildren how to play basketball while my boys take their wives to see Broadway shows I’ve bought them tickets to. I don't want to endure decades of miserable conditions just to die among strangers who don't care about me — or go home with a chronic condition just to be a continuing burden on my family.</p>

<p>I saw on Dr. Oz that cleanses help, so I tried one with the only food I had access to that qualified: apples. For three days, I held up the line on the way out of the chow hall, stopping by the kitchen worker passing out the fruit. Ignoring strange looks from fellow inmates, I took away four apples at a time.</p>

<p>I had to stretch out the apples through each day, watching the minutes tick by until my next scheduled snack. It was voluntary torture.</p>

<p>At the two-and-a-half-day mark, they served hamburgers in the chow hall, and I decided to forget Dr. Oz and bite into some meat.</p>

<p>Commentary </p>

<p>I felt lighter after the two days of cleansing, but all my symptoms remained. Next, following my doctor's advice, I went to see the mental health department, hoping to rule out hypochondria.</p>

<p>On the day of my appointment, I checked in with the officer at the desk.</p>

<p>“Have a seat," he said.</p>

<p>I went over to a knee-high metal bench and sat in a room packed with men. I thought to myself, Damn, there are a lot of people seeking mental health help in here… I felt like I was at the DMV.</p>

<p>After about 15 minutes, an older lady with short hair and brown eyes called my name. I followed her through a maze of corridors to a small office, where she signaled me to sit in one of two chairs.</p>

<p>"So your doctor referred you here," she said.</p>

<p>"Yeah, they think I'm a hypochondriac."</p>

<p>"Why do they think that?"</p>

<p>I told her. We talked for about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>She asked about my family, my job, my general feelings and my odds of going home. I told her that my mother just visited in July, my writing career was going well, and, with upcoming changes in the law, I could be home earlier than expected. My only complaint was being incarcerated.</p>

<p>She said it sounded like I had a mild case of depression. She advised coming back to mental health to see someone on a regular basis.</p>

<p>I agreed, albeit while disappointed that getting to the bottom of this wouldn't happen in a day, and headed back to my cell.</p>

<p>"What they say at mental health?" Jay asked.</p>

<p>"They said I'm not crazy."</p>

<p>Jay laughed and said, "I guess you have to use the bathroom."</p>

<p>"My doctor says it's normal," I replied, and we both laughed.</p>

<p>The next day, after jumping down off my bunk, I noticed that the bottom of my left foot hurt. I sat down on the toilet, took off my sock and looked at it, and saw a purple growth under the skin.</p>

<p>This time I didn't report the problem.</p>

<p>Rahsaan Thomas, a 47-year-old inmate at San Quentin State Prison in San Quentin, Calif., is a contributing writer to The Marshall Project. He is serving a 15-year-to-life sentence for second-degree murder, with a 35-year enhancement for using a firearm. He shot and killed two men he says were armed and stealing property from him.</p>

<h2 id="themarshallprojectanddiversity">The Marshall Project and Diversity</h2>

<p>by: </p>

<p>date: 2018-01-03</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/01/04/2017-diversity-report </p>

<p>This is the first of what will be an annual report on diversity at The Marshall Project.</p>

<p>The Marshall Project is committed to building and maintaining a diverse workforce, and not only because our name is a tribute to a hero of equal justice. We best serve our audience by bringing a variety of experiences and vantage points to bear on the issues we cover. We regard diversity as integral to our overall responsibility, which is to produce the best possible journalism about the U.S. criminal justice system, with its disproportionate impacts on communities of color.</p>

<p>When The Marshall Project launched in November 2014, two of our eight staff writers were people of color, but the leadership was entirely white and predominantly male. We realized that we needed to take steps to broaden representation, and began work to systematically improve our diversity profile.</p>

<p>We have created an active staff diversity committee to guide our efforts. We have expanded opportunities at The Marshall Project by establishing three paid summer internships and, starting this year, two year-long fellowships; we have made a concerted effort to use these jobs as points of entry for talented young journalists of color, including collaborating with the Chips Quinn Scholars Program for Diversity in Newsrooms to identify top candidates. Over the past two years, we also have worked with the Knight CUNY program, which places students from historically black colleges and universities and schools with significant Latino populations in media internships. We make sure that job openings are posted on the websites of the major black and Latino journalist associations. We promote The Marshall Project to journalism students at historically black universities. We staff a career booth at the National Association of Black Journalists convention and lead workshops there on deep-dive reporting; in 2018 we are attending the National Association of Hispanic Journalists convention.</p>

<p>These efforts have borne fruit. As of a staff survey in November 2017, the third anniversary of our launch, 12 of 29 employees (41 percent) identify as people of color, including nine of 21 members of the newsroom team (43 percent). Women make up 55 percent of the full staff and 48 percent of the newsroom, including the president and managing editor. (See a detailed breakdown below.)</p>

<p>We will continue to put a premium on diversity as we recruit, hire and promote, including for leadership positions. We will continue to seek out experienced journalists of color, but we will also do more to add to their ranks in the industry at large. The Marshall Project is committed to building internships and fellowship programs to bring young journalists of color into our newsroom and provide the training and mentoring they need for their talents to blossom.</p>

<p>In a highly competitive market for diverse talent, we at The Marshall Project have some disadvantages when it comes to diversifying our newsroom. We are small, relatively new, and focused on a single subject, making us less attractive to some candidates. Additionally, the talent pool for investigative reporting, our specialty, is discouragingly white.</p>

<p>But we also have some advantages: we cover a subject that disproportionately affects communities of color and matters profoundly to everyone. We have acquired a measure of prestige. And we are united—staff and board—in our commitment to diversity.</p>

<p>Below is a breakdown of race, ethnicity and gender at The Marshall Project as of November 2017. It is based on a newsroom of 21, and a total staff of 29. The count includes full-time fellows, but not interns.</p>

<h2 id="whattoknowaboutthedeathpenaltyin2018">What to Know About the Death Penalty in 2018</h2>

<p>by: Maurice Chammah</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-02</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/01/03/what-to-know-about-the-death-penalty-in-2018 </p>

<p>Only a little more than a year ago, many opponents of the death penalty were cautiously optimistic that the U.S. Supreme Court — perhaps with a Clinton appointee or two — might strike down the punishment for good. Then came President Donald Trump, who tweeted “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!” about one criminal suspect and recently called for the execution of anyone who kills a police officer. He picked an attorney general, Jeff Sessions, known for his efforts to pursue executions in Alabama, and a Supreme Court justice, Neil Gorsuch, whose first major decision was to deny a prisoner’s request for a stay of execution.</p>

<p>But does all that matter? The number of executions and new death sentences have been trending downward for years. Support for capital punishment in the U.S. is at about 55 percent, its lowest point in more than four decades. Trump’s first year saw a slight rise in death sentences and executions, but those are the product of counties and states; the president and attorney general have little say beyond the occasional federal case.</p>

<p>What can we expect at the beginning of 2018? Is the death penalty almost gone, or will the president’s support rejuvenate it?</p>

<p>To answer those questions, there will be four places to watch:</p>

<p>Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg in Houston in 2017.</p>

<p>The Counties</p>

<p>It’s up to local, elected district attorneys to decide whether to ask a jury for the death penalty. In the 1990s, many prosecutors campaigned on their successes sending men to death row. But much has changed. In the last two years, voters elected district attorneys in Denver, Philadelphia, and Orlando, Fla., who all promised to stop seeking the death penalty completely. In Orlando, the move prompted a backlash, as Florida Gov. Rick Scott removed potential death cases from new DA Aramis Ayala’s authority; she sued, lost, and rescinded the death penalty ban.</p>

<p>In Houston and Tampa, newly elected DAs made vaguer pledges: they said they would be more judicious about which cases merit the death penalty. Inevitably, there will be high-profile crimes in these communities, and many — perhaps inspired by the president — will call for harsh punishments. It will be worth watching these prosecutors handle the new cases that cross their desks.</p>

<p>As the death penalty disappears, it has been replaced by life without parole, a punishment that California prisoner Kenneth Hartman once called "death by another name.” In Texas alone, between 70 and 100 people are sentenced to life without parole each year — far exceeding death sentences there. Keep an eye on prosecutors who spare prisoners from execution to see if they send even greater numbers to prison for life.</p>

<p>The Next To Die </p>

<p>The States</p>

<p>It takes a DA and a jury to send someone to death row, but it takes a massive state bureaucracy to kill him. Courts must uphold the convictions, prison officials must secure lethal injection drugs, and governors and attorneys general must clear political and legal obstacles.</p>

<p>In recent years, executions have become even more difficult to carry out because drug companies have protested the use of their products in lethal injections. States have searched for new sources and combinations of drugs, and defense lawyers have fought these new plans in court.</p>

<p>Eight states managed to clear these obstacles and carry out executions in 2017. The result was more executions than the year before, when only five states pulled it off.</p>

<p>But numerous other states have made moves to obtain lethal injection drugs and revive their death chambers. In 2018, we will see if they succeed, or whether opponents are able to hold them off through litigation. Nebraska and Nevada are both trying new drug combinations that feature fentanyl, the opioid responsible for thousands of accidental deaths in recent years.</p>

<p>This is an area where Trump could have an effect. In Arizona, Nebraska, and Texas, efforts to import execution drugs from India have been stymied by the federal Food and Drug Administration. Trump could push the agency to let the drugs in, paving the way for many states to seek drugs abroad.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court</p>

<p>Trump could leave a massive legacy at the Supreme Court, especially if Justice Anthony Kennedy follows through on his plan to retire. This would affect many areas of the law, including the death penalty. Kennedy has been a swing vote in the court’s efforts to ban its use on the intellectually disabled and people who committed their crimes before age 18.</p>

<p>Death row prisoners are likely to find less success under a Trump-nominated successor, but some observers have pointed to Chief Justice John Roberts as a potential swing vote on capital cases. Recently, he rejected the death sentence of Duane Buck, whose trial featured testimony from an expert witness that suggested he was more likely to be dangerous because he is black. "Some toxins can be deadly in small doses,” Roberts wrote of that testimony. The court is currently considering whether to hear a challenge to the Georgia death sentence of Keith Tharpe. A juror from his trial used the n-word and “wondered if black people even have souls.” Still, as with Buck, a victory for Tharpe would not have a broad effect on capital punishment as a whole.</p>

<p>For that, look to Abel Hidalgo, whose Arizona case the justices are currently considering whether to hear. Hidalgo was convicted of the 2000 murders of two men at an auto repair shop; he was paid $1,000 by a gang that wanted one of the men dead. His lawyer, Neal Katyal — a former solicitor general under Obama, who also represented the state of Hawaii in a challenge to Trump’s travel ban — has asked the Supreme Court to consider whether the death penalty as a whole is unconstitutional. That is a long shot, given that the court has chosen to avoid the question several times in recent years.</p>

<p>But Katyal has also given the court an opportunity to take a more modest challenge. Most states with the death penalty have laws that say only certain “aggravating” factors can qualify a murderer for the punishment. Katyal argues that in Arizona there are so many aggravating factors that practically any murder qualifies. If the court takes the case, it could cast into doubt the future of the death penalty in a state where 120 people are on death row.</p>

<p>Another potentially important case — which Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said he’s watching — comes from Missouri, where a man was sentenced to death last year by a trial judge after his jury deadlocked 11-1. Missouri is one of only two states, along with Indiana, where judges are allowed to break such a deadlock. But two years ago, the Supreme Court ruled in Hurst v. Florida that judges cannot be the primary decider behind a death sentence. Perhaps, as this case is appealed, it also will land in front of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The U.S. Attorney General</p>

<p>The federal government has successfully sought capital punishment 76 times since 1988. It will become clear in 2018 whether Sessions will try to impose capital punishment in some current cases. As attorney general of Alabama in the 1990s, he oversaw the state’s efforts to move cases toward execution. But during his confirmation hearings, he said he had dropped the death penalty in an Alabama case when he learned it did not meet the legal criteria, weathering political attacks for the decision. (He did not specify the case.) The Department of Justice has a bureaucratic process for determining whether to seek death, and it will be up to Sessions to decide whether to overrule the decision brought to him.</p>

<p>Obama oversaw several federal death sentences — most famously those of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Dylann Roof — but no executions. The federal government, much like the states, has not been able to obtain lethal injection drugs. Sessions could prioritize the issue and seek a revival of the federal execution chamber.</p>

<p>Finally, there is one way he could speed up executions in the states. People sent to state death rows can appeal to federal courts, and in 1996, Congress set a one-year deadline for these appeals. Former Marshall Project reporter Ken Armstrong investigated in 2014 how lawyers frequently missed the deadline, leading to their client’s executions.</p>

<p>But a little-known provision of that law offered states the opportunity to push the deadline back even further — to six months — and also force federal courts to rule more quickly. The provision has been tied up in a lengthy legal battle, but it will eventually be up to Sessions to decide if states can speed up appeals. “I suspect it hasn't been a priority in this very tumultuous first year of the Trump Administration,” said Kent Scheidegger of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in California, who supports the changes. “But it will go forward at some point.”</p>

<h2 id="hownewyorkcouldchangethegameforitscriminaldefendants">How New York Could Change the Game for Its Criminal Defendants</h2>

<p>by: Beth Schwartzapfel</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-03</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2018/01/03/how-new-york-could-change-the-game-for-its-criminal-defendants </p>

<p>After decades of criticism from defense attorneys and others, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday he would push to change New York’s “blindfold law,” which allows prosecutors to withhold evidence against a criminal defendant until just before trial.</p>

<p>“We need discovery reform,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said in his annual State of the State address. He announced the effort as part of a larger package of proposed changes to the criminal justice system, including eliminating cash bail for low-level crimes.</p>

<p>New York is one of 10 states where prosecutors can wait until a trial to turn over witness names and statements, grand jury testimony and other evidence known as discovery, which backs up criminal charges. In a front-page New York Times story this summer, The Marshall Project reported that the practice gives prosecutors a strategic advantage, especially because the vast majority of cases never make it that far: More than 98% of New York felony arrests that end in conviction occur through a guilty plea, not a trial. Defendants often plead guilty without ever knowing the strength of the case against them.</p>

<p>New York lawmakers have introduced bills to open up the process at least a dozen times in the last 25 years, but the measures have faced powerful opposition from the state’s district attorneys. Prosecutors argue that turning over details of witnesses puts them at risk for intimidation and worse.</p>

<p>The District Attorneys Association of the State of New York and its president, Oneida County District Attorney Scott McNamara, did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday.</p>

<p>Opening Statement </p>

<p>John Schoeffel, staff attorney at The Legal Aid Society, called Cuomo’s support “the biggest thing to happen on discovery reform in 40 years.” The state’s discovery law has not been significantly updated since 1979, and this is the first time Cuomo has come out publicly in support of revising them. In 2015, a New York State Bar Association report called the current system “outdated and unfair.”</p>

<p>As is typical for a State of the State address, the governor did not offer many specifics. A press release accompanying the speech said he intends to introduce legislation requiring prosecutors to turn over information, including exhibits, the identity and backgrounds of witnesses and search warrant information, in stages. That would happen within three months after a defendant is arraigned, The New York Times reported Wednesday.</p>

<p>The release also said the plan will take steps to protect witness safety.</p>

<p>The measures are part of a larger proposed package of changes to the criminal justice system that include eliminating cash bail for misdemeanors and non-violent felony charges, and speeding up the trial process. In New York City in particular, defendants can languish in jail for months and years waiting for their day in court.</p>

<p>Cuomo’s support follows a trend toward more open discovery nationwide. Ohio broadened its laws in 2010. Traditionally more conservative states such as Texas and North Carolina have made sweeping changes to their discovery laws. And the American Bar Association, whose standards often serve as models for state laws, has convened a task force to update its criminal discovery standards for the first time in more than 20 years.</p>

<h2 id="reimaginingprisonwithfrankgehry">Reimagining Prison with Frank Gehry</h2>

<p>“I’ve personally spent only one night in jail,” Frank Gehry confessed. “I didn’t like it very much.” Gehry, 88, who has been described as our greatest living architect (and, by an admiring pro-cannabis website, as a Very Important Pothead), said he got his only taste of incarceration when he was busted for possession many years ago. Last Friday in New Haven, that night behind bars was a kind of credential. An invited audience of architects and students, corrections officials and campaigners for criminal justice reform assembled at the Yale School of Architecture for the finale of Gehry’s semester-long “studio” on architecture and mass incarceration. A dozen students would present their projects — designs for a humane prison — to a jury consisting mostly of Friends of Frank.</p>

<p>Gehry, best known for the billowing contours of his concert halls and museums, has never designed a prison, unless you count the episode of “The Simpsons” in which a Gehry concert hall is converted to a state prison when the town of Springfield discovers it hates classical music. He admitted to approaching the subject with some trepidation.</p>

<p>“It’s heavy stuff, and I’m going to be 89, and it’s a little late,” Gehry told me during a lunch break. “I’m on the learning curve with everybody else.”</p>

<p>The billionaire philanthropist George Soros put up the money for the student workshop and a like-minded research and advocacy group called Impact Justice managed the logistics.</p>

<p>“We asked Frank, what would it mean to design a maximum security prison if you treated the corrections officers and the prisoners as the clients instead of the state bureaucracy,” said Christopher Stone, the outgoing president of Soros’s Open Society Foundation, who served as a juror. [OSF is a supporter of The Marshall Project.] “Frank kept saying, 'You don’t need me to design a prison. Nobody’s going to build a prison I design. We need to get a curriculum. We need to get architects thinking in different ways.'”</p>

<p>Yale, one of Gehry’s several academic affiliations, offered to host it. Connecticut, where Governor Dannel Malloy is a prison reform enthusiast, invited the class to tour the 104-year-old, 1,600-bed Cheshire Correctional Facility about 20 miles north of New Haven.</p>

<p>That site, students were told, was to be “re-imagined to house three hundred men convicted of serious, primarily violent offenses, serving sentences between five and 15 years... The speculative nature of the project, based on contemporary research and theory, requires you to examine closely the role of architecture as a means to provide safety, refuge, and facilitate personal transformation...’’</p>

<p>The premise of the assignment was that only the most dangerous offenders will need to be confined if American prison populations are reduced to the levels in other developed countries, and even those incarcerated for violent crimes should be equipped with the skills and social discipline to rejoin society.</p>

<p>During the semester, Gehry accompanied the class to prisons in Norway and Finland, where sentences for even the most heinous crimes rarely exceed 15 years and where prisons resemble college dormitories. Susan Burton, an activist who was in and out of jails as a young woman and now helps women released from prison find their feet, brought in parolees to educate the class about the grim reality of incarceration in America.</p>

<p>As students laid out their cardboard models for inspection and pinned up their master plans, it was clear most had ignored the part about “men convicted of serious, primarily violent offenses.” They presented prison as university campus, prison as health and wellness facility, prison as monastery, prison as communal apartment complex, prison as summer camp, prison as textile workshop (complete with a mulberry orchard to feed the silkworms). Virtually every student incorporated classrooms, open space and fresh air, spaces for family visits and therapy.</p>

<p>It fell to a formerly incarcerated juror, Dwayne Betts, to point out gently that neighbors might have security concerns about a prison where walls were decorative features and staying on site was more or less optional.</p>

<p>“You seem to be designing prisons for people who shouldn’t be in prison,” Betts, who served eight years for a teenage carjacking and emerged to become a lawyer and poet, told one student.</p>

<p>In an episode of "The Simpsons," a Frank Gehry-inspired concert house proves unpopular when the residents of Springfield discover they hate classical music. Mr. Burns buys the hall, and repurposes it as a prison.</p>

<p>Fox</p>

<p>But the point was not to design things that would actually be built. It was to establish that there are public interests and human values other than retribution that ought to be reflected in the system we euphemistically call "corrections." A society where prisons resemble cages and warehouses has lessons to learn from monasteries and college campuses.</p>

<p>“It’s a lot more theoretical,” Gehry said. “A studio in architecture is to unlock students’ feelings about form and space and time, and how that relates to people. A prison program happens to be more emotional for them,” he said. “And for me.”</p>

<p>One guest who watched the presentation with particular interest was Elizabeth Glazer, director of the New York City Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice, which is overseeing the closure of the notorious Rikers Island complex and restoration of jails in several boroughs. Unlike prisons, jails are designed for short stays — the average at Rikers is 60 days — but many of the challenges are the same: preventing violence, easing access for families and lawyers, attending to mental health and addiction, and fitting the facilities into the neighborhoods around them. Glazer said she was struck that the student projects treated prison as not just a place for rehabilitation but as a “civic asset.”</p>

<p>“You look at the jails that we currently have and they don’t feel like a part of our urban landscape,”she said. “Either we’ve put them far away, like Rikers, or we’ve made them forbidding, like the Tombs.”</p>

<p>“Even though we may not be building those fabulous Gehry-like designs in our jails, the principles are something we need to pay very close attention to. We should try to normalize life inside as much as we can, because people are going to come back.”</p>

<p>This past year was a little … tumultuous, and the world of criminal justice was no exception. When President Donald Trump took office, he and Attorney General Jeff Sessions quickly began undoing much of their predecessor’s efforts. Meanwhile, state legislatures and district attorneys offices made changes big and small to sentencing laws, prison policy and policing. Take our quiz to see how well you remember the big criminal justice stories of 2017. And if your score is less than stellar, you might want to sign up for our morning newsletter, Opening Statement. Our senior editor Andrew Cohen will make sure you’re up to speed on all things crime and punishment in 2018.</p>

<p>Opening Statement </p>

<p>A Tennessee judge went viral this summer when he offered defendants a reduced jail sentence if they did what?</p>

<p>Got a vasectomy</p>

<p>Cleaned his chambers</p>

<p>Judge Sam Benningfield implemented a policy last spring that shaved 30 days off the sentences of drug defendants who underwent a vasectomy or another form of long-term birth control. “I hope to encourage them to take personal responsibility and give them a chance, when they do get out, to not to be burdened with children,” he told reporters. Benningfield had to withdraw the offer after it was derided by public health and civil rights advocates.</p>

<p>Data released in July by the U.S. Sentencing Commission found what percent of federal inmates in 2016 were convicted of an offense carrying a mandatory minimum — a set minimum sentence that a judge has no choice but to impose?</p>

<p>22 percent</p>

<p>56 percent</p>

<p>83 percent</p>

<p>45 percent</p>

<p>The report found that the number of federal inmates convicted under mandatory minimum laws fell by 14 percent from 2010 to 2016 — but they still accounted for more than half of the Bureau of Prisons population.</p>

<p>Advocates and stars including Jay-Z called on a Pennsylvania judge to #FreeMeek when rapper Meek Mill was sentenced to 2 to 4 years in prison for what crime?</p>

<p>Violating probation</p>

<p>Marijuana possession</p>

<p>In 2008, Mill was given eight months in prison and five years probation for gun and drug charges — though the length of his probation kept getting extended. In November, a Philadelphia judge sent him back to prison for two arrests: one for a fight (the charges were dismissed), and one for popping a wheelie on set for a music video. “For about a decade, he’s been stalked by a system that considers the slightest infraction a justification for locking him back inside,” Jay-Z wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a memo in May to all federal prosecutors. What did it instruct them to do?</p>

<p>The memo was a departure from the “Smart on Crime” efforts put in place by former Attorney General Eric Holder, which told federal prosecutors to use discretion when deciding which offense to charge.</p>

<p>This summer, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to close Rikers Island, the infamous city jail. What timeline did he give for closing the facility?</p>

<p>Within a year</p>

<p>By the end of his term</p>

<p>15 years</p>

<p>10 years</p>

<p>de Blasio released his plan in June to close Rikers within a decade and reduce the city’s average daily jail population by 25 percent. City activists and the governor’s office criticized the plan for being too slow and passing the responsibility on to future mayors.</p>

<p>What state slipped a law into its budget that intends to make it virtually impossible for judges to waive court fees and fines for poor people?</p>

<p>Mississippi</p>

<p>Kansas</p>

<p>North Carolina</p>

<p>Alabama</p>

<p>The Republican-controlled legislature included a law in the state budget that requires judges, before waiving fees or fines, to give 15 days notice to four state agencies and more than 600 local agencies that receive part of the funds. The new law doesn't prohibit waivers, but judges say it creates a bureaucratic logjam that makes them all but impossible. No legislator has taken credit for the law.</p>

<p>Which city elected a civil rights lawyer who sued the local police department 75 times to be its next district attorney?</p>

<p>Chicago</p>

<p>New York</p>

<p>Philadelphia</p>

<p>Raleigh, N.C.</p>

<p>Civil rights attorney Larry Krasner won the city’s general election in November, taking over for former D.A. Seth Williams after he was found guilty of corruption. Krasner has been called “the attorney for Black Lives Matter” and opposes the death penalty, stop-and-frisk and civil asset forfeiture. The city’s activists were thrilled, the city’s police officers were not.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump told a group of sheriffs in February that he would “destroy [the] career” of a state legislator who wanted to do what?</p>

<p>End the death penalty</p>

<p>Reform stop-and-frisk</p>

<p>Sheriff Harold Eavenson of Rockwall County, Texas, told Trump about a state senator who proposed that a criminal conviction be required before law enforcement could seize someone’s assets. “Can you believe that?...Do you want to give his name? We’ll destroy his career,” Trump told the sheriff, to laughter. The sheriff did not identify the lawmaker.</p>

<p>In October, Attorney General Jeff Sessions complained about rampant fraud and abuse that had mounted to “a crisis.” He said that “dirty” lawyers had “gamed” the system by “exploiting loopholes.” What “system” was he talking about?</p>

<p>The asylum process</p>

<p>The federal death penalty</p>

<p>Sessions said in a speech at the Executive Office of Immigration Review that “the credible fear process was intended to be a lifeline for persons facing serious persecution. But it has become an easy ticket to illegal entry into the United States.” He called for stricter enforcement against “baseless” asylum claims, and raising the threshold of what constitutes a credible fear of returning to one’s home country.</p>

<p>In Packingham vs. North Carolina, the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to ban sex offenders from what?</p>

<p>Social media</p>

<p>The internet</p>

<p>Pet adoption</p>

<p>Going to church</p>

<p>The Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision that North Carolina’s ban was a violation of First Amendment rights. The state had prosecuted more than 1,000 people for violating the rule, including petitioner Lester Packingham, who was indicted after posting on Facebook about his experience in traffic court.</p>

<p>In November 2016, voters in Harris County elected new District Attorney Kim Ogg, who promised to use the death penalty more sparingly. The county was responsible for more executions over the past 40 years than any entire state other than Texas.</p>

<p>He was approved for parole</p>

<p>He was denied parole</p>

<p>The Nevada state parole board voted unanimously in July to release Simpson from prison a few months later. “I basically have spent a conflict-free life,” he told the board. He served nine years for his involvement in a 2007 Las Vegas hotel robbery.</p>

<p>The reach of #fakenews is long. It’s the word of the year in Norway. Strongmen all over the globe now use it to wave away criticism. Here at home, it’s the 6 a.m. rallying cry of a president. At The Marshall Project, we believe in the power of journalism, now more than ever. We spent 2017 on ambitious video, deep investigations and powerful narratives. Rigorous. Based in fact. Nothing fake.</p>

<p>We’ve gathered some of our best work from 2017 below, and we hope you’ll continue watching us in 2018. Thanks from all of us.</p>

<p>The impact of America’s punishment policies is often measured in numbers: There are now 2.2 million people in our jails and prisons; our inmate population is four times larger than it was in 1980. The far-reaching video series We Are Witnesses offers a different calculation, the human cost of locking up so many of our citizens — from the perspective of the people ensnared.

<p>The criminal justice system can be so Kafkaesque that it’s a cliche to call it Kafkaesque. But it’s hard to find another word to describe the ordeal of Jerry Hartfield, who was held in a Texas prison for decades without a trial. Senior Editor Andrew Cohen’s regular “Case in Point” column detailed the series of misunderstandings, miscommunications and procedural squabbles by lawyers, judges and jailers who all thought Hartfield was someone else’s problem.

<p>After every homicide, police and prosecutors have to determine whether to file murder charges. If the killing was found to be in self-defense, it is called “justifiable.” Anna Flagg and Daniel Lathrop’s unprecedented analysis of more than 400,000 homicides between 1980 and 2014 showed significant racial disparity in those decisions: killings of black men by white people are labeled justifiable more than eight times as often as others. Partner: The Upshot, The New York Times</p>

<p>Since 1989, more than 200 people have been freed from prison after being cleared of a sex crime against a child, often because the children recanted their testimony. In The Accusation, Maurice Chammah takes us inside the lives of two children whose father went to prison for 19 years on their word, exploring what it’s like to grow up in the shadow of a false conviction and what it’s like to try to rebuild. Partner: Esquire</p>

<p>Money can buy a lot in the criminal justice system: release on bail, a rigorous defense, an easier outcome. In California, it can buy a better jail experience. Reporters Alysia Santo and Anna Flagg teamed up with with Los Angeles Times reporter Victoria Kim to analyze thousands of records in a first-ever examination of people who have been able to upgrade their jail experience — for a price — in the state’s two-tiered justice system. Partner: The Los Angeles Times</p>

<p>In addition to our reported work, The Marshall Project runs commentary from all perspectives on the criminal justice system. In his piece, Paul Butler, a Georgetown University law professor, argues that the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation’s largest police association, has become “regressive and anti-accountabilty with deadly consequences for communities of color” and should be disbanded. Partner: The Nation</p>

<p>Seeing your child jailed is bad enough, but in dozens of states and countless localities, parents are also handed a bill for the cost of incarceration, even if the child is eventually found innocent, Eli Hager found in his report. The practice, a legacy of get-tough-on-crime policies and shrinking budgets, is slowly starting to change. Partner: The Washington Post</p>

<p>A gun goes off. Someone dies. But who should get the blame? In cases where multiple people are charged, prosecutors are allowed to argue conflicting theories of a crime in order to get the highest possible conviction for everyone. Courts remain split on whether this is fair. Reporter Ken Armstrong dug up four dozen instances where the truth is still an open question. Partner: The New Yorker</p>

<p>Military experience has long been considered a door to a career in law enforcement; one in five officers are veterans, prized for their discipline and training. But what happens when cops bring the war home? Simone Weichselbaum and Beth Schwartzapfel show that the prevalence of military veterans can also complicate relations between police and the communities they are meant to serve. Partner: USA Today</p>

<p>In 10 states, prosecutors aren’t required to turn over discovery — the evidence backing charges in a case — until just before trial. Because the vast majority of cases end in a plea deal, many defendants never learn what the state has against them. Beth Schwartzapfel took a close look at New York, where there is a new movement to change the rules. Partner: The New York Times</p>

<p>The easy availability of child pornography and the inability of some people with autism to understand the children are victims has led to a troubling and complex collision between the justice system and a developmental disability that, despite its prevalence, remains largely misunderstood in courts across the country. Reporter Anat Rubin looked at the toll taken on families.</p>

<p>The planet is getting warmer, and for thousands of prisoners in hot climes with no air conditioning, there is no escape. More than 20 Texas prisoners have died from the heat since 1998. The head of the state correctional officers union put it best in this story by Maurice Chammah and an accompanying short documentary with John Carlos Frey: “The incarceration is their punishment, not cooking them to death.” Partner: The Weather Channel</p>

<p>When tens of thousands of women and children fled Central American violence to the U.S. beginning in 2014, the Obama Administration funneled them into the court system to seek asylum. Now those cases are getting to court — and most families are not showing up, fearful of being swiftly sent home. Reporter Julia Preston shows that some 70 percent of the cases heard so far are ending up with orders of deportation issued in empty courtrooms. Partner: The Washington Post</p>

<p>Alysia Santo and Eli Hager revisited their award-winning 2016 investigation into private prisoner transportation vehicles by examining another death this year in the poorly regulated industry.

<h2 id="whatschristianintheseasonoftrump">What’s Christian in the Season of Trump?</h2>

<p>by: Justin George</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-06</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/12/07/what-s-christian-in-the-season-of-trump </p>

<p>At the small home gatherings that are a center of evangelical Christian life across the United States, the topics of discussion range from the previous Sunday’s sermon to the latest Christian spiritual help book, from marriage to addiction to the Bible’s diet guidance.</p>

<p>Add to the list: mass incarceration.</p>

<p>Prison Fellowship, the nonprofit prisoner advocacy group, has created “Outrageous Justice,” a small-group study guide intended to transform more evangelicals into political evangelists for criminal justice reform.</p>

<p>Heather Rice-Minus, vice president of government affairs for Prison Fellowship.</p>

<p>The push to influence evangelical Christians comes at a confusing juncture. The campaign to ease sentencing for nonviolent crimes and to expand rehabilitation has moved forward at the state level, led by Republicans and Democrats alike. But at the federal level such initiatives have stalled. President Donald Trump, who has called for “stronger” criminal punishment, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has linked leniency to rising violent crime, have caused a slowdown on reform measures President Obama enthusiastically supported.</p>

<p>Heather Rice-Minus, vice president of government affairs for Prison Fellowship, concedes the current climate makes it harder to persuade Christians — 81 percent of white evangelicals cast ballots for Trump — to consider reducing mandatory minimum sentences, increasing prisoner education programs and reforming other areas of the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>“In some ways it’s more difficult because of the law-and-order narrative that’s promoted, but at the same time I’m hopeful,” she says.</p>

<p>“Outrageous Justice” is a six-session plan designed to be spread across six weeks. The first week, participants would discuss how they can “pursue justice that restores” in the criminal justice system. By the sixth week they are considering whether the members are ready to accept ex-prisoners into their communities.</p>

<p>“Once someone has made amends for their past wrongdoing and repented, are we willing to extend a hand in practical ways?” the study guide summary asks. “Are we, who have been given a second chance, willing to give similar opportunities to others who only want to reach their full potential?”</p>

<p>Small groups are a more informal, modern and intimate version of the traditional Sunday or Wednesday night Protestant prayer service. The gatherings in church members’ living rooms are occasions to strengthen friendships, to share snacks, Biblical inspiration and prayer requests.</p>

<p>Rice-Minus said about 375 groups have tried the study guides. The initial feedback has been so enthusiastic that Prison Fellowship has set a goal of producing a million copies.</p>

<p>“People are having this awakening in America to injustice, whether it be sentencing or in conditions in confinement or after people pay their debt,” said Prison Fellowship’s Craig DeRoche, senior vice president for advocacy and public policy.</p>

<p>Jera Thompson joins in a group discussion in Wichita, Kan. Craig Hacker for The Marshall Project</p>

<p>Christian perspectives on criminal justice teeter between harsh punishment and grace. A poll of 1,000 Protestant pastors last year found them evenly divided on the question of whether the recent growth of prison populations is “unjust.” Another survey commissioned by Prison Fellowship in June asked Christians if it was acceptable for someone to be punished more severely than their crime deserved in order to send a message. Fifty-three percent said yes.</p>

<p>Such a belief is inconsistent with Biblical values, Rice-Minus said. Many passages call on Christians in the spirit of Hebrews 13:3: “Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering.”</p>

<p>Christians have always understood “direct mission,” helping prisoners one-on-one, but Prison Fellowship hopes “Outrageous Justice” will teach the need for “system change,” such as improved prison conditions, additional reentry programs and legislative fixes for unfair sentencing guidelines.</p>

<p>In a sense, “Outrageous Justice” is a reaffirmation of the fellowship’s roots. The organization began as a lobby for freedom of worship in prisons, founded by Charles “Chuck” Colson, President Richard Nixon’s general counsel who became a Christian as pressure and despair mounted during the Watergate scandal, which led to Colson’s imprisonment. Rice-Minus said she wanted a modern-day study guide to be interactive and use updated terminology that would engage millennials.</p>

<p>Prison Fellowship launched the program with backing from the Charles Koch Institute, a conservative think tank that has developed prison entrepreneurship programs and had “a shared recognition that the faith community is an important voice in the call for justice reform,” Rice-Minus said.</p>

<p>The study guides were designed by a consultant that has helped put together other small-group guides, including the popular “Daniel Fast,” a diet based on the Bible’s account of the prophet’s eating habits. (Low on meat and carbs, good for the body and spirit.) The authors called it “Outrageous Justice,” Rice-Minus said, because there are “so many outrageous things happening in our justice system today that are unfair and don’t make sense. Then if you think about God and the second chances He gives us (even when we don’t deserve it), that’s outrageous justice in a powerful and positive way.”</p>

<p>Evangelicals have demonstrated their grassroots influence on issues such as abortion and the campaign by Christian-led companies to be exempt from the Affordable Care Act’s coverage of contraception.</p>

<p>Rice-Minus argues that transforming the criminal justice system “is about the sacredness of life, just like the pro-life issue is,” Rice-Minus said.</p>

<p>But so far, except for black churches and pastors who have protested alleged police bias, abuse and harassment, they have not mobilized on criminal justice issues.</p>

<p>Marc Levin, policy director for the conservative reform group Right on Crime, said churches can energize the criminal justice reform movement. Polls have shown that the issue is popular with voters, Levin said, but they’ve also shown that it’s not a high priority when compared with the economy and tax reform.</p>

<p>While an array of advocates have energized the left and kept issues such as police misconduct and jail abuse out front, no similar grassroots movement has arisen on the Christian right.</p>

<p>“On the left there’s been this explosion of grassroots energy,” Levin said, “and if we don’t have a similar force on the right I think there’s a danger in some areas where just the rhetoric can come to look at this as just a left-wing issue.”</p>

<p>Steven Harris, policy director for the Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission, the public-policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, said evangelical churches are beginning to think about criminal justice issues holistically rather than just how it affects individual people. Issues such as the opioid crisis and protests over police brutality and bias are confronting them every day in their churches or on the news.</p>

<p>They are asking themselves: “What does my faith require of me at this moment?” Harris said. “How as a Christian should I be thinking about justice?”</p>

<p>African-American churches have been on the forefront of these discussions, but Harris said white Christians — who make up three-fourths of all evangelical Protestants — have started to consider their role, as well.</p>

<p>The Southern Baptist Convention, the nation’s largest Protestant denomination, has supported measures to divert more nonviolent offenders to parole or probation and to provide incentives for inmates to join education programs behind bars.</p>

<p>In June, the convention joined several faith groups and Prison Fellowship in signing the “Justice Declaration,” which urged Christians to support "proportional punishment," to care for crime victims and minister to prisoners’ families.</p>

<p>Harris said small groups such as “Outrageous Justice” are good methods to “sensitize” evangelicals to criminal justice issues.</p>

<p>Rice-Minus hosted a small “Outrageous Justice” group herself in January, inviting friends and families she knew from her interdenominational Washington, D.C., church. Her parents in North Carolina FaceTimed into the group. The results were transformational, Rice-Minus said.</p>

<p>Her mother now volunteers with a group that teaches and mentors women being released from prison.</p>

<h2 id="howhardisittocountviolentcrimes">How Hard is it to Count Violent Crimes?</h2>

<p>by: Yolanda Martinez</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-08</p>

<p>url: https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/12/08/how-hard-is-it-to-count-violent-crimes </p>

<p>The government tries to measure crime in many ways, including the latest survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics released Thursday. The National Crime Victimization Survey is meant to estimate how many people in the U.S. are victims of crime each year.</p>

<p>Like many crime studies, the survey is imperfect. But this year’s edition had more inconsistencies than most. In an attempt to provide a better picture of crime at the local level, the bureau changed its methodology. What it found when it surveyed new parts of the country, however, was that crime is even more difficult to measure than one might imagine.</p>

<p>The victims survey is an important tool for researchers because a significant percentage of crimes are never reported to police and so are not counted in other measures like the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting program. By asking nearly 225,000 people if they’ve been victims of crime and whether they reported it to the police, the survey tries to fill in the gaps of other measures that can undercount crimes in communities where vulnerable populations do not go to the police for help as often.</p>

<p>But the new version of the survey produced unusual results compared to years past—much higher than expected in newly added areas (24.2 violent crimes per 1,000 people). The bureau cautions against comparing the new figures to numbers in 2015, which had a rate of 18.6, leaving the question of whether or not there is a trend of rising crime rates unanswered.</p>

<p>The BJS “concluded that it was not possible to isolate or quantify—and therefore adequately adjust for—the impact of each factor contributing to the increase in the victimization rates,” the report says.</p>

<p>Despite the limitations of the new survey, researchers believe that the revised methodology could help provide a more granular view of local crime trends in future years that is sorely needed.</p>

<p>Opening Statement </p>

<p>“There has been this long desire from local agencies and researchers to get more data from smaller geographic areas,” says Min Xie, an associate professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Maryland, who has worked with the data. “It’s more information, and it’s very exciting.”</p>

<p>The new victims survey finds that there were 5.7 million violent crimes in the U.S. last year — at a rate of 21.1 crimes per 1,000 people age 12 and older.</p>

<p>Overall, the report found that only 42 percent of violent victimizations were reported to police last year. When looking at the demographics of victims, there is a distinct disparity in the prevalence of crime depending on a person’s marital status. People who are separated were victims of violent crimes at a rate of 67.5 for every 1,000 people, more than double the rate for people who are divorced or even those who have never been married. Separated people also only reported their crimes 43 percent of the time.</p>

<p>The discrepancies can be explained by the tenuous situation people find themselves in when leaving relationships. “People who are separated are at higher risk for intimate partner violence,” says Dr. Alesha Durfee, an associate professor of Women and Gender studies at Arizona State University. “That’s when the batterer is more likely to resort to violence,” says Durfee.</p>

<p>The survey also examines the difference in how people of different races are victims of crime. Last year, people who identify as having two or more races were victims of crime at a rate of 59.8 per 1,000 people, close to triple the overall national average and more than twice the rate for any other group except for American Indians.</p>

<p>by: Justin George</p>

<p>Last year, prospects were looking good for a bipartisan effort in Congress to overhaul federal sentencing. But after long and careful negotiations, one senator almost single-handedly torpedoed the measure: the junior Republican from Alabama, Jeff Sessions.</p>

<p>Sessions, of course, went on to become Attorney General, dimming hopes even further. But Tuesday’s election of his unlikely replacement, Democrat Doug Jones, hands the seat to a former federal prosecutor who has advocated for less harsh sentencing and more alternatives to prison.</p>

<p>“Doug Jones was a groundbreaking voice for prosecutorial reform to end mass incarceration,” said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, senior counsel in the Brennan Center’s Justice Program. “He was one of the first prosecutors to speak out about how prosecutors can and should help reduce unnecessary incarceration.”</p>

<p>Jones, the former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, was best known as a prosecutor for securing the convictions of two former Ku Klux Klan members in the infamous 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, which killed four young black girls. The men were convicted in 2001 and 2002.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, Jones, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday after his victory, has begun to openly push for changes that would give prosecutors more leeway. He included criminal justice among his top campaign priorities, taking aim at mandatory minimum sentencing, disparities that send a disproportionate number of blacks and Latinos to prison, and “three strikes” laws.</p>

<p>“These are bipartisan issues Democrats and Republicans agree on,” Jones told a group of Alabama State University students last month. “Try to reduce the crime, keep our communities safer and at the same time cut down the costs of the criminal justice system.”</p>

<p>In March 2015, Jones wrote an op-ed criticizing Alabama state prosecutors who left Anthony Ray Hinton, convicted of two murders, on death row for 15 years “despite compelling evidence of innocence.”</p>

<p>“All of us are at risk if prosecutors believe their commitment is not to fairness and reliability but to win and defend convictions at all costs,” Jones wrote.</p>

<p>Opening Statement </p>

<p>It’s too soon to tell what Jones’ election means for federal sentencing reform. Progress stalled under President Donald Trump, and Sessions has stayed true to his law-and-order roots, calling on U.S. Attorneys to seek the highest possible charges and rolling back a guideline that had allowed prosecutors to ignore some drug charges. Legislators and advocates instead have focused on trying to create more re-entry programs, prison educational opportunities and job skills training.</p>

<p>But Jones’ election elevates one of the effort’s most vocal supporters.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Jones and another former federal prosecutor, James E. Johnson, and other law enforcement officials formed Law Enforcement Leaders To Reduce Crime &amp; Incarceration, a bipartisan, reform-minded advocacy group. Jones was among members who signed a letter supporting the effort that ultimately died in Congress. One of the bill’s sponsors, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, spoke at a group meeting in February 2016.</p>

<p>“While I sought harsh punishments for violent offenders as U.S. attorney, not all cases require severe sentences,” Jones wrote on his website. “Judges and prosecutors should be given flexibility and be empowered to decide the fate of those before them in the justice system.”</p>

<p>On a tour of civil rights landmarks with his daughter early last year, Johnson said he called Jones when he arrived in Birmingham and told him they were on their way to see the 16th Street Baptist Church. Jones hurried over.</p>

<p>In a navy suit and yellow tie, with sunglasses slung around his neck, Jones pointed to the building’s brick wall as he walked Johnson and his daughter Abigail through the evidence used to convict the Klansman bombers.</p>

<p>By the end of the tour, as Jones shared more about a commitment to civil rights that dated back to high school, Johnson said he felt strongly about one thing. “He is committed to right some of the wrongs of Birmingham’s past and our nation’s past,” Johnson said.</p>
