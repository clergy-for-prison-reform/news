<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday told his fellow Republicans in Congress to "stop wasting their time" on immigration legislation until after the November elections. GOP leaders said they'd press on anyway, but his comments further damaged their attempt to win over wavering lawmakers for a measure already facing likely defeat.</p>

<p>A little more than four months before the congressional elections, Trump also took a new shot at Democratic lawmakers, accusing them of spreading "phony stories of sadness and grief" about young immigrants separated from parents by his "zero tolerance" policy on illegal border crossings.</p>

<p>Trump's tweet on immigration legislation was the latest example of his abrupt reversals on issues, to the dismay of Republicans who crave his backing as a seal of approval for conservative voters. Just Tuesday, he met privately with GOP lawmakers and told them he supported the immigration legislation and would have their backs in November.</p>

<p>"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November," he tweeted. "Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solve this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!"</p>

<p>Trump's history of turnabouts has made it harder for congressional leaders to win over other lawmakers for the immigration bill. The measure would grant young "Dreamer" immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children a chance for citizenship — a move many Republicans worry would enrage conservative voters who'd view it as amnesty.</p>

<p>"You just fear that tweet in the morning," said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a supporter of efforts to help Dreamers. She said members think, "The day's not over. Heck, it's not even noon yet. How many times could he change his mind?"</p>

<p>Despite Trump's stance, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said the chamber would press ahead on legislation next week. Differences between conservative and moderate Republicans delayed a vote initially planned for Thursday.</p>

<p>The bill would also require the government to separate fewer migrant children from parents when they are detained and finance Trump's proposed wall with Mexico.</p>

<p>"I think it's important that the House be able to show we can take the action," said McCarthy, R-Calif.</p>

<p>"We're not giving up," said No. 3 House GOP leader Steve Scalise, R-La.</p>

<p>House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., said he "absolutely" would continue the immigration push.</p>

<p>"I don't think it will affect the mood of members who got very close yesterday and want to continue," he said.</p>

<p>In a private meeting late Thursday, party leaders said they would add provisions to the bill in hopes of rounding up the support they need.</p>

<p>Trump's comments come amid an international outcry over the separation of migrant families at the southern border. Trump asserted Thursday that Congress could provide the "only real solution" to the crisis.</p>

<p>The last ditch effort on immigration ahead of the midterm elections was meant to help vulnerable Republicans this fall.</p>

<p>A measure backed by conservative lawmakers failed Thursday. Hours later Republican leaders postponed final voting on what was billed as a compromise immigration package until next week as negotiators made a last-ditch push for support.</p>

<p>Lawmakers said two new provisions would be added to the bill in hopes of winning votes. One would require employers to use an online system to verify the citizenship of their workers, which could attract conservatives.</p>

<p>The other would make it easier for employers to retain migrant workers, which could bolster support from Republicans from agricultural regions. Legislation on those issues had been promised for July, but skeptical lawmakers wanted it sooner.</p>

<p>Calling Democrats "obstructionists" and accusing them of not caring about border security, Trump tweeted Friday that voters need to elect more Republicans.</p>

<p>"Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill," he said.</p>

<p>Despite the president's prediction of a "Red wave" this fall, Republicans are facing an uphill battle this November as they seek to hold control of the House and Senate. Headwinds from the controversy-embracing president and a wave of retirements in the House have put the GOP majority at risk there.</p>

<p>Democrats face a more challenging map to retaking control in the Senate, with the GOP eyeing pick-ups of seats in states Trump carried in 2016.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus is asking Gov. Phil Bryant to recall the Mississippi National Guard from the U.S.' southern border and refuse to send more troops.</p>

<p>In a hand-delivered letter to the governor's office, the caucus says it does not want any Mississippi troops at the border while the policy to separate families is in effect.</p>

<p>Around 2,300 migrant children have been separated from their families on the U.S' southern border since May 2018. On June 20, President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending the separation of families, creating a policy of family detention.</p>

<p>"While the president's executive order may temporarily pause the separation of families, we urge you to stand with governors across the country who, in a bipartisan manner, refuse to support the enforcement of this inhumane policy of jailing children," the letter says. "We pray you that you agree and Mississippi will stand on the right side of history."</p>

<p>The letter makes a plea to Bryant's understanding as a father and grandfather, asking him to think about the vulnerability of children. It also references the fact that the U.S. is a "nation of immigrants built by the hands of a mixture of races."</p>

<p>Sonya Williams Barnes, chair of the caucus, and 14 other members, a mixture of Senators and Representatives, signed the letter.</p>

<p>"This is not what Mississippi represents," the letter says. "We call on you to take action now."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant is endorsing a prosecutor in a Republican congressional runoff.</p>

<p>Michael Guest of Brandon, who won 45 percent of the vote in a six-person field on June 6, announced Bryant's endorsement Wednesday. The 48-year-old district attorney for Rankin and Madison counties faces Madison Republican Whit Hughes in a runoff Tuesday. Hughes won 22 percent of the vote. The 43-year-old former state development official later worked as fundraiser for a Baptist hospital system.</p>

<p>Republican Bryant says Guest will be a supporter of President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Hughes is criticizing Guest for refusing to debate.</p>

<p>Guest and Hughes are running in the 3rd District in central Mississippi. Current GOP congressman Gregg Harper isn't seeking re-election. The winner faces Democratic state Rep. Michael Ted Evans and Reform Party member Matthew Holland.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The parking lot of Christ United Methodist Church in northeast Jackson looked like the rear of any prison in the state this morning—lined with white Mississippi Department of Corrections vehicles and vans. Hundreds of judges, lawyers, legislators, politicians, corrections officers, re-entry advocates and previously incarcerated people gathered in the church hall for the 2018 Statewide Re-Entry Symposium.</p>

<p>MDOC Commissioner Pelicia Hall hosted the program and introduced the notorious keynote speaker: Richard F. "Dickie" Scruggs. He is a former high-powered trial attorney in Mississippi known for lawsuits against the asbestos and tobacco industries, as well as for suing insurance companies that would not pay out to homeowners after Hurricane Katrina devastation. In 2007, Scruggs pled guilty to conspiracy to bribe Circuit Judge Henry L. Lackey in 2008 and then pled guilty in 2009 to a bribery scheme involving Hinds County Circuit Judge Bobby DeLaughter and former Hinds County District Attorney Ed Peters. Scruggs served six years in federal prison, and was released in 2014. DeLaughter also served time, and Peters got immunity for admitting his role in the scheme.</p>

<p>At the symposium, Scruggs made the crowd laugh, but also shared personal stories from his time in federal prison to underscore how people inside the system view re-entry. The federal system often carries much longer sentences, especially without a parole system. Scruggs talked of fellow inmates adjusting to the prison conditions, and fearing life on the outside, where they have to make decisions for themselves again and perhaps return to the same environments where they landed in trouble.</p>

<p>He also painted the grim reality that without familial support, many returning citizens struggle to successfully re-enter society. Studies back Scruggs up.</p>

<p>"I think when we think of re-entry we want to think of men and women released from prison, reconnecting with their families, getting jobs, going to school, getting back into the American mainstream," Sruggs said. "But many of the people like I served time with have a different view of re-entry: They have by and large ruptured their family relationships. I bet you would be surprised that the typical inmate during the time he is in prison gets two visits. It's not two visits a year; that's two visits the entire time."</p>

<p>Scruggs talked about re-entry programs needing to help at-risk returning citizens mitigate their fears that include going back to the dysfunctional lives they may have led before incarceration.</p>

<p>After being released from prison, Scruggs founded 2nd Chance Mississippi, a nonprofit organization that helps those who did not finish high school obtain a GED and skills-based training to join the workforce. Not all the people in Scruggs' program have been incarcerated.</p>

<p>Mississippi does not often make it easy for returning citizens to become a part of the American mainstream, as Scruggs puts it. There is a list of 22 disenfranchising crimes that permanently prevent Mississippians from voting if convicted.</p>

<p>Matthew Riley, a state re-entry coordinator, recently told the Jackson Free Press that some mid-level employment positions are closed to ex-offenders per state law such as the casinos. Even restaurants or hotels attached to the casinos will deny formerly incarcerated people's job applications.</p>

<p>Riley spoke at the re-entry symposium this afternoon about his 82 counties in 82 days tour across the state in search of employment opportunities for returning citizens leaving the state's corrections system. Some had zero-tolerance policies, refusing to hire formerly incarcerated people. He asks those employers to follow up if they ever have a change of heart. He learned that most supervisors he talked to are willing to give people a second chance.</p>

<p>"The goal was to reach out to the employers ... to develop partnerships to let them know we have individuals that have been released that have credentials," Riley said "... As we talk to these individual employers, we had good response for the most part ... but in some cases I was thrown out the door."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A group of about 30 demonstrators on Monday burned a Mississippi state flag, saying it symbolizes the racism at the heart of the state's problems with poverty, education and health care.</p>

<p>Demonstrators with the Poor People's Campaign burned a Confederate battle flag and then a separate Mississippi state flag Monday in front of the governor's mansion.</p>

<p>Mississippi's flag has contained the Confederate battle emblem since 1894, and residents who voted in a 2001 statewide election chose to keep the emblem on it.</p>

<p>The campaign includes activists in 40 states who are demonstrating, seeking to force communities to address poverty. They say poverty continues to be ignored and only a "moral revival" can bring it to the nation's consciousness.</p>

<p>"This flag needs to come down," said organizer Danyelle Holmes of Jackson. "This flag needs to burn. We're burning the hate out of their hearts. We're burning the hate out of our state."</p>

<p>Monday was the climax of six weeks of demonstrations in Mississippi. Last week, for example, protesters built a cardboard shack symbolizing homelessness with signs calling for better social services and health care for the poor. Holmes, though, said lingering white supremacy is bound up in all of Mississippi's problems.</p>

<p>Confederate symbols have been the subject of widespread debate across the South, particularly since the racially motivated killings of nine African-American parishioners in 2015 at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, and after last year's violent protests at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.</p>

<p>Although flag protests are frequent in Mississippi, burning the banner is rare.</p>

<p>Several city and county governments and all eight of Mississippi's public universities have stopped flying the state flag in recent years amid critics' concerns that it does not properly represent a state where 38 percent of residents are African-American. Supporters of the flag say it represents history.</p>

<p>Republican Gov. Phil Bryant maintains that if the flag is to be changed, another election should be held.</p>

<p>"This is an unfortunate instance of a group exercising their rights in a completely disrespectful and unproductive manner," Bryant said in an emailed statement. "There are better ways to bring attention to one's opinions than burning the state of Mississippi flag on a public street corner."</p>

<h2 id="immigrantkidsseenheldinfencedcagesatborderfacility">Immigrant Kids Seen Held in Fenced Cages at Border Facility</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-18</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/18/immigrant-kids-seen-held-fenced-cages-border-facil/ </p>

<p>In this photo provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, people who've been taken into custody related to cases of illegal entry into the United States, sit in one of the cages at a facility in McAllen, Texas, Sunday, June 17, 2018. Photo by U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Rio Grande Valley Sector via AP</p>

<p>McALLEN, Texas (AP) — Inside an old warehouse in South Texas, hundreds of immigrant children wait in a series of cages created by metal fencing. One cage had 20 children inside. Scattered about are bottles of water, bags of chips and large foil sheets intended to serve as blankets.</p>

<p>One teenager told an advocate who visited that she was helping care for a young child she didn't know because the child's aunt was somewhere else in the facility. She said she had to show others in her cell how to change the girl's diaper.</p>

<p>The U.S. Border Patrol on Sunday allowed reporters to briefly visit the facility where it holds families arrested at the southern U.S. border, responding to new criticism and protests over the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy and resulting separation of families.</p>

<p>More than 1,100 people were inside the large, dark facility that's divided into separate wings for unaccompanied children, adults on their own, and mothers and fathers with children. The cages in each wing open out into common areas to use portable restrooms. The overhead lighting in the warehouse stays on around the clock.</p>

<p>The Border Patrol said close to 200 people inside the facility were minors unaccompanied by a parent. Another 500 were "family units," parents and children. Many adults who crossed the border without legal permission could be charged with illegal entry and placed in jail, away from their children.</p>

<p>Reporters were not allowed by agents to interview any of the detainees or take photos.</p>

<p>Nearly 2,000 children have been taken from their parents since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the policy, which directs Homeland Security officials to refer all cases of illegal entry into the United States for prosecution. Church groups and human rights advocates have sharply criticized the policy, calling it inhumane.</p>

<p>Stories have spread of children being torn from their parents' arms, and parents not being able to find where their kids have gone. A group of congressional lawmakers visited the same facility Sunday and were set to visit a longer-term shelter holding around 1,500 children — many of whom were separated from their parents.</p>

<p>"Those kids inside who have been separated from their parents are already being traumatized," said Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who was denied entry earlier this month to children's shelter. "It doesn't matter whether the floor is swept and the bedsheets tucked in tight."</p>

<p>In Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for people trying to enter the U.S., Border Patrol officials argue that they have to crack down on migrants and separate adults from children as a deterrent to others.</p>

<p>"When you exempt a group of people from the law ... that creates a draw," said Manuel Padilla, the Border Patrol's chief agent here. "That creates the trends right here."</p>

<p>Agents running the holding facility — generally known as "Ursula" for the name of the street it's on — said everyone detained is given adequate food, access to showers and laundered clothes, and medical care. People are supposed to move through the facility quickly. Under U.S. law, children are required to be turned over within three days to shelters funded by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>

<p>Padilla said agents in the Rio Grande Valley have allowed families with children under the age of 5 to stay together in most cases.</p>

<p>An advocate who spent several hours in the facility Friday said she was deeply troubled by what she found.</p>

<p>Michelle Brane, director of migrant rights at the Women's Refugee Commission, met with a 16-year-old girl who had been taking care of a young girl for three days. The teen and others in their cage thought the girl was 2 years old.</p>

<p>"She had to teach other kids in the cell to change her diaper," Brane said.</p>

<p>Brane said that after an attorney started to ask questions, agents found the girl's aunt and reunited the two. It turned out that the girl was actually 4 years old. Part of the problem was that she didn't speak Spanish, but K'iche, a language indigenous to Guatemala.</p>

<p>"She was so traumatized that she wasn't talking," Brane said. "She was just curled up in a little ball."</p>

<p>Brane said she also saw officials at the facility scold a group of 5-year-olds for playing around in their cage, telling them to settle down. There are no toys or books.</p>

<p>But one boy nearby wasn't playing with the rest. According to Brane, he was quiet, clutching a piece of paper that was a photocopy of his mother's ID card.</p>

<p>"The government is literally taking kids away from their parents and leaving them in inappropriate conditions," Brane said. "If a parent left a child in a cage with no supervision with other 5-year-olds, they'd be held accountable."</p>

<p>Dr. Colleen Kraft, the head of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that she visited a small shelter in Texas recently, which she declined to identity. A toddler inside the 60-bed facility caught her eye — she was crying uncontrollably and pounding her little fists on mat.</p>

<p>Staff members tried to console the child, who looked to be about 2 years old, Kraft said. She had been taken from her mother the night before and brought to the shelter.</p>

<p>The staff gave her books and toys — but they weren't allowed to pick her up, to hold her or hug her to try to calm her. As a rule, staff aren't allowed to touch the children there, she said.</p>

<p>"The stress is overwhelming," she said. "The focus needs to be on the welfare of these children, absent of politics."</p>

<h2 id="updatedrepthompsonreturnsshermandonationwillendorsebaria">UPDATED: Rep. Thompson Returns Sherman Donation; Will Endorse Baria</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-18</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/18/sherman-donated-wicker-thompson-sessions-baria-all/ </p>

<p>David Baria (left) and Howard Sherman (right) have both donated to federal election campaigns. Baria has donated to strictly Democratic campaigns, while Sherman has donated to Republicans and recently, Democrats. Photo by Delreco Harris</p>

<p>JACKSON — Howard Sherman, the slight frontrunner coming out of a crowded Democratic primary election, has a short but unique history of donations in federal elections—from a 2003 donation to then-U.S. Sen Jeff Sessions, a conservative Republican, to a 2018 donation to U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the only Mississippi Democrat elected to federal office.</p>

<p>In May 2018, records show that Sherman donated $481 to U.S. Rep. Thompson, the state's only black and Democratic congressman who is running unopposed. But after an earlier version of this story reported Sherman's contribution, Congressman Thompson called the Jackson Free Press to say he returned the contribution from Howard Sherman last week. He said the donation came in electronically, but if it had been a physical check, he would not have deposited it.</p>

<p>“I’m not supporting him,” Thompson told the Jackson Free Press. When asked to elaborate on why he did not want to take Sherman's contribution, Thompson said it would be misleading.</p>

<p>“Well, it would have been, I think, disingenuous on my part to take a contribution from someone who’s running for office that I’m not supporting because it could be construed that I am,” Thompson said.</p>

<p>Thompson told the Jackson Free Press that he will probably make a public announcement before the week’s end about supporting Baria in the run-off election on June 26.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press is reaching out to the Sherman campaign for comment.</p>

<p>Sherman's Republican Donations</p>

<p>In 2003, Sherman gave $500 to then-U.S. Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is now President Donald Trump's attorney general and presiding over the new zero-tolerance immigration policy on the southern border, including family separation.</p>

<p>Sherman recently explained that donation to the Jackson Free Press. After Sept. 11, 2001, Sherman said a friend and Nobel Prize winner called him up about a possible idea to combat biochemical attacks. He needed funds for his research, and that led Sherman to Washington, D.C., where U.S. Sen. Sessions knew Anthony Fauci, the then-director of the National Institutes of Health. The goal was to get support from NIH for the research so that the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency would fund it, Sherman said.</p>

<p>"We fly to Washington. We go to a cocktail party, (pay) $500, and meet Senator Sessions. He's just the senator of Alabama. I don't know I'm running for the Senate 15 years later," Sherman told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"I'm there trying to help a Nobel Prize winner get funded. He introduces us; we sit in a meeting with Tony Fauci. Tony Fauci takes us over to DARPA, and he gets funded. A Nobel Prize winner is working on something that can make us all safe. If I go back to that moment, do I not go to that cocktail party and get this guy funded to make us safe? Of course not."</p>

<p>Sherman also gave $5,000 to Sen. Roger Wicker last year, whom he could now challenge in November. His wife, the actress Sela Ward and a Mississippi native, also gave $5,000 to Wicker last year. Sherman's campaign website explains that he donated to Wicker as a way to prevent Sen. Chris McDaniel from winning, citing "the fear held by Democrats was, 'What if Chris McDaniel beats Roger Wicker?" He also made a $2,000 contribution to Trent Lott in 2006 because of the former senator's support of Sherman and Ward's Hope Village for Children.</p>

<p>Baria's Federal Donation History </p>

<p>State Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, who is in the run-off election against Sherman, has a long history of donating to Democratic federal elections, with consistent donations to the American Association for Justice PAC and the Trial Lawyers of America PAC.</p>

<p>Most recently, in 2016, Baria gave $500 to Mark Gladney who challenged Rep. Steven Palazzo to represent the Mississippi Coast in Congress. In 2017, Baria donated $3,000 to the Mississippi Democratic Party, FEC filings show.</p>

<p>"I put my money where my interests lie and where I think that folks are trying to improve the situation for folks who don't have a voice otherwise," Baria told the Jackson Free Press in a recent interview when asked about his donations.</p>

<p>"That's been what's guided my professional life, that's been what's guided my political life, and I think you'll find I've been pretty consistent in that regard."</p>

<p>Who's Giving to Them</p>

<p>Now that Baria and Sherman are no longer on the sidelines, their own campaign finances are in the spotlight. Sherman has raised more than $840,000 in campaign funds, but $650,000 of that total are loans he made to his own campaign. Sherman has spent $786,000, current FEC filings show.</p>

<p>Baria has raised about $250,000 without loaning his campaign any money. He had more than $150,000 on-hand to spend in mid-May, FEC filings show. Sherman spent a lot of his funds and was down to $56,000 in cash-on-hand on June 6, FEC filings show. These numbers will likely change before the run-off election on June 26.</p>

<p>BROWNSVILLE, Texas (AP) — An audio recording that appears to capture the heartbreaking voices of small Spanish-speaking children crying out for their parents at a U.S. immigration facility took center stage in the growing uproar over the Trump administration's policy of separating immigrant children from their parents.</p>

<p>"Papa! Papa!" one child is heard weeping in the audio file that was first reported Monday by the nonprofit ProPublica and later provided to The Associated Press.</p>

<p>Human rights attorney Jennifer Harbury said she received the tape from a whistleblower and told ProPublica it was recorded in the last week. She did not provide details about where exactly it was recorded.</p>

<p>Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said she had not heard the audio but said children taken into custody by the government are being treated humanely. She said the government has high standards for detention centers and the children are well cared for, stressing that Congress needs to plug loopholes in the law so families can stay together.</p>

<p>The audio surfaced as politicians and advocates flocked to the U.S.-Mexico border to visit U.S. immigration detention centers and turn up the pressure on the Trump administration.</p>

<p>And the backlash over the policy widened. The Mormon church said it is "deeply troubled" by the separation of families at the border and urged national leaders to find compassionate solutions. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, reversed a decision to send a National Guard helicopter from his state to the Mexican border to assist in a deployment, citing the administration's "cruel and inhumane" policy.</p>

<p>At the border, an estimated 80 people pleaded guilty Monday to immigration charges, including some who asked the judge questions such as "What's going to happen to my daughter?" and "What will happen to my son?"</p>

<p>Attorneys at the hearings said the immigrants had brought two dozen boys and girls with them to the U.S., and the judge replied that he didn't know what would happen to their children.</p>

<p>Several groups of lawmakers toured a nearby facility in Brownsville, Texas, that houses hundreds of immigrant children.</p>

<p>Democratic Rep. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico said the location was a former hospital converted into living quarters for children, with rooms divided by age group. There was even a small room for infants, complete with two high chairs, where two baby boys wore matching rugby style shirts with orange and white stripes.</p>

<p>Another group of lawmakers on Sunday visited an old warehouse in McAllen, Texas, where hundreds of children are being held in cages created by metal fencing. One cage held 20 youngsters.</p>

<p>More than 1,100 people were inside the large, dark facility, which is divided into separate wings for unaccompanied children, adults on their own, and mothers and fathers with children.</p>

<p>In Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for people trying to enter the U.S., Border Patrol officials say they must crack down on migrants and separate adults from children as a deterrent to others trying to get into the U.S. illegally.</p>

<p>"When you exempt a group of people from the law ... that creates a draw," said Manuel Padilla, the Border Patrol's chief agent there.</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, speaking to reporters during a tour of San Diego immigration detention facilities with Rep. Juan Vargas and other House Democrats, said family separation is a "heartbreaking, barbarian issue that could be changed in a moment by the president of the United States rescinding his action."</p>

<p>"It so challenges the conscience of our country that it must be changed and must be changed immediately," she said during a news conference at a San Diego terminal that is connected to the airport in Tijuana, Mexico, by a bridge.</p>

<p>U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas announced late Monday that he was introducing emergency legislation intended to keep immigrant families together.</p>

<p>"All Americans are rightly horrified by the images we are seeing on the news, children in tears pulled away from their mothers and fathers," Cruz said. "This must stop."</p>

<p>President Donald Trump emphatically defended his administration's policy Monday, again falsely blaming Democrats.</p>

<p>"The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility," he declared. "Not on my watch."</p>

<p>Mississippi Coding Academies, a joint project between Innovate Mississippi and the Mississippi Development Authority, recently named Belhaven resident Javier Peraza as an instructor for two new coding classes that will launch at the end of June.</p>

<p>Peraza, 35, was born in Los Angeles and moved to Dallas with his family in 1996, when he was 13 years old. He dropped out of high school in the 10th grade because he felt like "education wasn't for me" at the time, he said.</p>

<p>"After a while, I realized that was a terrible decision I had made in my life," Peraza said. "I ended up working a bunch of lousy jobs for years, until one day, I realized that I needed to get my life together and get my (General Education Diploma)."</p>

<p>Peraza earned his GED in 1999 and later attended community college at Richland College in Dallas. While there in 2008, he became interested in the world of politics.</p>

<p>He was taking a class on government when his professor offered an extra-credit assignment that involved taking a picture with a staff member of then-Sen. Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign during a rally.</p>

<p>"After hearing (Obama) speak, I decided that I would vote for him and help get him elected, so I started looking into how I could get involved," Peraza said.</p>

<p>He learned that the Obama campaign was offering a six-week internship for campaign organizers and decided to sign up. When campaign staffers informed him he would need to fly out to one of the swing states for the campaign, Peraza said he was initially reluctant because he was still in college and short on money. Ultimately, he chose to enter the program and traveled to Milwaukee. After the 2008 primary, the Obama campaign hired him as a field organizer.</p>

<p>After the 2008 election, Peraza returned to Dallas and worked as an organizer for health-care reform efforts in Texas. While there, he also finished his coursework at Richland College, earning his associate's degree in 2010. After his experiences in Milwaukee and Dallas, Peraza chose to continue his education at the University of San Francisco, where he majored in political science.</p>

<p>He took about a year a half off from college to work on Obama's 2012 presidential campaign. Then, he returned to USF, and during his senior year, he decided to become a teacher. He joined Teach for America, a nonprofit organization that helps find educators for low-income schools, and the organization assigned him to the Jackson Public Schools district.</p>

<p>Peraza moved to Mississippi from San Francisco in 2014 and worked at Forest Hill High School for one year before becoming a debate coach at Murrah High School. He stayed in that position until May 2018.</p>

<p>While at Murrah, one of his debate students expressed an interest in learning how to code, and prompted Peraza to develop a program that would teach kids that computer skill. Peraza contacted a friend, Devon Cantwell, and together, they created a start-up called Jackson Kids Code in 2017, so students like the one in his debate class could have an avenue to learn coding, Peraza said.</p>

<p>"Jackson Kids Code was initially going to act as a year-round coding course, but later, the focus shifted to summer coding camps," he said. "Later, I found out that Innovate Mississippi was setting up its Mississippi Coding Academies around the same time, and I met up with the organizers to see how we could cooperate. After Innovate started expanding its operations and taking on more students, they invited me to work as an instructor, and I accepted."</p>

<p>As an instructor at Mississippi Coding Academies, Peraza puts together lesson plans and evaluations for students. He is also working on a coding program for JPS students called the Mayor's Summer Jobs Coding Program, which is a partnership between Innovate, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba's office, Apple and other organizations. Four Coding Academies students will teach the JPS coders XCode (the programming language that Apple uses), and then, participants will go to businesses and work on building apps.</p>

<p>"I love working with the kids in these programs because they're hardworking and have a lot of guts, courage, determination and motivation to stick with a program for so long," Peraza said. "These students are dedicated to bettering their lives by learning to code."</p>

<p>In addition to his work with the academies, Peraza is in the process of obtaining a master's degree in criminology at Delta State University.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The charred remains of a replica Confederate flag and a Mississippi flag lay on the sidewalk outside the Mississippi Governor's Mansion Monday afternoon in protest of white supremacy.</p>

<p>Mississippi's chapter of the Poor People's Campaign burned the flags to conclude six weeks of activism against issues such as white supremacy and ecological devastation, National Organizer and Mississippi native Danyelle Holmes told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Forty-one states protested Monday, fighting for four ideals: overcoming poverty, the war economy, ecological devastation and a distorted moral narrative, Holmes said.</p>

<p>"We decided to burn it because it needs to be burned, it needs to come down," Holmes said. "We need a flag that represents all. We need a flag that does not represent hate, and so that's why we took to the state capitol to fight back against white supremacy."</p>

<p>The flag does not represent all the people of Mississippi, and in fact alienates poor people, especially poor black people, Hattiesburg resident AnnaBeth Row told the Jackson Free Press. In Mississippi, white supremacy tells poor white people that they may be poor but at least they are not black and poor, which makes it harder for people to come together, she added.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Sons of Confederate Veterans are fighting hard to keep the state flag to honor the Confederacy. Others are fighting back.</p>

<p>"Burning the Confederate flag means burning false lines of segregation," Row said. "There's this constant othering of the most marginalized people in our society, and this constant othering is what divides us."</p>

<p>Around 20 people gathered in protest, and chants of "hate has no home here" echoed through downtown Jackson. The protest came 48 hours after Gov. Phil Bryant, who attended a white supremacist Citizens Council high school in south Jackson, received the Gov. John J. Pettus Heritage Award from the Sons of Confederate Veterans.</p>

<p>Gov. John Jones Pettus was the 23rd governor of Mississippi who presided over Mississippi's secession on Jan. 9, 1861, to join the Confederacy. A Tennessee native, Pettus moved to Mississippi as a child and owned at least two dozen slaves in Rankin County as an adult. Pettus was one of the state's "fire-eater" pro-slavery politicians, who were the South's strongest proponents of secession in order to both maintain slavery in the South and guarantee that it was extended to new western territories. The fire-eaters also wanted to ensure that Mississippi's fugitive slaves would be returned to their owners after apprehension in other states. Pettus argued that Mississippi could only keep slavery a reality if it seceded and joined the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Pettus' brother, Edmund Winston Pettus—a fire-eater slave owner and later a U.S. senator in Alabama—served as a delegate at the Mississippi secession convention his brother convened. Active in the Ku Klux Klan after the Civil War, he is the namesake of the Edmund Winston Pettus Bridge in Selma, the site of major civil-rights protests in the 1960s.</p>

<p>In 1860, one in two families (49 percent) in Mississippi owned at least one slave. In 1857, Mississippi had passed an anti-manumission law to make freeing slaves illegal, as other southern states were doing up until the Civil War.</p>

<p>Pettus called Mississippi legislators together on Nov. 26, 1860, to vote on becoming one of the first six slave states to secede. Lawmakers stated their reason for secession in Mississippi's Declaration of Secession: "Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery - the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product, which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization."</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press revealed to the world in February 2016 that Gov. Bryant had declared April "Confederate Heritage Month," but with no mention of slavery.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press broke the news in February 2016 that Bryant was continuing the old tradition of declaring "Confederate Heritage Month" in April at the behest of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a proclamation that was not then routinely listed among others on the governor's website.</p>

<p>"I think it was a very brave action for this group to come out and burn this flag here in front of Governor Phil Bryant's mansion," Row said. "He is not just a proud member of Sons of Confederate Veterans; he also just won one of their awards. He is king white supremacy in Mississippi and this is making a direct statement to him as well as his followers, as well as letting him know, we see you."</p>

<p>Mississippi native Matt Salter said he attended the protest because he is planning to become a teacher in Mississippi and as an educator, he needs to be able to say he participated.</p>

<p>"If you're going to invest in the future of teaching kids, you have to have been involved in the process," Salter told the Jackson Free Press. "You have to have actually participated at least in some small way."</p>

<h2 id="lawmakersbarredfromchildmigrantfacilityinflorida">Lawmakers Barred from Child Migrant Facility in Florida</h2>

<p>HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson accused the Trump administration of a "cover-up" after officials denied him entry Tuesday to a detention center for migrant children in South Florida where he had hoped to survey living conditions.</p>

<p>Nelson and U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, both Florida Democrats, went to the contractor-run Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children following reports it was receiving detained migrant children who had arrived in the country illegally.</p>

<p>Wasserman Schultz said the facility was being used for an estimated 1,000 children, aged 13 to 17, who arrived here as unaccompanied minors as well as children separated from their families at the border. She said two other facilities in South Florida were being used for younger children.</p>

<p>"It is an affront as the senior senator of this state that an agency head would tell me that I do not have entrance into a federally funded facility where the lives and health of children are at stake," Nelson said.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump's immigration policies have come under intense scrutiny following reports of the forced separation of migrant children from their parents. Democrats and some Republicans are urging an end to the practice at the U.S.-Mexico border. Thousands of children split from their families at the U.S. southern border are being held in government-run facilities.</p>

<p>Wasserman Schultz said her staff had spoken Tuesday with the Florida-based company, Comprehensive Health Services, contracted to run the facility. She said her staff was told the lawmakers would be "welcomed warmly and allowed into the facility."</p>

<p>But Nelson said Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services Eric Hargan told him it would take two weeks for them to get access.</p>

<p>"I think what they're doing is a cover-up for the president," Nelson said.</p>

<p>Trump doesn't like the negative response he's received, even from fellow Republicans, Nelson said.</p>

<p>"Are they abusing these kids? Are they sleeping on the floor? Are they in cages, like we've seen in some videos?" Wasserman Schultz asked after being barred from the building.</p>

<p>The Florida facility is overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Department spokesman Kenneth Wolfe said in an email Monday that it had reopened as "a temporary unaccompanied alien children program facility." He did not provide additional details.</p>

<p>An Associated Press reporter was denied access to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar while he was at a Miami hospital Tuesday to meet with opioid patients. Spokesman Gavin Smith barred the AP reporter from asking Azar questions about the immigration facility because an interview with the secretary had not been pre-arranged.</p>

<p>Several dozen children could be seen Tuesday morning playing soccer outside the building behind a chain link fence, mostly talking and shouting to each other in Spanish. Some did cartwheel flips while running across the field.</p>

<p>Reporters were not allowed onto the property. Security officials would not let reporters near the facility or provide details on conditions inside.</p>

<p>Martin Levine, from the Miami suburb of West Kendall, came to the facility with a sign showing a Nazi guard pulling a child away from woman with a Jewish star, and saying "Nazis took children away. Trump inhumane."</p>

<p>Levine said he believed the policy to separate families was immoral.</p>

<p>"This is not a Democrat or Republican issue, because all of the former first ladies have found this policy despicable," Levine said.</p>

<p>Republican lawmakers from Miami-Dade County have condemned the policy of separating families crossing the U.S. border.</p>

<p>Florida's other senator, Republican Marco Rubio, said in a tweet Tuesday, "Let's change the law so we can hold families together while awaiting expedited hearings."</p>

<h2 id="hiringexoffendersmixedstatewideresults">Hiring Ex-offenders: Mixed Statewide Results</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/20/hiring-ex-offenders-mixed-statewide-results/ </p>

<p>JACKSON — Matthew Riley has been on the road a lot lately. As the state re-entry coordinator, Riley visited all 82 counties in Mississippi in the past nine months in search of employment opportunities for returning citizens leaving the state's corrections system.</p>

<p>He found mixed results, and the Mississippi Department of Corrections is hosting an all-day re-entry symposium on Thursday, June 21, to bring more stakeholders to the table to work on re-entry efforts. Riley said he is working on a survey for employers in the state to see if they have hired any ex-offenders.</p>

<p>"We had some good responses and ... after the symposium, we will come back and follow up with those employers we visited and ask them if anything has changed—asking if they hired anyone," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>MDOC staff members are in contact with some of the state's big employers like Nissan, Toyota and Ingalls Shipbuilding as well as other, smaller businesses. Riley is keeping a list of businesses statewide that will hire former inmates.</p>

<p>Riley was surprised that some mid-level employment positions are closed to ex-offenders due to rigorous requirements in state law. The casinos, which the Mississippi Gaming Commission governs, will not employ an ex-inmate, even in the restaurants or hotels. All casino employees have to go through extensive background checks, Riley said.</p>

<p>"I thought we had an opportunity to gain some ground for our men and women to go into hotels ... (but) that's out of the question. That really shocked me, particularly with the casino hotels and the restaurants," Riley said.</p>

<p>State law mandates that the executive director of the Gaming Commission "shall refuse to issue a work permit if the applicant has committed, attempted or conspired to commit a crime which is a felony in this state." MDOC currently has several vocational programs in its facilities, including welding and automotive programs. Riley said his goal is to identify mid-level career positions for ex-offenders, targeting companies that need the workforce.</p>

<p>"Mississippi offenders are an untapped workforce we are training in our facilities," Riley said.</p>

<p>Riley's big sell for companies unsure of hiring ex-inmates is the federal bonding program, a national incentive that provides protection for employers from loss of money or property for six months after they hire an ex-inmate. Riley is also educating employers about parole and probation. Mississippians on parole and probation are subject to drug testing and at times, other restrictions. He said those on parole or probation are already more accountable due to their required check-ins with an officer.</p>

<p>The re-entry symposium this week will bring subject-matter experts to the capital as well as policymakers, educators and health-care professionals, Riley said. MDOC needs community support to help with re-entry efforts, ultimately, due to lack of funding.</p>

<p>"We have no additional money for new programs," Commissioner Pelicia Hall said in a press release. "Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to make sure that we are teaching offenders what they need in the programs we have."</p>

<p>Indeed, MDOC cut off funding to county sheriff's departments after the legislative session this year, citing a budget deficit and the need to conserve funds. Lawmakers are aware of the budget shortfall in corrections in the state, but revenue collections are not likely to increase—many Democrats point to the 2016 tax cut that will pull even more funds from the state's coffers this fiscal year as the reason for this.</p>

<p>Even House Corrections Committee Chairman Bill Kinkade, R-Byhalia, admitted the challenges in corrections funding.</p>

<p>"The fact is we have funding issues in corrections. That's not a revelation to anybody," he said at the Capitol in April when sheriffs requested a hearing about their cut funds. "There have been some deficit-spending issues, and all of them haven't been addressed."</p>

<p>The state re-entry council has repeatedly handed off recommendations to lawmakers to ease re-entry for inmates, including provisions to not take away driver's licenses immediately upon arrest because inmates need identification to get a job upon release. The Legislature enacted a handful of criminal-justice reforms this year, including measures to stop judges and law-enforcement officials from stacking penalties on individuals as well as keeping judges from jailing men and women who cannot afford to pay their fines and fees.</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant vetoed another criminal-justice measure this year, however, that would have allowed inmates to keep their licenses (unless their offense was driving-related). Bryant said he vetoed the bill primarily because a provision would have required MDOC to determine whether an inmate is indigent before making him or her pay parole, probation or supervision fees. Mississippians on parole or probation must pay a monthly $55 fee; these fees account for an estimated $13.5 million in MDOC's budget. Citing budget concerns for the agency, Bryant vetoed the measure.</p>

<p>The re-entry symposium is Thursday, June 21, at Christ United Methodist Church in Jackson on Old Canton Road, at 9 a.m.</p>

<h2 id="editorsnoteamericawemuststopdehumanizingourchildren">EDITOR'S NOTE: America, We Must Stop De-humanizing Our Children</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p>Immigrants recently processed and released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection wait at the Catholic Charities RGV, Wednesday, June 20, in McAllen, Texas. Nearly 2,000 children have been separated from their families at the U.S. border over a six-week period during a crackdown on illegal entries, according to Department of Homeland Security figures obtained Friday by The Associated Press.

<p>Donna Ladd</p>

<p>As a child in the 1960s and 1970s, I was a bit of a freak of nature in my hometown of Philadelphia, Miss. You could call me sensitive or soft-hearted, or as the odd insult still goes, I had a bleeding heart. It broke me up (and still does) to see an animal hurt, and I felt human injustice deeply in my bones as early as elementary school.</p>

<p>Racial injustice was everywhere. Just about everyone around me of any age called black people by the n-word when I was a little kid, and the word "drunk" often preceded the word "Choctaw" for no apparent reason. The language of feigned superiority was like being blanketed with hate every day from all sorts of people calling other humans lazy, criminal animals by nature.</p>

<p>"They can't help it," some people, usually women, would add after one or another disparaging remark, often out of the blue and apropos of nothing.</p>

<p>By then, the slurs were whispered more often because unlike a decade before, white folks were more afraid to yell racially disparaging statements across parking lots or at people walking up to the courthouse to register to vote.</p>

<p>For reasons that are still unclear to me, I hated the ugly "prejudice," as we called it then, as early as third grade. Maybe I was born with neurons firing logic because it never made sense to me that a human being could be lesser than another based on the tone of their and their family's skin.</p>

<p>I started to speak up about it, and white adults would call me an n-lover (using the whole word). I guess that's when my skin began to toughen about speaking up about things that matter. I still don't insult easily, although many try, especially when I talk about racism. A white woman is just not supposed to do that, it seems. Sorry.</p>

<p>In a way I dodged a bullet, being only 3 when men I knew killed civil-rights workers Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner, and the media and FBI poured into town. The worst of white resistance was beaten down by the time I learned to properly write my name, and it was whimpering underground with at least a chance of dying out over time. Or at least that's what I hoped as I got older and learned more about my town, state and nation's brutal race history.</p>

<p>I have often wondered what my life would've been like had I come along 10, 20, 50 or 100 years sooner. Would I have attended those festive lynch-mob parties, or might I have put my life on the line alongside black civil-rights protesters? Would I have sat on the veranda in a hoop dress ignoring the brutality, or helped people get through the underground railroad? Would I have been one of those people who were complicit by doing nothing amid evil?</p>

<p>This week, many of us are encountering one after another person who is defending Donald Trump's horrendous policy of taking children from parents on the border and caging them. The defenders are swallowing Trump's ugly bait as so many adults around me did when I was a child, and as my ancestors must have as they owned slaves and their kids fought for the South.</p>

<p>Yes, they were taught many lies, just as people are now. Trump is using the same tactics of dehumanization of dark-skinned people that Mississippi's secession governor, John J. Pettus, did about slaves on the eve of the Civil War, and as Gov. Ross Barnett did about black citizens in the 1960s before we named a reservoir after him and threw up green signs on the interstate in his honor.</p>

<p>The language of racial and ethnic oppression is always about convincing willing participants that other groups of human beings are like animals, mongrels and predators who "infest" our nation, as Trump tweeted this week about migrants and asylum seekers trying to find safety and opportunity in the U.S. Since he announced for president by slurring Mexicans as rapists and murderers, while pushing lies about "black-on-white" crime, he has fed group bigotry to those apparently ready on some level to hear and embrace his "prejudice."</p>

<p>This week, Trump's apologists jabbed pitchforks at anyone daring to say that children do not deserve this treatment. They claim that breaking a law (which asylum seekers aren't) justifies arresting the parents and locking up the children. It's the families' fault that they put their kids at risk, you damn liberals, they yell at anyone who wants the babies out of the cages. You try to tell them that people like Barnett said breaking laws (like trying to vote or register at Ole Miss) justified what they did then, too. No, it's nothing like that, they declare.</p>

<p>Except that it is. So far, American history has cycled through dehumanization of whatever group the majority culture (usually white Protestants so far, let's be honest) has decided is inferior to good, hard-working people because they make bad decisions, or have a disorderly "culture," or their parents commit a misdemeanor to try to save their kids. People who dehumanize simply show no interest in the causes of the problems they blame entire groups for harboring in their ranks, much less the solutions.</p>

<p>They get a rush of superiority by judging "the other" without compassion or regard to the biblical teachings so many of them go on and on about.</p>

<p>Children have never been immune to this bigoted dehumanization; Hitler's goons killed Jewish babies with glee. Here in the U.S., slave children were stripped from their parents, with boys beaten by owners who often raped and impregnated young teen girls for their own pleasure and to produce new labor. (Call it long-range planning.) Native American children were stolen and put into boarding schools. Black boys, especially, have always felt threatening to many whites, studies show, accounting for why so many justify the killing of unarmed black children they deem "scary."</p>

<p>Horrendous crime policies were designed around the neo-conservative myth that young black and Hispanic boys made up a terrifying "super-predator" generation by nature, and those policies fueled mass incarceration and, ultimately, cycles of poverty, trauma and more violence.</p>

<p>Thus, it's not really a surprise that so many red-blood American white people are defending brown kids spending a few nights, or weeks, in cages—which are really just big chain-link rooms, they try to tell us. This dehumanization habit is embedded deep into our white DNA, and people like Trump purposefully trigger it with terrifying talk about MS-13 (which started in Los Angeles) and wild-eyed Mexicans coming for our women, just as the Ku Klux Klan and other racists ginned up fear of white women being raped to justify racism and violence.</p>

<p>That is exactly the way state bigotry has always worked—and it always will until we make it stop.</p>

<h2 id="runoffbluesinsidetheplayofftochallengerogerwicker">Run-Off Blues: Inside the Playoff to Challenge Roger Wicker</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p>David Baria (left) and Howard Sherman (right) Photo by Delreco Harris</p>

<p>Democratic U.S. Senate contenders David Baria and Howard Sherman share a common interest in basketball, at least for campaign metaphor purposes.</p>

<p>Speaking after a campaign lunch June 11 with state Democratic lawmakers at the King Edward Hotel in downtown Jackson, Baria compared the run-off election to the first game of the NBA finals, which turned the interaction between J.R. Smith and Lebron James into a meme overnight. The Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors were tied with four seconds left, and Smith caught an offensive rebound. Instead of going back up to shoot and possibly end the game, he dribbled out of traffic and prompted the Cavs to take an off-balanced shot, forcing the game into overtime. The Cavs went on to lose the game.</p>

<p>"Did you see the first game of the NBA finals? One of the Cavs took a play off and it cost him, right?" Baria said speaking to reporters after the lunch. "Mississippians, you cannot afford to take a play off or a day off, so June the 26th is an opportunity for you to get out and vote for the right person for this job. Don't take a play off, OK?"</p>

<p>Sherman uses NBA basketball coaching to explain why he is running for office.</p>

<p>"I talk about it like a sports analogy, like the Cleveland Cavaliers before they got Tyronn Lue. Or the Warriors before Steve Kerr became the coach. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson were there," Sherman told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Lue joined the Cavs as head coach in 2016; Kerr became head coach at Golden State in 2014. Since 2015, the two teams have traded off being NBA champions, until this year when Golden State clinched its third championship in four years.</p>

<p>"When you put (in) the right leaders, you can re-shuffle the parts," Sherman said.</p>

<p>The June 26 run-off election is a bit like the final playoff game in a tied series. Both candidates are vying to be the Democratic challenger to Sen. Roger Wicker, who holds a strong 11-year grip on his Senate seat and is now the ranking Mississippi senator since Sen. Thad Cochran's retirement.</p>

<p>In the June 5 primary election, Sherman brought in 713 more votes than Baria. Both candidates received 31 percent of the total votes cast, however, forcing the two to a run-off. This means that 37 percent of voters who did not choose either candidate initially can sway the election on June 26.</p>

<p>The Making of a Run-off</p>

<p>Turnout in the June 6 primary was higher than it was in 2014 by about 2,000 votes with 87,931 Mississippians casting a Democratic primary ballot. Baria and Sherman are working to swing voters who account for the nearly 32,000 ballots cast that were not for either candidate.</p>

<p>Delreco Harris State Rep. David Baria, also an attorney, says he is running for the U.S. Senate for his kids and the next generation of Mississippians.</p>

<p>Rep. Omeria Scott, D-Laurel, had filed her candidacy papers just before the deadline on March 1. Scott, a longtime lawmaker from Laurel, Miss., and former chairwoman of the Legislative Black Caucus in the Mississippi Legislature, came in a solid third place in the June 5 primary, receiving more then 20,000 votes. Scott, a colleague of Baria's in the House, endorsed Sherman just a few days later.</p>

<p>Scott, flanked Sherman and wife, Sela Ward, outside the city hall in Laurel called on Democrats to unite around the California native in the run-off election on June 8, Facebook live recordings show.</p>

<p>"Howard has met the criteria that has been articulated by the Democratic leadership in the state," Scott said, listing off some members by name who want a candidate who can raise money and who is electable.</p>

<p>"He (Sherman) came from the bottom to leading in the first leg of the primary," Scott said.</p>

<p>She endorsed Sherman on June 8, but when asked to elaborate on her decision for this story, she declined, deferring to the Sherman campaign's press release.</p>

<p>Many of the Democratic House members endorsed Baria early rather than Scott. His Twitter account was laden with photographs of lawmakers and their endorsements in the days leading up to the primary. On June 11, several Democratic state lawmakers met in downtown Jackson to strategize about getting their delegations to vote for Baria in the upcoming run-off. Baria leads the Democratic caucus in the Mississippi House of Representatives.</p>

<p>"I think it's fair enough to say that there are people who may not have been involved, even some members," Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, the vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said on June 11. "The first time we had another member running. This time we have one member running. This time I think there's going to be a more cohesive group of people working and doing it with a whole lot more energy."</p>

<p>The Legislative Black Caucus endorsed Baria before the end of that week.</p>

<p>Chairwoman Rep. Sonya Williams-Barnes, D-Gulfport, said she is working hard to ensure record-breaking turnout numbers for the run-off on June 26. Williams-Barnes' district is also on the Mississippi Coast, where Baria lives and is from originally. Williams-Barnes endorsed Baria personally as well.</p>

<p>"David is a man of his word. If he says he's going to do something, he does it, and if he finds out he can't, he's man enough to come back and say things will be different," she told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>After the Legislative Black Caucus endorsed Baria, the Associated Press called Scott, who said no one asked her about the group's endorsement.</p>

<p>The Businessman ...</p>

<p>The two candidates share some qualities: Both have had long, successful careers as an entrepreneur and a trial attorney, respectively. Both candidates are good at politicking, using their influence whether that be in the statehouse or Hollywood to gain ground in an election. The two candidates diverge, however, at their approach to the senator's job based on their experiences.</p>

<p>Sherman, 63, is a venture capitalist and entrepreneur who has made his career in the health-care technology business. He brings his business mentality into the room with him. When he met this reporter for an interview at Banner Hall, he walked right in to Lemuria and asked to use a private office for the interview, citing his relationship with the owners. Sherman worked with a Nobel Prize winner on technology to help prevent American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan from overheating in desert temperatures. Then he worked with a Michigan-based company on technology to keep bodies warm during surgeries, without pumping hot air over them, as is common practice.</p>

<p>Delreco Harris</p>

<p>"I get asked all the time what's the number-one trait of an entrepreneur, and it has to be great peripheral vision," he told the Jackson Free Press. "I was trying to help my friend get funding to help us all (stay) safe. The next thing you know I'm in the health-care business."</p>

<p>Born and raised in California, the son of an Eastern European immigrant mother was raised in a Democratic family, going with them to knock on doors for JFK.</p>

<p>Sherman voted as a Republican in California elections around 2000, because California Democrats got "anti-business," he said. He continued to vote as a Democrat in national elections during that time, however, and after he moved to Meridian, Miss., full-time, he disagreed with Mississippi Republicans. He drafted a 100-day plan he released this month and his anecdotes shared in his full interview (see jfp.ms/sherman) indicate that he understands the business side of politics. That has included giving campaign donations to candidates in order to seal funding for research and projects he was involved in.</p>

<p>The entrepreneur, who said he prefers jeans and a T-shirt to his campaign suit, does not believe being a Mississippi native is an important component of the campaign.</p>

<p>"The voters voted a week and a half ago, and they said we're going to pick the guy who wasn't born here because his ideas are better," he said. "(Voters said my) view of the future is better, and if they vote for him because he was born here then you're not going to wind up with these ideas."</p>

<p>Sherman has access to a network of Hollywood powerhouses, demonstrated by Robert de Niro and Alec Baldwin hosting a New York fundraiser for him in May. He also has access to his own personal funds. He has loaned his campaign $650,000 and hired the Doug Jones campaign team of Joe Trippi and Giles Perkins (Jones' campaign manager) to run his own. They are also running Democrat Mike Espy's campaign to fill Sen. Thad Cochran's vacated seat.</p>

<p>... vs. The Lawmaker</p>

<p>David Baria, 55, is banking on his experience as a lawmaker and his track record to secure the Democratic spot on the November ballot. When Baria met with this reporter for an interview in his glass-walled Baria-Jones law firm in Jackson, he was finishing up emails for what he calls "dialing for dollars" for the campaign.</p>

<p>His success as an attorney only translates to a certain point when it comes to raising campaign finances. Baria, who has a long history of donating to the Democratic Party and PACs in federal elections, lives on the Gulf Coast where he lost his home during Hurricane Katrina and soon his first son to an unexpected illness. As leader of the House Minority Caucus, he has had to wage losing battle after losing battle against a staunch Republican supermajority.</p>

<p>"I'm not telling anybody that we have been successful with our requests of the speaker (Philip Gunn) because we haven't, but we get heard. We do have input from time to time, and what I have learned in my time as leader is what (former U.S. Sen.) Trent Lott said is right. It's like herding cats because you have 47 individually strong personalities. You have to have a strong personality and an ego to get elected," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>David Baria for Senate Campaign</p>

<p>Winning several narrow elections in both the Mississippi Senate and House with Republican finances and endorsements against him, Baria is no stranger to being the underdog. His approach to the job is informed by his experience leading the minority caucus, his full interview with the Jackson Free Press (jfp.ms/baria) shows.</p>

<p>"My style of leadership is not to say, 'Here's what I think we ought to do, what do you think?' I say, 'Here's the problem, let's discuss,' and I take what folks say to me and try to synthesize it and then I try to make the best decision going forward," Baria told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>As the career lawmaker in the run-off election, he is reliant on his political experience and knowledge of policy matters from the Capitol. He has raised about $250,000 in donations and is working with Chism Strategies for his campaign. His law partner, Brandon Jones, is his campaign manager.</p>

<p>About the Tax Cut</p>

<p>Sherman and Baria agree that the recent GOP tax cut in Congress benefitted corporations and the wealthy the most—and that it did little to stimulate the U.S. economy. The two candidates have differing views on what could be done next, though. Sherman, who studied economics at Claremont McKenna College, says all fiscal policy is designed to achieve an objective. The only one that the GOP tax cut achieved, he said, was to benefit corporations.</p>

<p>"So if they had said, 'What do we need? Where do we want them to direct that money?' Because a lot of (corporations) just bought their stock back. A lot of them bonused out CEOs, and they bought yachts from Italy—well that didn't help the economy at all," Sherman said.</p>

<p>He said that if lawmakers had specifically targeted places that companies had to locate businesses—like the Delta—then they could have given them the tax cut.</p>

<p>"Had they said ... 'Pick a plighted part of the state, if you put a plant there in the Delta where unemployment is high, we will give you a tax cut.' But if you just are simply going to rebuy your stock back, it didn't do anything for the economy. I'm not saying I'm anti the tax cut; I'm anti an unfocused tax cut," Sherman said.</p>

<p>Baria sees the GOP tax cut as "nothing more than a payback for Republican donors who donated to the president." He noted that the tax cuts for the middle class are temporary, while the corporate tax cuts are permanent.</p>

<p>"I think if you want to do real tax reform that will stimulate our economy, then you give a big tax cut to middle-class America," he said. "Those folks will take that money and improve their lives by buying a new refrigerator, buying a new car, buying a new house, and that stimulates the economy," he said in his interview.</p>

<p>Baria said that rolling back the tax cuts for the wealthy would free up funds to use on transportation or education.</p>

<p>Immigration in Focus</p>

<p>As the Trump administration continues to separate children from their parents at the southern border, immigration is increasingly becoming an issue that Congress might act on in the future. Both Democratic Senate candidates believe that Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, immigrants deserve a path to citizenship or an extension of their status.</p>

<p>Sherman said immigration should be a focus point.</p>

<p>"If we have a shortage of nurses, then let's say, 'Hey, guess what? We'll bring in 10,000 nurses.' But if we have an over-abundance of construction workers and there are already people having a hard time finding (a job), then maybe we don't bring in a ton of construction workers," he told the Jackson Free Press. "I want to bring in—I don't know what the right number is—if it's 100,000 or whatever, but maybe we can do it in a way where we don't create a problem by trying to solve a problem."</p>

<p>At one point, Democrats in Congress were considering a compromise that allowed a path to citizenship for DACA recipients in exchange for Trump's border wall. Sherman noted the budget deficit when speaking about the wall.</p>

<p>"And the border wall, you know, we're in such a deficit to begin with. I haven't seen the data that shows me that that's going to really keep us safe," Sherman said. "We do need to be kept safe; all it takes is one person getting through, and we're in jeopardy."</p>

<p>Baria said the concept of the border wall is ridiculous, however.</p>

<p>"What we need is an effective means of securing our border with a combination of wall, fence, live security, cameras—a combination of those things, which I think pretty much already exists," he said. "Could it be improved? Yes. But the Great Wall of China along our southern border is a ridiculous expenditure of money, and it is nothing more than a political ploy."</p>

<p>Baria says the U.S. needs to revamp the entire immigration system and expressed concerns about the cost-effectiveness of locking people up or deporting those who are not criminals.</p>

<p>"... I don't think that it is cost-effective to deport every single person who is here without proper documentation," he said. "If someone is here without proper documentation and we pick them up because they have committed a crime, I'm for deporting them. ... There should be probably some level of crime that we define above which they get deported, below which they do not, (like) speeding."</p>

<p>Doug Jones Effect?</p>

<p>What will matter more in the June 26 run-off could come down to money and people-power—or both. Pam Shaw, political director of the Baria campaign, emphasizes their ground game with Mississippians.</p>

<p>"One of the things we're confident of is that people trump dollars. We will have the people; we will not have the dollars," Shaw said in Jackson on June 11. "But this election cannot be won by dollars alone."</p>

<p>Sherman hired the Doug Jones team to run his campaign, which helped Alabama elect a Democrat to the Senate in a solidly red state. His victory is seen as a part of the wave of candidates and seats "flipping" around the country in the wake of President Donald Trump's election. So far, Sherman has paid Trippi's team more than $490,000 for media and political consulting services, FEC filings show.</p>

<p>Howard Sherman for Senate Campaign</p>

<p>In an interview with Ezra Klein of Vox after the Jones victory, Trippi talked about the campaign's strategies.</p>

<p>"Trump's creating energy among the Democratic base that wants to come out and wants to make the change and wants to do something to fight back against what's happening. At the same time, he's creating enough chaos and divisiveness and hostility that Republicans who would never ordinarily vote for a Democrat say, 'OK, well, I've got all the chaos and hostility I can handle right now. I'll vote for somebody who wants to try to find common ground and get things done for me, even if they're a Democrat,'" Trippi told Klein.</p>

<p>Giles Perkins, who ran Jones' campaign, is also running Sherman's. Perkins was not made available to the Jackson Free Press for an interview by press time.</p>

<p>Rickey Cole, the former chairman of the Mississippi Democratic Party, says turnout is typically very low in non-presidential election years for federal primary elections. Cole said often times voters will not select a candidate they have not heard of or turn out to vote unless they are given a reason to do so.</p>

<p>While Cole is not privy to either Sherman or Baria campaigns, he said it appeared that the Sherman campaign did a good job of identifying likely voters in the primary election. Baria or Scott could have had the best shot at name recognition going into the primary, but Cole, who is supporting Baria, pointed out it would be limited at best.</p>

<p>"There are 122 House seats, and so, at best, David and Omeria had been on the ballot for 1/122 of the population in the state of Mississippi," he said. "... (That's) less than 1 percent state ID-recognition."</p>

<p>"I think a successful campaign has to overlay the geography with the virtual in order to be successful," Cole said.</p>

<p>Perhaps to that end, Baria was hosting a livestream Q&amp;A Facebook event as this story went to press.</p>

<p>The role of money and voter turnout could determine the outcome on June 26, and voters who voted in the Democratic primary or did not vote at all can go to the polls to cast a ballot next week.</p>

<p>More than 21,000 Mississippians are behind bars, and 34,000 more people are on probation or parole. Returning citizens go back to their communities looking for work, and true reform comes from people across the state offering second chances to the many Mississippians who need and deserve support after serving their time. Photo by Wikicommons/WhisperToMe</p>

<p>This week the Mississippi Department of Corrections will host a re-entry symposium in Jackson, a necessary step to re-engage stakeholders involved with the criminal justice system, from lawmakers and mental-health professionals to judges and experts.</p>

<p>Mississippi tried criminal-justice reform for a while, following the 2014 reforms the Legislature passed, but now as financial resources dwindle, MDOC is forced to reach out to community organizations in search for help. Conversations across industries are important, but how about some action?</p>

<p>More than 21,000 Mississippians are behind bars, and 34,000 more people are on probation or parole. Returning citizens go back to their communities looking for work, and true reform comes from people across the state offering second chances to the many Mississippians who need and deserve support after serving their time.</p>

<p>While Republican and Democratic lawmakers have found bipartisan progress in supporting reform measures, that support must trickle down to neighborhoods. Reforms work best in transparent and honest environments, which is where local government and law enforcement come into play.</p>

<p>In Jackson, the City has yet to implement a meaningful program to help returning citizens find work, despite promises to do so. The officer-identification task force has been underway to work on issues of transparency in the Jackson Police Department, but the members have promised to get a recommendation to the mayor by early August and have not yet begun writing policy.</p>

<p>Those who deal with every aspect of the law from mayors and police chiefs to district attorneys and lawmakers need to fix wait times in jails, find workable solutions to the roots of crime, job opportunities for returning citizens, and initiatives that demonstrate that all of the aforementioned entities don't just have to come in contact with people in handcuffs or behind bars.</p>

<p>David Baria, a longtime state lawmaker, is running for U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker's seat in Congress because he believes now is the time to change the state's trajectory for the next generations. Photo by Delreco Harris</p>

<p>David Baria knew he was fighting an uphill battle when he decided to run for U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker's long-held Senate seat. Baria's first challenge, however, is securing the Democratic spot on the November ballot. He faces entrepreneur Howard Sherman in a run-off election on June 26, after coming in second in the Democratic primary earlier this month.</p>

<p>Baria, a longtime state lawmaker, is not daunted by his odds. He readily admits that funding has been a struggle, and he knew that from the get-go. Wicker has more than $3.4 million in cash on-hand, even after launching a targeted campaign against state Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ellisville, before he switched to the special election. Baria, a trial attorney by trade who fought tort reform when it came to the state, has served at the Mississippi Capitol for 10 years. The Jackson Free Press sat down with him at the Baria-Jones law office in downtown Jackson last week for about 40 minutes.</p>

<p>What motivated you to get into this race? Is there a moment or a story that led you to make that decision?</p>

<p>I don't think there's a moment. I think there's a series of moments that led me to get into the race for the U.S. Senate—and a series of decisions that I think were very, very poor decisions made by our leadership here at the State Capitol and in Washington. If I had to point to the most important reason why I'm in this race, he's sitting right there at the end of the table (Editor's note: his son, Max, was sitting inside the conference room for a few minutes.), and I have two daughters, one of whom has just graduated from college, and the other one of whom is in college. So what I mean is, that not just for my kids but for everybody's children and our grandchildren, we've got to do something right now. The time has never been more appropriate to make some changes so that we can change the trajectory of our state. I want to be a part of that; I did when I first ran. You know, working in the Mississippi Legislature has been a very good experience, and at times it's a positive experience, and I have had successes there, but it can be very frustrating because I see our leadership make decisions that keep us in 50th place.</p>

<p>So, now that you're in a run-off, has your strategy changed at all for these three weeks? Or are you going to do more of what you've been doing?</p>

<p>Our strategy really hasn't changed. I think we had a very good strategy, which was to take somewhat limited resources, and when I say that, I'm very thankful that we've been able to raise and spend $300,000, which is really phenomenal for a Democrat in Mississippi during a two-month span, that's essentially what we're talking about. So I'm very proud of that, but when you're up against someone with what appears to be unlimited resources, then suddenly your resources don't seem to be as bountiful as they might otherwise. But what we're going to do and continue to do is to focus our resources on places that we believe the most Democratic votes are going to come from. We were fairly targeted; there were a lot of counties that we just weren't able to get to (before June 5). We had a different strategy for reaching those counties. One thing we are doing a little differently is I'm circling around to some of the counties that I didn't actually have a presence in—meaning I didn't go there, I didn't have an event there, I didn't visit there.</p>

<p>I made calls, and I called someone in every county before June 5, but now we're going to some places where we didn't really get to visit. What I found in looking at the data from the primary is that where I visited and where I had an on-the-ground presence, we did very well. And where I didn't, we did not do as well. So we're making a concerted effort to get the vote back out—our vote back out. And in addition to that, take some votes that may have voted for Rep. Scott, some votes that may have voted for the other gentleman, my opponent, and even create some new votes—folks that didn't go to the polls on the 5th—and we're doing that in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>I'm fundraising because I don't have the ability to write myself a huge check, so I'm spending some time ... dialing for dollars, which is the least fun part of this entire thing. I enjoy campaigning. I enjoy getting in the car with Matt (a campaign worker) and Pam (campaign political director), and going to an event and speaking before a bunch of people I've never met before. It's perverse, I know, but I enjoy that.</p>

<p>Part of what I've looked at is campaign donations and expenditures, but also where you've donated money in federal elections before. I was hoping you could comment on your contributions to the American Association for Justice PAC and other Democratic PACS.</p>

<p>I don't know what you mean; I put my money where my interests lie and where I think that folks are trying to improve the situation for folks who don't have a voice otherwise. That's ... what's guided my professional life, that's ... what's guided my political life, and I think you'll find I've been pretty consistent in that regard. Where I've spent my professional time outside of actually representing people, I just rotated off the board of United Policyholders, which I was very proud to be a part of for four, five, six years. That's a group that is an insurance, policy-holder, consumer advocate (group). I didn't get paid for that. I traveled at my own expense, and my time was at my own expense, but that's where my passion lies—in trying to help folks who might not otherwise have the ability to help themselves.</p>

<p>You were a strong advocate against tort reform, and I'm wondering how you think that's affected Mississippi, specifically when it comes to fundraising and "dialing for dollars."</p>

<p>It's impacted Mississippi in a number of different ways, but the biggest pitch that was made for tort reform was that you couldn't attract businesses to the state of Mississippi because we were a judicial hell hole, and that if we would just (enact) tort reform, then we would see a dramatic increase (in) job growth. If you will track Governor Barbour's statements from 2003 to today, you can see that job growth in Mississippi is flat. While we are always happy to promote companies that come to the state and open up new business and create new jobs, we had just as many companies fold their tent and go elsewhere. So the job growth never materialized, and the trade-off to me was too important to make, and that is folks that are catastrophically injured have a cap on the damages that they can recover.</p>

<p>I know firsthand, because I have represented people in this situation, when there's a cap on the damages, you never get to the cap, so it has decreased the settlement value of cases, and that is not a good thing for anybody but insurance companies. It doesn't help the person who is catastrophically injured because they have less money that they can recover in those cases.</p>

<p>Now, I would say that in terms of a perception standpoint that it's probably been a good thing because people may not think of us in the way that we were portrayed by the pro-tort-reformers. And they spent a lot of money portraying Mississippi as a terrible place to do business or practice medicine, so that was created, but at least with the passage of some of those tort reform measures, that part has gone away. But I don't think you've seen an influx of doctors since tort reform, and as I said before, you haven't seen an influx of businesses or jobs; and in fact, what you've seen since 2013 is a decrease in people locating in Mississippi, including young people your age and younger who are leaving the state in droves—so something is wrong here, and tort reform didn't fix it.</p>

<p>You've campaigned against the GOP tax reform bill that passed. Could you explain why you are against it, and what it does or does not do for individuals (in your opinion).</p>

<p>So let's talk about the federal GOP tax bill, Trump's tax bill if you will. I believe that that tax cut was nothing more than a payback for Republican donors who donated to the president. And we gave permanent, significant tax cuts to corporations that had, for years, offshored their businesses, offshored their profits and offshored their employees without asking anything from them in return.</p>

<p>The 1 percent got an enormous tax cut, which they did not need, and theirs is permanent. The middle class got a modest tax cut, which is temporary. I think that's upside down. I think if you want to do real tax reform that will stimulate our economy, then you give a big tax cut to middle class America. Those folks will take that money and improve their lives by buying a new refrigerator, buying a new car, buying a new house, and that stimulates the economy. Because if GE has to make more refrigerators, they've got to make more parts, they've got to hire more people. That leads to economic activity.</p>

<p>I just think the concept was wrong, and in addition to that, the way we paid for this tax cut was to increase the debt, which I thought every Republican in Washington said was a terrible thing to do when President Obama was in office. And the other thing they are already talking about doing is cutting Social Security and cutting Medicare. It's just wrong at every level. Now I won't argue with ... a middle-class person who says, "Well I'm getting an extra $500 in my check every month, is that a bad thing?" No, that's not a bad thing. You should be getting more. You should get more of the tax relief, and corporations should get less and the 1 percent should get none. And look, there are so many loopholes, if you really want to do tax relief, take the loopholes out. The effective rate that corporations were paying was already down around 16 or 18 percent with loopholes, so if you wanted to create a proper rate for them but eliminate loopholes, okay, I can see that. (Editor's note: While all corporations are subject to a 35-percent federal income tax rate, only half of those companies pay that full percentage, a recent study found.) But we didn't do any of that hard work. We just gave money to corporations—many of which were offshore—and to the very wealthy.</p>

<p>What would be your priorities for immigration reform? And specifically, there have been discussions about a compromise with a border wall for DACA. More recently, we have a (Jeff) Sessions decree saying you can't seek asylum as a domestic violence victim or if you're wanted by a gang. So what would you prioritize?</p>

<p>This is a complex issue, so I'm not going to give you some simple sound bite, and if you want my full response, get your hand ready. First of all, the concept of a border wall that runs the length of our border with Mexico is ridiculous. What we need is an effective means of securing our border with a combination of wall, fence, live security, cameras—a combination of those things, which I think pretty much already exists. Could it be improved? Yes. But the Great Wall of China along our southern border is a ridiculous expenditure of money, and it is nothing more than a political ploy.</p>

<p>So I don't agree with that, but I understand what you mentioned about Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi offering to agree to the wall in exchange for DACA. You know, DACA is important, those folks who are part of DACA, I think it stands for Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals, and these are kids who came to our country. You can't choose your parents. These kids came to our country, and we put certain restrictions or requirements on them. The kids who are here on DACA are meeting those requirements. They've upheld their end of the bargain. They are in school, or they have jobs, and they are paying taxes. This is what we should want from an immigration system, so DACA should be extended, and we're talking about a finite group of people that this applies to. These people will age through the system and become productive adults hopefully, that's the idea, but it's not a program that is continually open to new Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. It's a finite group of people. ...</p>

<p>I think that we need to revamp our entire immigration system. I think it is fraught with problems. I hear stories about people who try to do it the right way, and they stand in line metaphorically for years, and then you have folks who swim across the river, and they're here. That's not fair, and I understand that, but I don't think that it is cost-effective to deport every single person who is here without proper documentation. If someone is here without proper documentation, and we pick them up because they have committed a crime, I'm for deporting them. I have no problem with that whatsoever. There should be probably some level of crime that we define above which they get deported, or below which they do not (get deported, like) speeding, I don't know. But the other thing that is critically important to me, and I think it should be to all Americans, is that we don't separate families when we can help it. If someone commits a murder and they're here undocumented, then they (have) got to go. But we can't snatch children out of mama's arms at the border as a deterrent to folks trying to get into our country illegally. We've got to figure out a better system than that.</p>

<p>And the final thing is the piece that Jeff Sessions recently said about ending asylum for victims of domestic violence. I heard a very poignant story this morning on The Daily. They interviewed a woman from Burkina Faso, and she went through the story of her life and how her family essentially took a dowry, and then she belonged to her husband in her country and then he beat her all the time. He constantly humiliated her in public and made her life a living hell, and you know, if we can't be a place that accepts folks from other countries under such circumstances, then we're not the America I thought we were.</p>

<p>What is your stance on abortion rights?</p>

<p>Fair question. I didn't vote on the latest iteration (15-week abortion ban bill). I wasn't there. I was campaigning. There was another bill in 2014 (20-week abortion ban bill) I think that I didn't vote on; I'm not sure why. I don't know whether I wasn't there. I don't know whether I was in court, but I didn't vote on the bill, which I might look back and say there was a reason. ... There was an amendment to that bill offered by Rep. (Toby) Barker that I know I would have voted for if I was there because it provided exceptions to the 20-week bar in cases of rape, incest, health of the mother. I know I would have voted for that if I was there, so I was either off the floor or away from the Capitol that day.</p>

<p>But here's my position: I think abortion should remain safe and legal, so that we don't have a situation where only wealthy women are capable, because of their wealth, of getting an abortion by flying to some country where it's legal. I think that this should be a woman's right to make that decision, in consultation with her family and her physician. I have two daughters, whom I referenced earlier. If some crazed psycho killer raped one of them, then we should have the right as a family to make the decision whether we want to bring that baby to full-term or not. No one should take away that right.</p>

<p>Now, could there be some limitations on when you should terminate a pregnancy? Yes. I don't know what that should be. I'm not a doctor, nor will I ever get pregnant, but I think that we should let science dictate what that limit ought to be. And there absolutely ought to be exceptions to that limit for rape, incest, viability of the fetus, health of the mother. ... There ought to be exceptions if we're going to have a bright-line rule on a certain number of weeks.</p>

<p>What national criminal-justice reforms do you think Mississippi could benefit from the most? What, on a national level, can you do to help make that a reality?</p>

<p>You could end mandatory-minimum sentencing, particularly for drug crimes. This (currently) takes the discretion away from a judge and ends up with results that sometimes in retrospect appear to be unfair and just odd. And so I believe in electing good judges and letting judges have the discretion in any particular case, based on the facts of that case. We have far too many people who have been convicted of nonviolent drug offenses who are rotting in our prisons. And let's make no mistake about it, it is much more expensive to construct, to maintain and to operate a maximum-security prison than it is (to maintain) a community-based facility with less security.</p>

<p>I'm a criminal-justice major from (the University of) Southern Mississippi. In 1984, I had the privilege of going on the British studies program, and I studied at the University of London. And I studied the British criminal-justice system, and we toured prisons all over London and all over the countryside, and at the end of that program, I was required to write a paper. And I chose to write about community-based sentencing, and I've been in this place where I'm at now since 1984 because no one has convinced me that I'm wrong.</p>

<p>And that is, we ought to do more community-based sentencing for nonviolent drug offenders primarily, so that we don't remove them from their families and from their communities, but we punish them within those communities. We allow for more visits; we allow more freedom. So they can work on public beautification, picking up litter or whatever, but that they serve their sentences in a less restrictive environment because we shouldn't be in fear of them hurting us. They weren't convicted of a violent crime. I think that that is less expensive, more humane and a better way to re-integrate people back into society, and that's the goal of our system, is to rehabilitate people. So if that's really our goal, that's the best way to do it. Now, I'm not talking about murderers and rapists, those folks can go to Parchman. I'm talking about folks that have committed nonviolent, primarily drug crimes.</p>

<p>In the Legislature I watched you have a bargaining presence on the House side when it came to the education-funding-formula re-write, but if you were to go to the Senate, education policies that trickle down to the states are very different. So what, at a federal level, would you want to do for education? </p>

<p>I don't think that all the Title I money that is supposed to be coming to states is coming to states, and these take care of schools in underserved areas. And I don't think that all of the money that's coming to SPED (special education) that should be coming through SPED is coming to SPED, so that's a federal, congressional issue.</p>

<p>Here's what we could do in addition to those two things: You could roll back the corporate tax cuts and the cuts for the 1 percent, and you could send billions of dollars to the states that they could use for teacher-pay raises and to upgrade school infrastructure. You know, in our education budget, there's a lot of federal dollars already, but we could use more, and that's a way to get more money to states that are in need—and Mississippi's education system is in need.</p>

<p>If you go down to the coast, we have bright, shiny, relatively new schools because of Katrina, but if you go to Carroll County, it's raining on your head when you go into classrooms, in some of them. If you go to the bathroom there, two of the toilets, you can't use them. They try to keep it clean, but it's falling down around their ears, and that's a shame, and I hate to pick on Carroll County, but that's an example of a school I have visited and seen with my own eyes.</p>

<p>How has leading the Democratic caucus in the House changed your perspective about the political process or informed how you're running this campaign and what you would do as a senator?</p>

<p>I went to law school with the speaker, and we weren't best friends, but we were friends in law school. When I first got to the House of Representatives, he greeted me warmly and said you know, 'I know you're a smart guy, and I'm looking forward to working with you and I'm going to put you to work.' And I was elated, (I thought), "This is going to be great. We're going to be able to work across the aisle and get stuff done." That is not how things started off, and frankly, that's not how it's gone. But you know, while we started off kind of rocky because of some bills they tried to run through that we objected to, and we did a lot of bill reading and kind of slowed things down for a while to get an ear, since those days, we have been talking regularly.</p>

<p>I'm not telling anybody that we have been successful with our requests of the speaker, because we haven't, but we get heard. We do have input from time to time, and what I have learned in my time as leader is what Trent Lott said is right. It's like herding cats because you have 47 individually strong personalities. You have to have a strong personality and an ego to get elected. And you are responsible to your voters, so you have your own little area of responsibility, but yet, you're being asked to be a part of the group and cede some of that responsibility for the better of the group or the better of the policy issue at hand. It's a difficult management issue, but I think I've done a good job with it. Organizing and preparing for what is coming to us in a committee or on the floor in any particular day takes some time and energy. It takes a lot of help, so I have to be able to talk to folks who are on my team about how we're going to work through this problem.</p>

<p>And my style of leadership is not to say, "Here's what I think we ought to do. What do you think?" I say, "Here's the problem; let's discuss," and I take what folks say to me and try to synthesize it, and then I try to make the best decision going forward. And folks might not always agree with it, but they feel like they've been heard. Developing or honing those skills is going to be invaluable to me as I move forward. Working in an environment where you have to take into account what other people think and feel all the time is invaluable to me. I'm not coming from the perspective of a CEO. I'm not running for president, and I'm not running for governor. I'm running to be a member a 100-member body, and as a member of the super minority in the Mississippi Legislature, we can't get anything done without reaching across the aisle and getting Republican help. Whether that's passing something we want to pass or beating a bad bill, we have to have help.</p>

<p>So I've been there 11 years. I've built some relationships with some people that other people might look at and go, "Why are these two friends?" or "Why is he friends with her?" I will give you an example. I have filed a bill to create gender equality in terms of pay since 2013—five years now. The last two years, I have gotten help on that bill from Rep. Becky Currie, who is a staunch, probably Tea Party Republican, that is probably how she would describe herself. But we worked together on that and on other issues because we built relationships. You can't walk into a body like (the Legislature) in the super minority and say, "This is what I want to do, let's pass it this year." It will never happen. You have to work it over time, year after year, building relationships and trust, and those skills and that experience is going to serve me in Washington.</p>

<p>Mississippi is one of the poorest and unhealthiest states. Identify the top health-care reforms that you think could benefit the state the most. What decision do you think that the Senate and eventually Congress could make that could benefit Mississippians' health care and overall health?</p>

<p>(There are) two immediate things we could do. You could take the ACA, if you wanted to keep that legislation around, and there are some objections to it because it sort of forces people to buy insurance. And I frankly have a personal issue with forcing anybody to buy anything, whether it's car insurance or health insurance, but the ACA is here, and one of the things we could do is impose a requirement on states to expand Medicaid. Because we took the federal subsidy for a disproportionate share of uncompensated care away, so you're pulling the rug out from underneath them and not replacing it if you don't expand Medicaid.</p>

<p>So you could mandate that states do that, and I think that 37 states, maybe 38 after Virginia, have already done that. (Editor's Note: 34 states have expanded Medicaid, including Virginia, according to Families USA.) Mississippi could still do that voluntarily if we had leadership that wanted to do that. Look at Louisiana, after they elected John Bel Edwards, they expanded Medicaid, and that's helped Louisianans—so we could do it (too). But why not just say at the federal level, we made a mistake when we wrote this. The Supreme Court says we didn't make it mandatory; let's make it mandatory, and that would be a big step in the right direction.</p>

<p>The other thing we could look at is scrapping the ACA and enacting some sort of legislation that requires a basic minimum level of health care, maintenance health care for everybody. I don't care what you call it, but you know you could do that and then folks who had really good health insurance policies could keep that if they wanted to, but you would be providing basic health care for citizens who don't have it now.</p>

<p>And the group we are talking about, they are not the poorest of the poor because they are already on Medicaid. We are talking about the working poor. These are sometimes single moms with kids who work two jobs, but neither job provides health insurance and they can't afford to buy health insurance and put food in their kids' stomachs and put the roof over their heads. And those people, they get health care, but they get it sometimes when it's critical—so where do they go to get it? They go to the emergency room where health care costs five times as much, and folks who have insurance end up paying for it. That's a bad system.</p>

<p>We already get a lot of federal transportation funds, but do you have ideas to free up more federal dollars for states?</p>

<p>I definitely think we need more federal money for infrastructure, and I thought that's what President Trump was saying in 2016 when he ran on fixing our crumbling infrastructure. This is the right thing to do for two reasons. One, our infrastructure is falling apart. We have bridges falling down, we have bridges we have to close because they are impassable, we have roads that will tear out the bottom of our car. If we are going to continue to be a world leader, we need state-of-the-art infrastructure, and that's not just roads and bridges, but that's our power grid, our water and sewage systems, that's our Internet system—all of it.</p>

<p>The other reason we need to do it is because it creates jobs. This is investing in ourselves. This just makes sense on every level, but the proposal that came out of Washington, or the president I should say, was upside down. He proposed 20 percent coming out of Washington, and 80 percent coming from state and local governments. If our state and local governments had that much of the need met already, they'd be doing the work because they have to answer to their voters every day in their districts. So you've got to flip that percentage. You've got to keep TIGER (Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery) grants in place, and you have to have the money to do it.</p>

<p>Now this is something that I wouldn't mind increasing the debt a little bit to get done, because I think it would pay off in the long run through job creation and additional taxes being paid. But to me, the first step would be, again, to roll back the tax cut for the 1 percent and corporate America—leave the middle class in place. You would raise billions of dollars simply by doing those rollbacks, and then take some of that money, most of that money perhaps, and put it into a national infrastructure program where the feds pay 80 percent, and the state and local governments are paying the 20 percent.</p>

<p>What are you doing to engage young people to vote in this run-off?</p>

<p>Not enough. It's difficult to engage any age person in a run-off; you know the primaries in Mississippi in nonpresidential years just don't get much of a turnout. In 2014, the last time the Senate was on the ballot in a nonpresidential year, 83,000 Democrats turned out to vote. This year we had 87 or 88,000, so a bit of a tick up, and in a runoff you always have a drop. (Editor's note: In 2014, 85,866 Mississippians cast a Democratic ballot. In 2018, 87,931 Mississippians cast a Democratic ballot in the primary.) So could we do more to engage young voters? Absolutely.</p>

<p>One of the things I would like to see us do as a state is to give young people the opportunity to go to two-year colleges (with) tuition paid, as long as they keep a minimum GPA. We need to provide Internet in every community in this state, as well as better cell service. This is again part of our infrastructure. We just drove to Lawrence County today, on the way back from Lawrence County, I tried to call somebody three times and the call dropped three times. And this is not way out in the woods, this is just off the interstate, so we've got to take steps to improve that. ... Kids notice that more than old folks. ... Folks your age and younger—my kids' age—everything they do is through this phone in their hand, and they know when they don't have cell service. So in terms of engagement of younger voters, I definitely can and will do a better job of that as we move forward in November.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>Tuition is a big thing. Making Mississippi an attractive place to live by offering 21st-century jobs. I mean, we can do things that attract companies here, but we have to fix our own house first. I think we take the (state) flag, and we put the flag in a museum. Then we adopt a new state flag that everybody can be proud of, because if 40 percent of your population is offended by your state flag, then it's time for it to go. And I think a lot of young people see things like H.B. 1523. ... They see some of these carry-guns-in-churches kind of bills, the bills we see over there. They see the state flag and the reluctance to do anything about it. They see Confederate Memorial Day; they see these things as reasons why they shouldn't come to Mississippi. And hopefully, if they know that I'm the candidate who has opposed those things that are divisive in nature and give Mississippi a black eye, then they can get on board because I'm the kind of candidate who wants to change this 'us-versus-them' mentality that we've been suffering under for so long, and turn the page on this, and make Mississippi an open and inviting place for all ages.</p>

<p>Are you planning more town halls?</p>

<p>Between now and Tuesday the 26th, the answer is no. Going forward, yes. And I intend to ask Roger Wicker on June 27 if he will debate me, and what I intend to propose to him is at least four debates: one in each congressional district, live, televised debates. ... There will be two other folks on the ballot in November in this race. ... The people I think deserve to hear us talk side-by-side about the issues, and I'm not afraid of that.</p>

<p>I know I probably don't know (as much) about foreign policy at this moment as Roger Wicker, as he's been in Washington for 24 years. If he doesn't know more than me about foreign policy, that's his fault, but I will get up to speed. I think the people deserve to hear candidates debate, but no, I will not do another town hall between now and Tuesday the 26th. We just don't have the time and resources to do it right now. Our resources are better spent in other places.</p>

<p>Should you win the run-off, Wicker has a lot of campaign-finance resources. Do you have the funds?</p>

<p>Before I chose to get in this race, Wicker was sitting on four and a half million dollars, and I was sitting on zero. As I said earlier, I was pleasantly surprised by the outpouring of support I got from Mississippians. I was able to raise roughly $300,000 between March the 1st and June the 1st. In three months, I raised $100,000 a month. If I can raise that between now and November, I'd be in great shape. I don't know that we can do that, but we are certainly going to work as hard at it as we did in the primary. Here's the other thing: A lot of money was sidelined in this race because some folks don't want to give when there's a contested primary. They don't want to pick and choose between Democrats. Those folks will be off the sidelines after June 26. And I can tell you that we believe that we can attract the resources necessary to run a competitive campaign, including some folks who are outside the state who have already expressed interest in the possibility of electing two Democrats to represent Mississippi to Washington.</p>

<p>So I think some money will come. Am I saying I will match Roger Wicker dollar-for-dollar? No, but I don't need to because I have people on my side. Let me tell you a short vignette, this is a lived experience for me. When I ran against Scotty Cuevas in 2007, he was a 16-year incumbent, and he raised and spent probably twice as much as me, and I won. In 2011, I ran against a Republican who was endorsed by the governor and financially supported by the governor, she raised and spent three times as much as me, and I won by 16 points. Then in 2015, the governor, lieutenant governor and the Speaker of the House all endorsed and raised money for my opponent. He raised and spent four times as much as me, and I'm still sitting here.</p>

<p>So I don't mind long odds; it's what I do in my professional life every single day. That's what I've done in my political life. I know that's what I've gotten myself into, and I still believe in our possibility and our ability to win November 6. Look, we're outspent in this primary. Hell, he's loaned himself $650,000, and he's raised and spent with his loans probably close to a million, which is three times what I've raised and spent, and I have no idea what he's going to spend in the next week—but that difference will probably go up.</p>

<p>Howard Sherman won the most votes (about 31 percent) on June 5 in the Democratic primary for Sen. Roger Wicker's Senate seat. He even beat out longtime lawmaker Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis. Sherman, an entrepreneur and businessman, hired Alabama Sen. Doug Jones' campaign team and spent more than half a million dollars on his own campaign. Now Sherman faces Baria in a run-off election for the seat on June 26.</p>

<p>The California native moved to Meridian, Miss., permanently in 2016, with his wife and actress, Sela Ward, best known for her roles in TV shows like "CSI: New York" and "House" as well as films like "Dirty Dancing 2: Havana Nights." Ward, a Meridian native, and Sherman run Hope Village, a children's home in Meridian. Sherman and Ward have two kids but are now empty-nesters, and as Ward committed to filming "Westworld," Sherman met with Democratic leaders in Mississippi to figure out how he could get involved with politics in Mississippi. The Jackson Free Press sat down with Sherman in a back office of Lemuria in Jackson for a half hour interview on June 14.</p>

<p>Who or what convinced you to get into this race in the first place? ... What made you want to get into this Senate race to begin with?</p>

<p>Before I met my wife, Sela Ward, on a blind date 27 years ago, and just around that time, a little before that time, I was going to run for a congressional seat in Los Angeles where I lived. When I met Sela, I made a life choice. With her career being all over the place where she films and a career in Washington, (politics) wouldn't work, and it was very, very important for me to have a family and children and have some sense of balance, so I put that on hold—I thought (it) was (a) permanent hold, and then I spent a lifetime with Sela.</p>

<p>We've been married 26 plus years, and raising two fabulous kids and migrating from moving from Los Angeles to Mississippi. First, we spent four months a year (in Mississippi) because we wanted our children to understand authenticity, not superficiality. And now we've lived here two years full-time. I didn't plan two years ago when we moved here full-time to run for political office, and last December....</p>

<p>Let me segue for a second. Eighteen years ago, Sela and I came across these two young African American boys, Jimmy and Michael, in our (Meridian) community that were about to be separated. Their parents' rights had been terminated, and they didn't have any place to keep them together. There was no foster home for them, and we weren't in a position to take them because Sela was on a TV show 16 hours a day, and I was raising our kids while running my business, so we found a place for them. (We) swore to ourselves that that would be our project, giving to the community, and we started Hope Village for Children. We spent two years putting it together, and then 18 years ago we opened our doors, and since then, we're really proud of it.</p>

<p>We've taken care of over 3,000 kids—Mississippi's most challenged kids—and we're so proud of it. So I kiddingly say, you can mess with me, but don't mess with my kids—either my two kids or my Hope Village kids. And last December, I got a phone call from the executive director of Hope Village, and she said, "I need you in Jackson Thursday." And I was like, "What's up?" and she goes "I'll tell you in the car." So I jump in the car with her, and she explains to me that the Legislature in Jackson passed H.B. 2179, signed off by everybody, including the person I'm running against. He voted for it. And what the bill did was it moved the agency that funds kids, the kids at Hope Village and social workers, etcetera, and it moved that agency from being a DHS (Department of Human Services) agency to Child Protective Services.</p>

<p>By doing that, they lost all of their DHS funding, over $50 million. So suddenly, the crisis was that there was no money for more social workers. ... It was in a real crisis—and that's just horrible. I'm not going to stand here and accuse people who voted for that that they really wanted to do something horrible for the kids, but I will accuse them of just not understanding the implications of what they were doing. That in the private sector, a day doesn't go by that you're not thinking about revenue. If you have a business (like) Jackson Free Press, I'm sure they think about revenue all the time. And yet, a career legislator would think, "Oh let's move it, that sounds like a good idea. We'll move it to child protective services."</p>

<p>So I was so upset, because it would have been the end of Hope Village, so and then it triggers this waterfall effect. You know when you make a mistake, it's not just the immediate ramifications, there's the waterfall effect. (It) puts us in breach of the Olivia Y lawsuit, which is where Mississippi was sued for poor care of the kids, now the federal government could come in and take over—there's a cascade effect. So I went and met with the Democratic Party, and said, "What opportunities are there for me to get involved?" Because now that we're empty-nesters and our son is in the professional workforce and my daughter is going to be a junior in college... We talked about how there's only two races on the ballot: the congressional seat and the Senate seat, and we looked at my background, my message, my ability and what I could do with the state and the way that the district was gerrymandered, we decided the Senate would be better.</p>

<p>And I left there with the paper, took it home, filled it out. It's a very simple paper actually, it's like name, address, and are you a felon or something like that. So I filled it out, wrote the check, but didn't send it in because it's an enormous undertaking: not just the campaigning, but it is literally hijacking your life to go do something completely different. You know, Sela and I have worked hard for careers that are almost 40 years long and raised kids. We very much—I kiddingly say, but I'm not kidding, I probably haven't had a day off since third grade. I could probably justify taking a day off. I've created thousands of jobs and supported my wife in a career that's very demanding, so I thought about it, and I wasn't ready yet to do it.</p>

<p>And then February came, and the federal government (and) President Trump passed, with Roger Wicker's support, the "Family First Prevention Services Act" which took money from what was funding kids—the money that we had lost by virtue of Jackson that they've (since) scrambled to put (CPS) back under DHS—but they took that money and they put it in a good place, to help families keep kids before they lose them to foster care, but they didn't replace the money from someplace else. So in the long run, perhaps there will be less kids in the system, but not immediately, you're still getting kids everyday.</p>

<p>So (Congress) completely stripped our funding to very low levels, but worse, they layered conditions on children's homes in the state that not a single one in Mississippi that is a state-funded institution meet. So technically, as of today, Hope Village, Canopy, all the children's homes have to close, which leaves no place for these kids to go. (Editor's note: States do not have to submit new plans under the federal legislation until October, and the new plans will not go into effect until October 2019.) And it's not just where the kids go that don't have a home, we will get kids that they pull out of a home that need to just be stabilized. They've seen mom and dad go to jail, so we'll spend a month stabilizing them, letting them know... they are in a community of kids. There are tutors who work with them to get them on track.</p>

<p>Sen. Wicker supported President Trump with that bill, so all the executive directors flew to Washington—many of them from Hope Village and Canopy and several (others)—flew up to sit with him and say, "Sen. Wicker, this is bad policy, the conditions, because we otherwise have to close, and you've got to find the money somewhere." And the senator didn't show up for the meeting. They sat in his office and met with his staff, and then when he came, he said, "I'm sorry, y'all, I have another meeting," and they had to leave. So they never met with him. They met with some 20-something-year-old staffer. That's when I sent the paper in. It's just not OK; I mean this is just, when you have politicians that take big money from special interest groups, that's their real constituency.</p>

<p>That's what's wrong, and one of the first things I would love to do, and there's like 40 things at number one on my list, but one of them is campaign-finance reform. Because if there is a politician who is taking—if it requires big money to win and the people who give you the big money, then they become constituents of yours, and probably in line in front of Mr. and Mrs. Jones living in the suburbs. So when a bill comes up and Monsanto gave one of our senators money, does he vote for Monsanto or does he vote for the Delta so we don't have to use toxic things?</p>

<p>... We just need to bring, you know, creativity, and I'm a business guy. I published my 100-day plan on my website to just say, I'm not just going to tell you like my competitor in this race is, "I'm going to go fight for you, I'm going to go get us what we deserve." Well duh, anybody would do that.</p>

<p>It's thinking out of the box. This state is a remarkable, remarkable place. It's not a state with problems. It's just a very much under-performing state. I talk about it like a sports analogy—like the Cleveland Cavaliers before they got Tyrone Lew. Or the Warriors before Steve Curry became the coach. Steph Curry and Klay Thompson were there. When you put the right leaders, you can re-shuffle the parts, so when you look at my 100-day plan, it's not just, "Well, I'll go get as much money," because you know everybody is fighting for that money. There's a limited amount; there's no appropriations tree that we grow in the Delta that we can water... So anyway, that's the concept, so when the second red line was crossed with the "family prevention" act, (I filed to run).</p>

<p>Talk to me a bit about your business background. Your website mentions that you, your company contracted with the Department of Defense in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, and how that background would translate into your role as senator.</p>

<p>One of the things that my opponent loves to say about me is that I gave $500 to Jeff Sessions, so after 9/11, you're too young to remember this.</p>

<p>Oh, no. I'm not ...</p>

<p>But anthrax packages were showing up, laden with biochemical things, we were really afraid that the next shoe to drop after 9/11 would be a chemical attack, a biochemical attack. (Former President) George Bush announces this $6 billion Bioshield program, (saying), 'We will fund anything that can help us be safe from that.' So I was friends with a Nobel Prize winner, and he calls me up and says, "I was reading about this; I think I've got the answer. I think I can trick an immune response that we're all born with, the alpha gal-immune response, which causes us to reject foreign organs. We're all born with it, really robust. I can hijack it to go after whatever you want: anthrax, smallpox without inoculation." I said, 'Carey, that's huge,' and he said, "I need some money to do my research," so I called my lawyer and he said, "Here's a Washington lawyer who does these things." And he says, "You know what? Jeff Sessions knows Tony (Anthony) Fauci at NIH (National Institutes of Health). We've got to get to NIH, because if NIH recommends it, DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) will fund it."</p>

<p>So he takes me. We fly to Washington. We go to a cocktail party—$500 and meet Senator Sessions. He's just the senator of Alabama. I don't know I'm running for the Senate 15 years later. I'm there trying to help a Nobel Prize winner get funded. He introduces us; we sit in a meeting with Tony Fauci. Tony Fauci takes us over to DARPA, and he gets funded. A Nobel Prize winner is working on something that can make us all safe. If I go back to that moment, do I not go to that cocktail party and get this guy funded to make us safe? Of course not. There's not a person on the planet that would argue with that, so that leads me to DARPA.</p>

<p>I'm at the closing dinner with DARPA, and I turn to one of the PhDs, and I said, "What is the coolest technology you've ever worked on that you could tell me about?" He told me about this technology that noninvasively can control your body's temperature through the palm of your hand. I say, "Is it top-secret?" He said, "No, I mean, we're using it, and we're experimenting with it." I call the CEO up; it's a Michigan company. He and I become friends; next thing you know, I become deeply involved with the company.</p>

<p>And then we introduce a product that's used to keep our soldiers—we were in Iraq and Afghanistan—these wonderful, amazing soldiers were driving around in Humvees where it's 120 degrees inside, they have 50 pounds of gear on, there's no air conditioning, it's not a Chrysler. And when you get overheated, your body's ability to operate breaks down—that's why at one point, you cramp up. So we introduced the product that's used to this day by soldiers in training, and they use them in the Middle East.</p>

<p>So we took that company and said, "Well, if you can cool a body, you can warm the body." So now we've introduced the product that's used in the operating room because the current product that's used in the operating room blows hot air on top of your body—literally just warms, you're in a warm cocoon. But there's over 6,000 lawsuits against that company because in that air could be a pathogen, and it's all over your body. So we took that same technology and used it actually in Meridian, to you put your hand in this thing, and it's recirculating warm water. There's no air, so that technology will lower infections in operating rooms.</p>

<p>So it was just chance, and when you're an entrepreneur like me, I get asked all the time what's the number-one trait of an entrepreneur, and it has to be great peripheral vision. I was trying to help my friend get funding to help us all (stay) safe. The next thing you know, I'm in the health care business ... then I meet the Michigan company, we develop a product for our soldiers, and now I'm in the perioperative warming business, and now I'm introducing that as a senator which doesn't require legislation, it just requires leadership.</p>

<p>You were registered as a Republican voter in California at one time. When did that (party affiliation) shift happen for you? Has it been a gradual shift, and now you're running as a Democrat. ... I'm curious if this has been over time or a light-switch thing.</p>

<p>I am the son of an immigrant. My mother and her mother came to this country from Eastern Europe, and when you grow up in a family like that, it's a solidly Democratic family. My first early memories of politics was going door-to-door for JFK in 1960. When he was elected, my parents thought he was the second coming. He was going to bring us, unite us all together—we were going to go to the moon with him. And I still have my little JFK pin locked away in a safe deposit box, and I was a Democrat because Democrats were empathetic.</p>

<p>Democrats were not, at that time, anti-business, they were not anti-success. But they were success (focused), but humanistic. So you know, my mother comes to this country not speaking a word of English, but it was all about education. So I spend my life in education. I wind up getting my master's degree, so in my 40s, now I'm a career entrepreneur. And in California, a very different place than Mississippi, a very different place, a place where they elected "The Terminator" Arnold (Schwarzenegger), twice to be the governor.</p>

<p>Now do you think the Democrats in Mississippi would support Arnold to be their governor? Probably not. So the Democrats got very "anti-business," that's a general term, but businesses were leaving the state because they were over-regulating and taxes were going up. And Elon Musk ... is building his cars in California, but he puts his battery plant out of state. Look at my wife's business, it was all in Los Angeles, it was all in Hollywood, and now it's in Atlanta, it's in New Orleans, it's in Canada—my wife's last TV show was filmed in Albuquerque. Because they got hostile, they got purist, and you know, a Republican in California is not a Republican in Mississippi.</p>

<p>On social issues they (California Republicans) are much more moderate, so my feeling is that if you don't have strong businesses, you don't have jobs. And if you don't have jobs, it creates a spiral effect, that now you, not just economically, but you have households where the daddy is not working or the mama is not working, it creates a whole self-esteem thing and the kids see dad ... So that was when around 2000, I switched (political parties) in my mid-40s from being a Democrat to Republican because I just didn't like what was happening with California Democrats. On a national level, I continued to vote Democratic, but just locally—in the state—I voted (Republican).</p>

<p>And then when we moved to Mississippi, and here I just very much disagree with the Republicans. Republicans have a supermajority in Jackson, so they literally have the ball and the referees, and the Democrats are on the sidelines—and they still can't get us off the bottom. And they are busy arguing about the 15 percent of stuff without saying, "I will argue with me about the flag or about whatever, but let's get (to) fixing health care." So it was just really me leaving California.</p>

<p>Ironically, in the beginning, when my campaign team—when I hired the Doug Jones' campaign team—they said, "You realize they're going to paint you as a California liberal, too liberal for Mississippi." It's so ironic. So everyone knows California and Massachusetts are very liberal, so it was really driven by what they were doing to the business community. So it wasn't a tipping-point moment, it was just when I saw people, friends in my wife's business, losing houses and having to move out, that's when I changed parties, and now that I'm in Mississippi, there's not a doubt (about running as a Democrat).</p>

<p>What is your position on the GOP tax bill that they just passed? Are there changes you want to see in it, or does it need to go away completely?</p>

<p>Here's my problem with the tax bill. I was an econ major in college. Tax policy is a part of fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is what the federal government uses to guide the economy to make corrections. I read today, everybody is excited about the low unemployment numbers, which is great, but now there's inflationary pressure starting. There's a whole balance, and they tweak it, just you know, so now we might have got, I'm not saying we've got overgrowth, but now interest rates have been up for the second time, and it will go up two more times this year.</p>

<p>So that's what fiscal policy is a part of, so my problem ... fiscal policy is designed to achieve an objective. I don't know what the objective was (of the tax bill). The objective was to corporations, "We're going to give you a boat-load of cash." So if they had said, "What do we need? Where do we want them to direct that money?" Because a lot of them just bought their stock back. A lot of them bonused out CEOs, and they bought yachts from Italy—well, that didn't help the economy at all. Had they said—see , I'm not privy to the information to justify or not justify the tax cut, but had they said, "Oh my gosh, in these parts of your state, pick a plighted part of the state, if you put a plant there in the Delta where unemployment is high, we will give you a tax cut." But if you just are simply going to rebuy your stock back, it didn't do anything for the economy. I'm not saying I'm anti the tax cut; I'm anti an unfocused tax cut.</p>

<p>Talk to me about your policy priorities on immigration. Do you think that something should happen in terms of a DACA-border wall compromise like they were talking about? And then most recently with the new asylum decree from Jeff Sessions saying that domestic violence and gang affiliation (fleeing or turning in gang members) don't count for asylum anymore.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we were all immigrants at some point going back far enough in our family tree. Directly, my mother was an immigrant, so I think it's a big part of what makes this country, not just this heritage, but literally on a current, it brings in fresh ideas, fresh blood, etcetera. However, there's nothing wrong with being focused on it again. .... Some of immigration definitely needs to be focused on. If we have a shortage of nurses, then let's say, "Hey, guess what? We'll bring in 10,000 nurses." But if we have an over-abundance of construction workers, and there are already people having a hard time finding (a job), then maybe we don't bring in a ton of construction workers. I want to bring in—I don't know what the right number is—if it's 100,000 or whatever, but maybe we can do it in a way where we don't create a problem by trying to solve a problem.</p>

<p>The DACA thing is really tricky because these people have been here for a long time; they are integrated. I do believe that people who come from elsewhere really got to play by the rules. We're not opening a door to have people come in here and wind up in jail, that's not the point of the thing. So but you know, people who are a part of the DACA generation that are law-abiding, I think we give them a path. And the border wall, you know, we're in such a deficit to begin with. I haven't seen the data that shows me that that's going to really keep us safe. We do need to be kept safe; all it takes is one person getting through, and we're in jeopardy.</p>

<p>What is your stance on abortion rights?</p>

<p>OK, abortion rights, obviously ... falls into that 15 percent that you know, obviously, that divides us. You know there are certain issues in life that are individual, moral compass issues that I think you know... I'm a religious person; I'm a spiritual person that I think you're accountable to yourself and to whatever you think the Lord is ... as your senator ... the only place you're going to impact that is voting on a Supreme Court justice, and I'd never be a single-issue person. I would never rule somebody out because of that, and I would never vote for somebody exclusively for that. So at the moment, it's not really a major part of this campaign, so that's all I have to say about that.</p>

<p>What national reforms, if any, do you support for criminal justice?</p>

<p>We need to definitely migrate from looking at prisons as warehouses to looking at prisons for rehabilitation, if we can. I'm actually involved in a company that is moving their production to a federal prison in Beaumont, Texas, because they are opening a factory within the prison. So anything we can do, especially with nonviolent offenders, if we can do things like that: employ them, give them a job so when they come out, they're not just... they've been in the library and then they have to go find a job.</p>

<p>So rehabilitation has got to be a huge thing, and we also have to look at alternative ways for nonviolent offenders (to re-enter society). It might be a game of chance to just, you know, with an electronic bracelet, and say, "You got a job; you got a home. We know where the club is. We know where your buddies who take you to no good is. We are going to give you this chance." People make mistakes. There's a mayor in Mississippi who's a good friend of mine, owns multiple businesses, is a preacher and oh by the way, did time for six years. So people can be rehabilitated.</p>

<p>Why should voters try you, a non-native Mississippian, versus your opponent who has lived here his whole life?</p>

<p>That is the most baffling thing that my opponent is running on, because if you have a choice between a person who's proven to know how to create jobs and offer creative solutions. ... You know, he and I were at the county supervisors' meeting down on the coast ... and he spoke and I spoke. And (my talk) was filled with, "Here's how we get infrastructure dollars beyond federal dollars. Here's how we can cut costs." We can group municipalities together to go for joint bids. There's a lot of things. We can look for corporate sponsors for bridges. You want good will in the community? We'll put a billboard up that says this bridge repaired by Goodyear or something. He got up there and said, "I'm the only one in this race who was born here." I don't know how him being born here, versus me not being born here, fixes that bridge or gets us health care. The voters voted a week and a half ago, and they said, "We're going to pick the guy who wasn't born here because his ideas are better, his view of the future is better." And if they vote for him because he was born here, then you're not going to wind up with these ideas. I don't know what to tell you.</p>

<p>When Blake Feldman was in college, he planned on going to medical school. The Newton, Miss., native received a bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Southern Mississippi in 2011. However, after graduation he decided against the medical field and ended up going to University of Georgia School of Law instead.</p>

<p>At first, he thought he would focus on public-health law, but in a class during the first year, he began to see injustices in the country's criminal-justice system, particularly aspects of it in the Deep South.</p>

<p>He says he got lucky during his first semester when he got one of the best criminal-law professors at Georgia Law, Erica Hashimoto. In that class, she covered topics such as racial bias in sentencing and prosecutorial discretion (authority of an agency or officer to decide charges in a case and how to pursue it).</p>

<p>"Georgia Law isn't a super progressive law school," he says. "I was really shocked at really, really brilliant peers in my class who were unmoved by some things that I thought were just egregious."</p>

<p>That motivated him to change his elective to criminal procedure.</p>

<p>"Criminal procedure is really where you see the systemic breakdown of fair courts, especially for people of color and for low-income individuals," he says. "You just start out thinking like, 'Oh, the Fourth Amendment, this is such a great thing, and that it's just over the course of three months, you just see it chipped and chipped and chipped away."</p>

<p>He received his law degree in 2015 and decided to focus on advocacy and community organizing, and policy council and analysis. In July 2015, he wrapped up his assignments with the public defender's office in Athens, Ga., and that August, he became the advocacy coordinator for criminal justice reform at the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi. In that position, he often spent time at the Mississippi Capitol during the legislative sessions, and when he was not there, he worked with ACLU on policy advocacy at county and state levels, and assisted with developing litigation for class-action lawsuits.</p>

<p>He left the organization earlier this year and worked with Southern Poverty Law Center on a case and is doing policy advocacy consulting for a criminal-justice-reform organization Justice Collaborative LLC in Louisiana. For the next year, he says he wants to keep doing part-time advocacy and consulting.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Justice Department's watchdog faults former FBI Director James Comey for breaking with established protocol in his handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation, but it says his decisions before the 2016 elections were not driven by political bias, according to a person familiar with the findings.</p>

<p>The report from the inspector general also criticizes Comey for not keeping his superiors at the Justice Department, including former Attorney General Loretta Lynch, properly informed about his handling of the investigation, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the report is not yet public.</p>

<p>The report's findings are to be made public later Thursday. It represents the culmination of an 18-month review into one of the most consequential FBI investigations in recent history.</p>

<p>The report has long been expected to criticize the FBI's handling of the Clinton email probe, stepping into a political minefield while examining how a nonpartisan law enforcement agency came to be entangled in the 2016 presidential race.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump is looking to the report to provide a fresh line of attack against two former top FBI officials, Comey and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, as he claims that a politically tainted bureau tried to undermine his campaign and, through the later Russia investigation, his presidency. Trump is certain to try to use the report to validate his firing of Comey last year.</p>

<p>But the report could do more to back Democratic claims that the FBI actually contributed to Trump's victory, most notably by reopening in the final days of the race its investigation into whether Clinton mishandled classified information. That development unfolded as Trump's own campaign — unbeknownst at the time to the American public — also came under FBI investigation for possible coordination with Russia.</p>

<p>Inspector General Michael Horowitz, a former federal prosecutor appointed by President Barack Obama, prepared the report. Supporters from both parties regard him as apolitical. His most significant report before this was the 2012 study of the botched Obama-era gun operation known as Fast and Furious.</p>

<p>The Clinton report will examine key actions by FBI leaders, including Comey's decision to publicly announce in July 2016 his recommendation against criminal charges for Clinton, and his disclosure to Congress days before the election that the investigation was being revived because of newly discovered emails.</p>

<p>An earlier inspector general report criticized McCabe and led to his firing on allegations that he misled internal investigators about his role in a news media disclosure. He denies those charges.</p>

<p>Thursday's IG findings were first reported by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>JACKSON — A group of Jackson and Hinds County leaders has begun meeting bi-monthly to work on improvements to the adult and juvenile justice systems in the city and county, after Hinds County entered into a 2016 settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>

<p>DOJ investigated the Raymond and Jackson detention centers in 2014, and the county's juvenile justice center, Henley-Young, was the subject of a federal lawsuit back in 2011. DOJ issued a findings letter in 2015 with concerns about inmate safety at the Raymond and Jackson facilities, alleging that the county was in violation of detainees' constitutional rights.</p>

<p>Hinds County Board of Supervisors attorney Pieter Teeuwissen said all the stakeholders involved in the criminal justice system need to figure out how to move people through the system faster. Right now, individuals can sit in jail for as long as four years, he said.</p>

<p>"We need to figure out how to prioritize these individuals in these facilities," Teeuwissen told the Jackson Free Press. "... If they are not guilty, we shouldn't have them detained in less than appropriate conditions. If they are guilty, they are supposed to be processed through and put in the state correction system."</p>

<p>As a part of the settlement agreement, county and city stakeholders had to form the Hinds County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council, which is working to ensure that people do not get stuck in the jails for too long and that cases move through the system quickly. The council meetings do not have to be public, Teeuwissen said, but he believes they will be in the near future.</p>

<p>The settlement agreement requires the county to recognize that "it must provide prisoners with adequate supervision and housing in order to prevent violence between prisoners and the use of excessive force by detention staff," the settlement agreement says.</p>

<p>"The county also acknowledges that government detention is a serious infringement on the rights of citizens and other individuals, and is thus subject to constitutional rights."</p>

<p>County leaders must work to decrease the incarcerated population "particularly special-needs populations, such as individuals with serious mental illness and juveniles," the settlement agreement says.</p>

<p>Teeuwissen said he thinks the council's work will be long-term.</p>

<p>"I think that what you're seeing now is a work in progress," he said.</p>

<p>The Hinds County Board of Supervisors voted to formally recognize the Hinds County Criminal Justice Coordinating Council on May 21.</p>

<p>The council is divided into five groups that will work on improvements to address behavioral health, case processing, jail population management, prisoner reentry and juvenile justice, a press release from the Administrative Office of the Courts says.</p>

<p>Senior Circuit Judge Tomie Green and Hinds County Administrator Carmen Davis co-chair the 19-member council.</p>

<p>The other council members include:</p>

<p>• Hinds County Circuit Court Senior Judge</p>

<p>• Hinds County Chancery Court Senior Judge</p>

<p>• Hinds County Court Senior Criminal Judge</p>

<p>• Hinds County Youth Court Judge</p>

<p>• Hinds County Justice Court Senior Judge</p>

<p>At a June 11 press conference, the City of Jackson announced that Michelle L. Thomas is stepping in to help the City through the budget process and assist Robert Blaine, the CAO and now interim director of the Department of Administration and Finance. Photo by Michelle L. Thomas</p>

<p>JACKSON — The woman who helped lead a budget turnaround in Newark, N.J., under then-Mayor Cory Booker will manage the City of Jackson's budget overhaul. Michelle L. Thomas, a financial expert with nearly 10 years of experience in both the public and private sector, will assist with day-to-day operations alongside Chief Administrative Robert Blaine, leading the City through the budget process.</p>

<p>Blaine is officially absorbing the duties of his recently departed colleague, Charles Hatcher, who resigned the finance post suddenly at the end of May.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba announced at a press conference last week that an interim director with a wealth of experience would be forthcoming. But Chief of Staff Safiya Omari told reporters on Monday that the City simply did not have the funds to hire Thomas for the position.</p>

<p>"We would love to have had Michelle as our interim director, but we can't afford her," Omari said.</p>

<p>Omari expressed excitement for bringing Thomas in, even on a temporary basis. "We're confident that she has the skills and the knowledge to move us through our budgeting period and also to address some of the other issues we're facing in the department of finance right now," she said.</p>

<p>Thomas began as Newark's director of innovation and performance management in 2006, and two years later, stepped into the role as interim business administrator.</p>

<p>Some city officials questioned Thomas' preparedness at first, as she had majored in African American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But after her success in the position, the Star-Ledger characterized Thomas as "the woman who steered the Newark budget through one of the worst economic crises in the city's history" in an article published after the city council unanimously confirmed her as business administrator.</p>

<p>Thomas cut Newark's deficit by $105 million, and she raked in $126 million in federal money for the City of Newark. She also focused on tax and fee collection.</p>

<p>In 2011, Thomas served as deputy mayor for operations in New Orleans under Mayor Mitchell Landrieu until she stepped down for personal reasons. Thomas made $164,000 in that role.</p>

<p>She then served as chief administrative officer and later interim executive director of the Louisiana Housing Corporation.</p>

<p>In the private sector as president of Thomas Consulting Group, she managed special projects for the Orleans Parish School Board, developed a five-year strategic financial plan for Hinds County and also for the Finance Authority of New Orleans, her LinkedIn page says.</p>

<p>Lumumba was out on vacation during this announcement, but the City provided a statement from him. "Ms. Thomas brings a wealth of knowledge and financial experience working with municipalities across the nation," the statement reads. "We are confident that she will continue to move our city forward in the interim."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus on Thursday endorsed a candidate in the Democratic primary runoff for a Republican-held U.S. Senate seat, but a caucus member who lost in the primary questioned the decision.</p>

<p>The caucus chairwoman, Rep. Sonya Williams-Barnes of Gulfport, said the 49-member group is supporting state Rep. David Baria of Bay St. Louis.</p>

<p>Rep. Omeria Scott of Laurel, who is a caucus member, placed third in the six-person Democratic Senate primary on June 5. She endorsed Baria's runoff opponent, venture capitalist Howard Sherman of Meridian, three days later.</p>

<p>Asked about the caucus endorsement of Baria, Scott told The Associated Press on Thursday: "Nobody's asked me."</p>

<p>Scott questioned whether the decision about the Baria endorsement was made according to caucus rules. Williams-Barnes did not immediately respond to an AP question about that.</p>

<p>Sherman finished slightly ahead of Baria in the first round of voting.</p>

<p>In the Nov. 6 general election, the Democratic nominee will face Republican Sen. Roger Wicker, the Reform Party's Shawn O'Hara of Hattiesburg, and Libertarian Danny Bedwell of Columbus.</p>

<p>Wicker has held the Senate seat since late 2007. Mississippi last had a Democrat in the U.S. Senate in January 1989.</p>

<p>All caucus members are Democrats, and African-Americans are a crucial part of the voting base that will choose a party nominee in the June 26 runoff.</p>

<p>Baria, an attorney, served one term in the state Senate before winning two terms in the House.</p>

<p>Williams-Barnes said in a statement that Baria has a legislative record of voting for education and mental health funding, and he has advocated expanding Medicaid, making changes to the criminal justice system and removing the Confederate battle emblem from the state flag.</p>

<p>"He is not shy when it comes to voting on issues ... which we favor or not favor," Williams-Barnes said. "He is with us, and for that, we the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, are proud to call him a partner in moving Mississippi forward."</p>

<p>Since the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations took over officer-involved shooting cases in Jackson in May 2018, there has been seemingly less information given out to the public because the state agency does not have to provide updates to those outside of law enforcement. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Just one month after Mississippi Bureau of Investigations officially began handling officer-involved shootings in Jackson, it has been harder to get information previously available to citizens and reporters following these incidents.</p>

<p>Mississippi Department of Public Safety Communications Chief Warren Strain, who now handles all communications concerning officer-involved shootings in Jackson, told the Jackson Free Press that it is MBI's policy not to discuss open or closed investigations with anyone who is not law enforcement or a district attorney.</p>

<p>On May 8, the Jackson City Council approved a memorandum of understanding between the City and the state agency. Just a half-day later, the Jackson Police Department reported the City's eighth officer-involved shooting since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba took office in July 2017. During a traffic stop around 1 a.m. on May 9, a JPD officer pulled over Elliot Reed and Chauncy Reed, apparently brothers, at the Valero gas station on Cooper Road.</p>

<p>Public Information Officer Sgt. Roderick Holmes said in a statement that the officer and the suspects exchanged fire. The officer did not suffer any serious injuries, but Elliot died at a local hospital following the incident. Chauncy, who survived, was charged with aggravated assault on a police officer and capital murder. Elliot is the third person to die at the hands of JPD in 2018.</p>

<p>Holmes' statement following this shooting was the last time reporters got information via email about developments in an officer-involved shooting, and this could be the reality going forward. Another one took place on June 1, but save for a tweet from JPD starved for critical information, there has been little other information about the shooting.</p>

<h1 id="jpdisatthesceneofanofficerinvolvedshootingthatoccurredin100blockofcalhounstmbiiscurrentlyatthesceneconductingtheinvestigationnoadditionalinfoavailable">JPD is at the scene of an officer-involved shooting that occurred in 100 block of Calhoun St. MBI is currently at the scene conducting the investigation. No additional info available.</h1>

<p>— Jackson Police Dept. (@JacksonMSPolice) June 1, 2018</p>

<p>"#JPD is at the scene of an officer-involved shooting that occurred in 100 block of Calhoun St.," the tweet reads. "MBI is currently at the scene conducting the investigation. No additional info available."</p>

<p>Holmes is aware of the concern that people will get less information following officer-involved shootings, but he cannot do much about it.</p>

<p>"That's out of our hands, because once (MBI) takes the investigation over, which as soon as it's an officer-involved shooting ... there is very limited information if an that we're able to release at that point because it is their active investigation," Holmes said.</p>

<p>Considering JPD likely never released the names of officers involved or the status of the investigation. The added lack of details from MBI compounds the information blockage.</p>

<p>The two aforementioned shootings are the only two officer-involved shootings MBI has investigated, despite Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba informing the family of Lee Edward Bonner at a city council meeting in March that MBI would be stepping in to handle that case.</p>

<p>'A Fact-finding Entity'</p>

<p>In the last couple of weeks, the mayoral-appointed officer-identification task force sent notice to MBI about the members' desire to bring in a speaker from the agency to discuss its investigative process, but has not yet received a response. Attorney CJ Lawrence, the chairman of the task force, said at the last meeting on June 4 that it gives the members reason to question transparency from MBI.</p>

<p>Strain told the JFP that the legal department is working on some kind of statement in response to the task force, but added that "typically MBI is not a policymaking entity; it is a fact-finding entity."</p>

<p>After three months of bi-weekly meetings, the task force has yet to delve into the City's use-of-force policy. However, the members said they will give the mayor their recommendations by the end of August.</p>

<p>A Bit of Sunshine</p>

<p>Despite less forthright information from City or MBI officials, some sunshine is peeking through to illuminate how the system works.</p>

<p>At a June 4 city press briefing, the mayor offered a glimpse into the officer-involved shooting on Calhoun Street. "We do know that one of the individuals involved in that admitted to firing at the officer," the mayor said.</p>

<p>Local media reported that the man injured in the shooting was taken to an area hospital with non-life threatening injuries and that the officer was not injured. No further information was made available by press time.</p>

<p>An April Hinds County grand-jury affidavit of no-bills surfaced last week, and it shows a failure to indict JPD officers who have killed citizens in at least three incidents since November 2017.</p>

<p>Officer Rakasha Adams was apparently involved in two of those deadly officer-involved shootings: one in November claiming the life of an unidentified man who allegedly brandished a knife at her, and the other in January, claiming the life of 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes.</p>

<p>The Barnes family hired a high-profile Baltimore-based attorney, Jason Downs, who served as legal counsel to the Freddie Gray family. At a press conference outside City Hall in May, Downs said he believed Officer Albert Taylor was the second person involved with the Barnes shooting, and he is listed on the "no bill" list under the same case as Officer Adams.</p>

<p>Downs, along with Mississippi attorney Carlos Moore, filed a petition on May 21 against the City of Jackson to retrieve the names of the two Jackson Police Department officers who were involved in the Barnes shooting following a traffic stop.</p>

<p>At press time, it is not clear if this no-bill list from April 2018 has any effect on Downs and Moore's demand for JPD to release the names of officers who shot and killed Barnes.</p>

<h2 id="howabrexitboysprojectendedupinjacksoncourt">How A ‘Brexit Boys’ Project Ended Up in Jackson Court</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-13</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/13/how-brexit-boys-project-ended-jackson-court/ </p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. — On a blistering Mississippi Tuesday, a camera crew followed Kyle Taylor, dressed in a tailored blue suit, from his attorney's downtown Jackson office to the Hinds County Chancery Courthouse. Taylor had flown to Mississippi to challenge the latest data project of two British companies, with ties to the U.K.'s "Brexit" campaign to leave the European Union.</p>

<p>The project was slated to be located at the University of Mississippi's Insight Park with the help of state dollars.</p>

<p>Taylor believes Eldon Insurance and Big Data Dolphins Ltd. might be using U.K. citizens' data in their new artificial-intelligence project they have planned to start in Oxford, Miss. Attorneys and principals at those companies deny transferring any data from the U.K. to Mississippi as a part of the project, however.</p>

<p>Arron Banks, a "Brexit" leader who co-founded the Leave.EU campaign with Andy Wigmore, owns Eldon Insurance, which started the Big Data Dolphins project.</p>

<p>In the third-floor courtroom, a local Baker Donelson attorney, Sterling Kidd, represented the two British companies. He sat with a British attorney, John Banks (who the Associated Press reported is kin to Arron Banks), and Victoria Sena, an Eldon employee tasked with managing the Mississippi project. Chancery Court Judge Denise Owens had a child-support case ahead of Taylor's, so both parties waited on opposite sides of the courtroom. Taylor sat with his attorney Dorsey Carson, who also does legal work for the Jackson Free Press, as well as Emma Briant, a British lecturer whose interviews with "Brexit" leaders became a part of Parliament's inquiry into "fake news." She would later testify in the hearing.</p>

<p>When it was Taylor's turn, videographers filming for a documentary project started their cameras.</p>

<p>Kidd made his clients' position clear early. Eldon and Big Data Dolphins believe that the Mississippi lawsuit is improper because it deals with U.K. companies and a U.K. citizen. Taylor is a dual-citizen of Canada and the U.S. who has been living in the U.K.</p>

<p>"No personal data of any British citizens has been transferred to Mississippi," Kidd told Judge Owens, emphasizing that besides the signed lease for Insight Park space, Big Data Dolphins has no operations at Ole Miss.</p>

<p>Investigations Across Waters</p>

<p>The Information Commissioner's Office, a public British agency that reports to Parliament, is investigating not only Eldon Insurance Ltd. but also Big Data Dolphins Ltd. The investigation is about how these companies might have used strategies including scraping and misusing U.K. citizen data. A letter saying so was not entered into evidence, but Carson gave the document to the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"The (ICO) investigation concerns the use of data and analytics methodology including the obtaining of personal information of U.K. citizens ... for the purpose of deploying targeted political advertisements in relation to the 2016 'Brexit' referendum, the alleged 'scraping' and misuse of data from millions of Facebook accounts in certain political campaign efforts, and whether any such conduct may have violated the British Data Protection Act of 1998, among other laws," the letter says.</p>

<p>The investigation springs from an inquiry into Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis group, that influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election, using scraped Facebook user data. Last week, Alexander Nix, former head of the group, admitted that the group did receive the Facebook data. Nix denied Cambridge Analytica's role in the "Brexit" election, however, Reuters reported.</p>

<p>Nigel Farage (here in Mississippi stumping for Donald Trump in 2016) spoke with Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore about the Mississippi case on his talk show this week.</p>

<p>Cambridge Analytica harvested more than 87 million American Facebook user profiles and their data during the 2016 presidential election. To scrape a user's data, it used third-party applications on the social-media network. How CA got access to so many users was tricky.</p>

<p>In 2015, some Facebook users clicked on a third-party application titled "This is Your Digital Life." When you use a third-party application, a pop-up box appears, asking you to give permission or access to some of your personal data. Users have two options—accept and allow the application to use all the data it lists, or decline and return back to Facebook without taking the quiz. Lots of Facebook users had their public profile, page likes, birthday and current city accessed if they clicked on the link. The catch was that even if you did not click on the link, if one of your Facebook friends did, your data was compromised, too.</p>

<p>The Parliamentary "Fake News Inquiry" is looking into whether or not U.K. citizens' data was similarly scraped and used to influence the "Brexit" election. In April, Brittany Kaiser, a former CA employee, testified before a parliamentary committee about her work at the data firm. She testified that Cambridge Analytica engaged with Banks and Wigmore to design parallel proposals for Leave.EU as well as Eldon Insurance. She took the lead on negotiations between CA and Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance, she said.</p>

<p>"Over a period of five months, we undertook both meetings and work at the Bristol headquarters of Eldon Insurance. ... Our work for UKIP/Leave.EU was never reported to the Electoral Commission by the party, the campaign or our company," she told the committee.</p>

<p>Banks denies Kaiser's testimony, and in front of a Parliamentary committee this week called her a "fantasist." Banks also said the committee had been "used by the Fair Vote campaign to push for a second referendum," the Guardian reported on June 12.</p>

<p>From 'Fake News' to Data Scraping?</p>

<p>Documents revealed in court, including emails between Eldon employees, show substantial plans for an artificial-intelligence data project at Ole Miss, including plans to "scrape social media data."</p>

<p>A parliamentary committee is currently investigating how "fake news" can influence elections, and Banks and Wigmore were scheduled for an oral evidence session in the U.K. on June 12. On June 8, Banks wrote a letter (tweeted out by Leave.EU) to the committee declining to testify and claiming that the committee is colluding with the Fair Vote project. "It is perfectly clear that the committee, which comprises only of Remain supporting MPs is conducting a co-ordinated 'Witch Hunt' of Leave groups, involving the Electoral Commission &amp; the ICO. You have called no witnesses from the Remain campaign or associated groups," Banks writes.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the letter, he listed "Facts" including that he met the Mississippi delegation at the Republican National Convention after the referendum, and they invited him to the state to meet Bryant.</p>

<p>"The project is still at the planning stage and has not commenced. No data was transferred to Mississippi from the UK," Banks writes. Banks and Wigmore changed their minds about not testifying to Parliament over the weekend after The Guardian published a story detailing documents that suggest that Banks met with Russian officials before the referendum. The two Leave.EU leaders have visited Mississippi before.</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant invited Banks and Wigmore, Nigel Farage and Lord Ashcroft to an Ole Miss football game last fall, a photo on Banks' Twitter account shows. Bryant said in an April statement that he initially suggested that the Big Data Dolphins project come to Mississippi. Plans for the project started as early as last fall.</p>

<p>Eldon officials and the University of Mississippi Research Foundation signed the lease for a new office to be built specifically for the project in February 2018. The lease said the foundation would pay for $100,000 of the construction, and the rest would be paid with a $100,000 grant from the Mississippi Development Authority.</p>

<p>MDA told the Jackson Free Press last week that it has not awarded that grant.</p>

<p>Victoria Sena testified in a quiet British accent before Judge Owens last week. She had written in her affidavit that Eldon representatives visited Oxford, Miss., twice in October 2017 to begin lease negotiations. Beyond that, she testified that nothing else has happened with data of any U.K. citizens.</p>

<p>"Neither Big Data nor Eldon have had or now have any equipment in Mississippi that would allow them to store the private data of British citizens there. Neither Big Data nor Eldon has, at any point in time, sent any personal data relating to citizens of the United Kingdom to the University of Mississippi, or to anyone else in Mississippi," she wrote in her affidavit.</p>

<p>Emails between Eldon employees show that the project would have included data scientists, marketing execs and a psychologist "working on projects to disrupt the market... Retailing through peer to peer groups and social media are areas where Arron sees opportunity," an email from Eldon employee Dave Taylor to Sena says.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Project</p>

<p>Big Data Dolphins staff were planning to work with Ken Cyree, the dean of the Ole Miss business school, and William Nicholas at Insight Park, the Big Data Dolphins' white paper, also released in court documents, shows.</p>

<p>"Within the first year of establishing a presence expectations are that the concept of establishing a presence at the Insight Park will be proven by the delivery of four to five AI projects across at least two of the above business areas," the white paper says.</p>

<p>Emails between Eldon employees show that Banks wanted to establish a "marketing focused AI office." The list of specific projects was sealed in the court record, but the rest of the emails are public record in court evidence. In an email from Dave Taylor, an Eldon employee, writes about the projects briefly.</p>

<p>"Arron would also like the team to acquire more sources of data and has mentioned that our plans to use software we have purchased (Kapow) to scrape social media data (Facebook profiles of our customers for starters) would fit in well with what is expected from Mississippi," the email says.</p>

<p>"We are already building up a sizeable data set but need to supplement with data from social media and analyse (hence the psychologist) to build up psychometric profiles we can adapt or build marketing campaigns to/for," Dave Taylor wrote in an Oct. 15, 2017, email to Sena.</p>

<p>The emails do not seem to prove that Big Data Dolphins or Eldon have transferred data to Ole Miss, but they do outline the plans for the project, which included building up data sets.</p>

<p>The companies were planning to recruit for the data-scientist positions through Mississippi Works, a website that lists jobs available in Mississippi. However, as Josh Gladden, the interim vice chancellor for research Ole Miss, testified in court last week, construction has not begun on the Big Data Dolphins office, despite the lease being signed in February.</p>

<p>MDA has not awarded its grant, either, implying that the project is currently stalled. Judge Owens asked attorneys to submit briefs by June 12. She will have to decide whether to extend the temporary injunction on the two companies or lift it.</p>

<p id="byline">by: Editorial Board</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-13</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/13/editorial-transparency-officer-shootings-needs-imp/ </p>

<p>It will not matter what Jackson's policies are on releasing names following officer-involved shootings because of MBI's code of silence. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Last month, with Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba's support, the Jackson City Council voted on a memorandum of understanding to have the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations handle officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths in Jackson. This threw an axe in the potential for any future progress concerning transparency from Jackson Police Department so long as the state agency is involved.</p>

<p>We now get even less information about the shootings. MBI does not have to disclose information concerning any open or closed investigations except to law enforcement. Considering the only information reporters and citizens got about the last officer-involved shooting was from a tweet on June 1, that policy is well-oiled and working as intended.</p>

<p>This decision also guts the mayoral-appointed officer-identification task force that has spent months meeting every two weeks to decide the best way to release details. The members' work and upcoming August policy recommendation could be futile now that MBI is handling these cases.</p>

<p>"We don't feel that it is a good practice to investigate yourself in these circumstances," Mayor Lumumba said on May 9.</p>

<p>The mayor is right, in part. Outside, unbiased investigations are better than internal investigations. However, bringing in the State will make transparency impossible because they do not have the same duties to report to journalists and citizens as JPD does. It will not matter what Jackson's policies are on releasing names following officer-involved shootings because of MBI's code of silence.</p>

<p>For a mayor who avoided a State takeover of his school district and who speaks openly about not wanting the State involved with the airport, it's surprising he was so willing to usher in MBI when it comes to officer-involved shootings. This is a subject matter he often claims to care about more than anyone else because he handled these cases as a lawyer before jumping into politics.</p>

<p>If the mayor would have just decided to lead the City through a policy change to releasing names, as he wanted to do before buying time with a task force, Jackson would not be in this information void. The likely result will be negative national publicity and more lawsuits forcing the names of officers into the public—as happened with a woman police officer involved in two shootings in a handful of months—because the City and the State seem determined to keep Jacksonians in the dark about officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>When Blake Feldman was in college, he planned on going to medical school. The Newton, Miss., native received a bachelor's degree in biology from the University of Southern Mississippi in 2011. However, after graduation he decided against the medical field and ended up going to University of Georgia School of Law instead.</p>

<p>At first, he thought he would focus on public-health law, but in a class during the first year, he began to see injustices in the country's criminal-justice system, particularly aspects of it in the Deep South.</p>

<p>He says he got lucky during his first semester when he got one of the best criminal-law professors at Georgia Law, Erica Hashimoto. In that class, she covered topics such as racial bias in sentencing and prosecutorial discretion (authority of an agency or officer to decide charges in a case and how to pursue it).</p>

<p>"Georgia Law isn't a super progressive law school," he says. "I was really shocked at really, really brilliant peers in my class who were unmoved by some things that I thought were just egregious."</p>

<p>That motivated him to change his elective to criminal procedure.</p>

<p>"Criminal procedure is really where you see the systemic breakdown of fair courts, especially for people of color and for low-income individuals," he says. "You just start out thinking like, 'Oh, the Fourth Amendment, this is such a great thing, and that it's just over the course of three months, you just see it chipped and chipped and chipped away."</p>

<p>He received his law degree in 2015 and decided to focus on advocacy and community organizing, and policy council and analysis. In July 2015, he wrapped up his assignments with the public defender's office in Athens, Ga., and that August, he became the advocacy coordinator for criminal justice reform at the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi. In that position, he often spent time at the Mississippi Capitol during the legislative sessions, and when he was not there, he worked with ACLU on policy advocacy at county and state levels, and assisted with developing litigation for class-action lawsuits.</p>

<p>He left the organization earlier this year and worked with Southern Poverty Law Center on a case and is doing policy advocacy consulting for a criminal-justice-reform organization Justice Collaborative LLC in Louisiana. For the next year, he says he wants to keep doing part-time advocacy and consulting.</p>

<p>John Perkins Photo by Delreco Harris</p>

<p>Each year around Father's Day, we honor men in the Jackson metro area who are making differences in our communities. This year's include leaders, policy advocates, south Jackson warriors, creators of welcoming spaces, social-media experts, and more. Meet the 2018 Guys We Love.</p>

<p>John P. Perkins</p>

<p>by Micah Smith</p>

<p>Before entering ministry, John Perkins, pastor of Common Ground Covenant Church, made a name for himself in the food scene. At age 22, he became the executive chef for the Eagle Ridge Convention Center in Raymond.</p>

<p>It was after he and wife, Patrice, got married in 2006 that Perkins says he wanted to be a spiritual leader for his family and turned to the Bible. As he began to fall in love with the scriptures, his grandfather, pastor John M. Perkins, founder of the John &amp; Vera Mae Perkins Foundation, began mentoring him.</p>

<p>In 2009, Perkins began working with his grandfather's ministry, and in 2010, he began leading the Spencer Perkins Center in west Jackson. Then, three and a half years ago, he launched Common Ground with the goal of expanding their efforts in the area.</p>

<p>"It's what we do for the kingdom that's going to last, and the work we do in west Jackson is solely trying to meet Jesus where he's already at work in our neighborhood and in our community," he says.</p>

<p>In addition to promoting local business, arts and education through events such as Community Nights, Thinker's Fair and Taste of West Jackson, the church has a variety of mission-oriented programs, including English as a Second Language tutoring at Pecan Park Elementary School. Common Ground also recently launched a web platform, "Church in Community," designed to share program results and provide tools for others to replicate them nationally.</p>

<p>"We are asking people to get in the game, and I think there are also people who want to do more than stack chairs," Perkins says. "We're finding those people, or they're finding us."</p>

<p>Ahmad Thompson</p>

<p>Ahmad Thompson, 33, along with Garrad Lee, Michael Milnick, Bradley Adair and Thompson's brother Saddi Thompson, saw a need for a diverse gathering place in Fondren—a place that would be welcoming for all, Thompson says. That idea became The Flamingo.</p>

<p>Thompson, who is originally from Crystal Springs, graduated with a bachelor's in marketing from the University of Mississippi in 2008 and moved to Jackson in 2010. It was around that time that he and Saddi took over their father's construction company, Thompson and Thompson Construction and Roofing, which has been in the Jackson community for more than 25 years. Thompson is the construction manager, while Saddi handles business and marketing.</p>

<p>Since The Flamingo's opening in fall 2017, the venue has hosted everything from art shows to concerts to trivia nights.</p>

<p>"It's a place that's welcoming for all races, genders, gender identities, sexual orientations, religion, things like that," Thompson says. "That's what we want The Flamingo to be—a place where everybody can get together, and we can express people's ideas through art and music and just general congregation without fear of persecution or things like that."</p>

<p>The Flamingo also partners with organizations such as Planned Parenthood to hold events and fundraisers.</p>

<p>"We are able to support causes that we believe in," Thompson says. "The Flamingo gives us a vehicle to allow people to express themselves in a healthy environment."</p>

<p>Blake Case</p>

<p>For Blake Case, it's important to help the community, and he understands the role social media can play in that. Case is currently the manager of marketing and public awareness for the Women's Foundation of Mississippi, which seeks to create economic security for women in the state.</p>

<p>Case graduated from Mississippi State University with a bachelor's degree in social studies in 2013. From March 2014 to May 2017, he served as the social media manager for 42 for Better Schools, which appeared on the November 2016 ballot for public school funding.</p>

<p>He started in his position with the Women's Foundation in September 2017. The organization dedicates itself to funding programs that better the lives of women and girls in the state. The nonprofit also awards grants to programs that aid in social change such as ones that decrease unplanned pregnancies through accurate, evidence-based sexual education. In his position, Case focuses on communications strategy, media relations, digital marketing and more.</p>

<p>He has also contributed to social media for The Parent's Campaign, a public-education advocacy group.</p>

<p>He sees a need for media- and social-media savvy people in the nonprofit and community advocacy sectors.</p>

<p>"We're still trying to catch up to 2018," he says. "There's a limited number of people who know the basics of digital and social media, so I feel like I've been useful. There's a real need in our area for communicators and media-enriched people."</p>

<p>John Ruckdeschel</p>

<p>When John Ruckdeschel made the decision during his medical training to be an oncologist, it was not as common as it is today.</p>

<p>"It was a need to do it, and it was different," Ruckdeschel says. "Nobody in the '60s wanted to be an oncologist. There just wasn't a whole lot to do for patients with cancer. There weren't very many chemotherapy drugs, and it was a whole brand new field."</p>

<p>For him, the field represented promise because doctors were just beginning to understand how cancer works.</p>

<p>However, Ruckdeschel did not always plan to go into the medical field. In 1963, he began studying aeronautical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Then, in his second year, he realized he didn't want to go into that field. He decided to take courses for a pre-medical degree to see how he liked it.</p>

<p>"Math was never intuitive for me," Ruckdeschel says. "I had to work at it. Biology and how biological systems and how the human body works, it's all intuitive. Once I know one piece of it, the rest of it just falls into place."</p>

<p>He graduated from Rensselaer in 1967 with a bachelor's degree in biology and then received a medical degree from Albany Medical College in 1971. That year, he also began his internal medicine internship at Johns Hopkins Hospital before moving on to an oncology fellowship at the National Cancer Institute from 1972 to 1975. Finally, he completed his senior residency in internal medicine at Beth Israel Hospital in 1976.</p>

<p>Ruckdeschel, 71, has held positions such as president and chief executive officer of Moffitt Cancer Center and the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, and medical director of the oncology program and services at Intermountain Healthcare. In 2017, he became the director of the University of Mississippi Medical Center's Cancer Institute. Ruckdeschel says that working at UMMC gives him the opportunity to do what he does best: build and direct cancer centers.</p>

<p>"I love being the conductor rather than the violinist or the trombonist or whatever, getting everybody to play together and to work together," he says. "Cancer is a team sport. It really is. It requires teams to take care of people."</p>

<p>When not working, he enjoys spending time with his wife, Angela, and family, and loves to cook, travel and bird-watch.</p>

<p>Ronnie Crudup Jr.</p>

<p>Ronnie Crudup Jr., executive director of New Horizon Ministries Inc., has been hard at work in recent days fulfilling his organization's goal of making life better for residents of south Jackson.</p>

<p>Crudup, 41, is a lifelong Jackson resident and graduated from Murrah High School before attending Belhaven University, where he received a bachelor's degree in history in 2006.</p>

<p>"My family moved to south Jackson when I was a junior in high school for my father's church," he says. Other than a three-year period in north Jackson, he has lived there ever since.</p>

<p>"I got involved in the south Jackson community because my whole working life has been here, my family is here, and my children go to the local schools. I want the same quality of life found in others parts of town to be here."</p>

<p>The most recent project for New Horizon Ministries has been renovating the Terry Road swimming pool, which Crudup says has been closed for the better part of two years. New Horizon received a memorandum of understanding from the City to work on the pool in April and has since been painting, fixing leaks and providing other necessary repairs.</p>

<p>"We had painted that pool and tried to fix it up a few years ago because it's not far from our center, and our kids used it," Crudup says. "When it closed, and they couldn't use it anymore, we decided to take responsibility for it for both our kids and our community."</p>

<p>He oversaw a project in October 2017 to hire a Nashville artist, who was in town working on other projects, to paint a mural representing the south Jackson community over a formerly graffiti-covered wall at Tennis Center South. He has also been working to demolish abandoned houses and turn the properties into something positive for the community.</p>

<p>"Two months ago, we demolished an abandoned house off of Martin Luther King Drive near Lanier High School, and we recently did another one," he says. "We brought in a local gardener and landscaper named Hazzard Miller to help turn the first space into a community garden, and now residents maintain it and grow cucumbers, watermelon, tomatoes and other summer crops there."</p>

<p>D.J. Baker</p>

<p>Much of D.J. Baker's life has revolved around the connection between healthy food and family, starting when he would help his mother in the garden growing up.</p>

<p>In 2015, Baker chose to leave his hometown of Edmond, Okla., where his family has lived for more than a century, and joined FoodCorps as a service member. The national nonprofit sent him to Mississippi, where he worked to provide children in low-income areas with access to healthy food.</p>

<p>"That was showing kids how to garden and grow their own food, how to prepare food; talking about the good, the bad, the ugly and the beautiful of food in our everyday world; having conversations about culture, about what that looks like in history and what that looks like now," he says.</p>

<p>While Baker left FoodCorps earlier this year, he has continued his efforts to further nutrition education and sustainable farming here in Jackson. Since June 2017, he has been partnering with farmer Felicia Bell on RD &amp; S Farm, working to grow a diverse, sustainable farm in Brandon. In addition to farming, RD &amp; S offers educational materials, workshops and agricultural consultations.</p>

<p>Baker also works with the Alliance of Sustainable Farms, a Mississippi-based nonprofit that works to connect farmers throughout the state who want to address issues of sustainability. Among other projects, the organization offers a farmer-to-farmer mentoring program, and hosts events to help highlight and introduce local growers to the community.</p>

<p>In February 2018, Baker launched his own company, Esculent, which aims to get more people involved with growing their own food, both through education and the installation of home fruit, vegetable and herb gardens.</p>

<p>"If the concept is growing for community, (you should) allow the communities to grow some for themselves," Baker says. "You're not going to have families that are going to go out and do whole farms for themselves, you know? ... But you can cut grocery costs, and this is an opportunity for families to literally grow together."</p>

<p>Alan Grove</p>

<p>For eight years before moving to Jackson, Washington native Alan Grove was already building friendships here, where his brother Bryan had moved.</p>

<p>About a year after receiving a bachelor's degree in comparative history with a certificate in sales and marketing from the University of Washington, Grove was working for a video-production startup in Seattle. He had a conversation with one of his Jackson friends, Pastor John Perkins of Common Ground Covenant Church, who was in Seattle at the time, and told him that he was unsure about what to do with his life.</p>

<p>"I didn't know if I wanted to do social entrepreneurship with my life or if I wanted to be a pastor," Grove says, "so in our conversation, he described how he was both."</p>

<p>In May 2015, Grove moved to west Jackson and became the church's operations and production director. While he had almost a decade of connections in the area, he says the first step in getting involved was to ask what he could do.</p>

<p>"I went from a startup video production company to then a church plant, and really, in those environments, you do what needs to get done," he says.</p>

<p>"A lot of it was just seeing the vision or the end goal of the project, and filling in the gaps the best you can, adapting if necessary."</p>

<p>Grove, 26, has helped coordinate many events to promote west Jackson and tackle issues, including the Jubilee Conference, which brought together community leaders in January 2018 to consolidate efforts to fight poverty and provide resources. The church will host a "Community Night" summer series, featuring free events such as the Gospel Explosion on June 14 and Hip-Hop in the Park on July 12.</p>

<p>Austin Baney</p>

<p>Austin Baney, head trainer and co-owner of CrossFit Fondren (3002 N. Mill St., 769-208-6704), first heard about CrossFit in college.</p>

<p>"I didn't use to be an athletic kid growing up, but I later found that fitness was a great personal outlet for my wellbeing," Baney says. "I ... fell in love with their approach to health and fitness in the community."</p>

<p>Baney, 24, was born in Memphis, Tenn., and his family has lived in Madison since 2005. He graduated from Madison Central High School and went on to Mississippi College, where he received a bachelor's degree in social studies education in 2015.</p>

<p>He worked as a social studies teacher at Hardy Middle School in Jackson during the 2016-2017 school year.</p>

<p>During that time, he also worked part-time as a CrossFit trainer at Coyote CrossFit in Madison. He had not considered fitness as a career path until Lewis reached out to him in search of someone to coach classes ahead of CrossFit Fondren's August 2017 opening.</p>

<p>Baney currently handles the center's day-to-day operations, including coaching classes and managing CrossFit's social media marketing.</p>

<p>"I believe that physical health is connected to mental, emotional and spiritual health, and our approach at CrossFit works to help a person as a whole when they come here," he says.</p>

<p>Baney lives in Flowood with his wife, Caitlyn Baney.</p>

<h2 id="governorvowstofightfostercaretakeover">Governor Vows to Fight Foster Care Takeover</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-06</p>

<p>JACKSON — Gov. Phil Bryant seemed prepared to fight to keep control over Mississippi's foster-care system last week after attorneys representing the children asked U.S. District Judge Tom Lee to hold the State in contempt of court and to turn over the system to a court-appointed receiver.</p>

<p>"You've got to remember that these plaintiffs' attorneys make a lot of money keeping this case going," the governor told reporters at the Capitol last week.</p>

<p>"They do not want to settle it; they do not want to admit that we are making tremendous progress in Child Protection Services, so we intend to vigorously go and defend our position and our belief that we are in compliance."</p>

<p>The more-than-decade-old lawsuit against the foster-care system had turned into one settlement agreement after another, with the state making some progress in recent years. That is, until May 31 when the attorneys moved for the takeover.</p>

<p>As the Jackson Free Press previously reported, the State is out of compliance with the agreement leaders entered into, and the primary source of non-compliance is meeting the required caseload percentages. As a part of the agreement between CPS and attorneys suing on behalf of foster-care children, caseworkers at CPS are only allowed to have a set amount of cases each in order to ensure that each child in foster care receives the proper attention and care.</p>

<p>Out of Compliance</p>

<p>When all parties in the long-running "Olivia Y" lawsuit agreed to let 2017 be a year of growth without consequences for CPS, a very new state agency at the time, the understanding was that the State would be in compliance with the necessary caseload requirements by the end of the year. The State made progress in that area—but then plateaued.</p>

<p>In the fall, and by December 2017, 61 percent of the State's caseworkers were meeting their caseload percentages. The agreement required 90 percent. Attorneys waited before dragging the State back into court. They met with Commissioner Jess Dickinson, who was in the midst of budgetary challenges, in March. Since then, caseload percentage compliance has actually declined, court records show.</p>

<p>"We think without adequate caseloads, nothing else is going to work out in any kind of way...," Marcia Lowry, one of the lead attorneys who works with A Better Childhood, said. "... They need caseworkers, and they do not have them."</p>

<p>Dickinson expressed his need for more workers back in March, when he also went to the Legislature requesting deficit funds for the current fiscal year. More workers would lower the caseload number, presumably, because there would be more workers to take on the State's shrinking number of cases. And even though the State has lowered the number of children in foster care by nearly 700 kids in the past year, its caseload percentage has gotten worse—it's at 52 percent as of May. Dickinson and CPS would not comment on the impending litigation beyond a statement.</p>

<p>"Mississippi's foster-care system has made great strides and recorded significant improvement since MDCPS was established in 2016. We are confident we are moving in the right direction to ensure the continued protection and safety of at-risk children and their families," the statement says. "We disagree with the plaintiff's assertions and will continue working diligently each day to care for the thousands of abused and neglected children entrusted into our custody for protection."</p>

<p>Need for 'More Funding'</p>

<p>CPS is an executive-level agency, and Bryant appointed Dickinson to replace former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice David Chandler, who led CPS for a year and a half, and retired in August 2017.</p>

<p>The governor is relying on the State's progress and track record to fend off receivership. He is proud of the fact that the number of kids in custody has dropped from more than 6,000 a year ago to 5,403 currently. But even with that drop in children, due to either adoption or reunification, the state's caseload compliance has not improved.</p>

<p>Lowry said the State's noncompliance is likely a combination of both the agency's inability to retain workers, as well as organizational structure and leadership.</p>

<p>"We're not trying to micromanage the agency; we've just set standards that they have to meet, and they are not meeting them," she said.</p>

<p>The new motion for contempt says that several top-level CPS workers have left or will leave the agency this month. It even suggests that Dickinson is not the right leader for CPS.</p>

<p>"As will be shown at the hearing on the present motion, it is apparent that Commissioner Dickinson is simply not capable of operating the agency in such a way to achieve compliance with the Court's requirements," the court documents say.</p>

<p>Beyond shifting personnel levels, CPS might need more funds. CPS originally requested more than $249 million in funding for fiscal-year 2019, which begins July 1. Dickinson told the Jackson Free Press that this amount is not nearly enough to pay caseworkers what he needs to keep them from leaving. The Legislature appropriated over $247 million to CPS, however, and even Bryant admits the agency could use more funding.</p>

<p>"I wish we had more funding. I will tell you that this is something we should fund above all other things, and we will see how the Legislature continues to deal with that," Bryant said last week. "We need to hire more social workers. They are actually hard to find, and this is a tough job. So if you get a new social worker who comes right out of a university and realizes how tough it is, we lose a lot of them."</p>

<p>Only one other foster-care system in the country has entered receivership: Washington, D.C., back in the 1990s. Lowry was a part of that case, too.</p>

<p>Receivership is a drastic step, one that Lowry says she tries to avoid. But in Mississippi, it is too late, she maintains.</p>

<p>Now a judge must determine the fate and control of the more than 5,000 children in the State of Mississippi's custody.</p>

<h2 id="turmoilinpelahatchiemayorboarddontagree">Turmoil in Pelahatchie: Mayor, Board Don’t Agree</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Marie Weidmayer</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-06</p>

<p>JACKSON — A former Pelahatchie city clerk choked back tears in the backroom of Penn's Fish House in Brandon, as she described the events that caused her to walk out of the job on March 7. Ruby Burns-Ward said Mayor Ryshonda Harper Beechem created an environment of fear in City Hall, so she left a job she loved.</p>

<p>"I told the aldermen, I will not work by myself with her (Beechem)," Burns-Ward said. "She would text us at all times of the night. Any little thing that you said to her would set her off. I lived in constant fear. All day long, it was like she would try to set you up."</p>

<p>Ward One Alderman Michael Adams, former Mayor Knox Ross Jr., retired City Clerk Bettye Massey, Mayor Pro Tem Margie Warren, along with Burns-Ward, sat down with for an interview with the Jackson Free Press and The Clarion-Ledger on May 30, the first time many of them spoke to media since the failed audit was announced.</p>

<p>The day before Burns-Ward walked out, along with the other city clerk, Ellen Davis, Beechem sent a letter to all city employees. Prior to sending it, she emailed a copy to her attorney Thomas Bellinder, documents show.</p>

<p>In the letter, Beechem said some employees have shown a level of disrespect, and as the mayor it is her duty to make sure they are "abiding by the law."</p>

<p>"I will not be held in violation for any of you not abiding by the rules. If any of you have a problem working with me or for me then you may and to find something else," the letter says. "Your conduct from this point on will not be accepted, and I will continue to do what's right and lawful."</p>

<p>Beechem said she wanted people to do their jobs because when she does not know what is happening in the town, it reflects poorly on her.</p>

<p>"You cannot get mad at not wanting to land myself in jail because whether it's me or anybody else, we have a job to do. If it's the law, it's the law and if it's a statue, it's a statue," she said.</p>

<p>The board hired Davis to a part-time city clerk position at its June 4 meeting.</p>

<p>Elected to office in June 2017 by a margin of 12 votes, Beechem is the first black mayor in the county. She reports to the Board of Aldermen, which consists of two black men, two white men and a white woman.</p>

<p>Adams, who is black, said the issues between the board and mayor are not because of racism. Instead, Adams alleges the mayor simply wants publicity.</p>

<p>"If it's not a black issue or a race issue, what is it?" the mayor told the Jackson Free Press. "That's the question that I have that no one can answer."</p>

<p>The Finance Audit</p>

<p>A month into her term, Beechem called the state auditor about Pelahatchie's use of drug-seizure funds. Now, current and former aldermen, city employees, Ross and Beechem owe more than $500,000 total to the state for the misuse of the funds, the audit found.</p>

<p>Aldermen say that they did not misuse the money. They say drug-seizure money was used for law enforcement purposes only, as the law requires. The money did not pay general expenses, the issue is there's a disagreement with how the money was accounted for, Ross said.</p>

<p>"They have done us a favor by putting on record that nobody stole any money and there's nothing is missing," Ross, the former mayor, said.</p>

<p>One issue the audit raises is how now-retired clerk Massey, who is white, was paid. She made about $82,000 a year, in a town of about 1,300 people. Ross said it is because she worked for the city for 30 years and had a workload for one and a half people. However, there was another full-time clerk, Burns-Ward, and one part-time clerk, Ward.</p>

<p>In Walnut Grove, a town of 1,900 people with a full-time mayor, the city clerk makes $38,000 a year. In Ackerman, a town of 1,500 with a part-time mayor, the city clerk makes just under $50,000. In Byhalia, a town of 1,300 people with a full-time mayor, the city clerk makes $57,638, a Mississippi State University survey shows.</p>

<p>"How can we afford $82,000, but you're the same city clerk saying 'we're broke, we're broke, we're broke?'" Beechem said. "If we don't have the money, then why pay? Out of 1,400 people, our residence did not increase to 5,000 people." The Disagreements</p>

<p>On Jan. 30, Burns-Ward, who is white, and Beechem argued over user IDs and passwords. She said Beechem yelled at her, saying Burns-Ward was not supposed to talk to the aldermen at all because Beechem was her supervisor. Burns-Ward then threatened to videotape Beechem and went to her office. Burns-Ward texted her husband, asking him to come to City Hall because she was afraid. Her husband came, as did Sgt. Timothy Fikes and Police Chief Keith Poole, Burns-Ward said.</p>

<p>Beechem told the Jackson Free Press she called Poole and asked him to come because she feared for her safety.</p>

<p>Warren was also at City Hall and went to talk to Beechem after the police arrived. "I open the door, and I go in, and she starts yelling 'Get out, get out, get out.' I say, 'what on earth is wrong with you?' (Beechem responds:) 'Get out. It's because of you and that mayor and that board.' She was slinging stuff off of her desk," Warren said.</p>

<p>Beechem said she never threw stuff. Instead, Beechem said Warren accused her of bugging the office phones.</p>

<p>"I asked her, 'Where are the bugs? Take me to them right now. Where are the bugs?'" Beechem said. "They couldn't move. (Warren responds:) 'You can't reason with her.' She walks out."</p>

<p>The Pelahatchie Municipal Court said there is no police report from that day. Police Chief Kevin Poole said he did go to City Hall that day, but did not file a report because no charges were pressed. When he responded, the mayor was upstairs and the city clerks were downstairs.</p>

<h2 id="correctionsfulfillsposteppsdirective">Corrections Fulfills Post-Epps Directive</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-06</p>

<p>Victor Cavett, a Mississippi Department of Corrections auditor, recently earned his universal certification for public procurement. Photo by MDOC</p>

<p>JACKSON — It has been almost four years since the Mississippi Department of Corrections was turned upside down after a federal grand jury indicted former Commissioner Christopher Epps on several counts of wire fraud, bribery and money laundering.</p>

<p>The grand jury indicted Epps and former Mississippi legislator Cecil McCrory on Nov. 6, 2014. The next day, Gov. Phil Bryant wrote an executive order directing the interim commissioner to rebid any contract that was caught up in the Epps scandal and ordered a comprehensive review of MDOC's contracting and procurement process. Gov. Bryant created a task force to examine MDOC's contracting process.</p>

<p>On July 31, 2015, Bryant issued another executive order, asking MDOC to become a "Certified Purchasing Office" by March 31, 2016. More than two years after that deadline, MDOC finally achieved that status late last year when Victor Cavett, an accountant in MDOC's purchasing office, received his universal certification as a professional public buyer.</p>

<p>Now MDOC is one of 10 certified purchasing offices in the state. Ross Campbell, director of purchasing, travel and fleet management in the Department of Finance and Administration, said the distinction allow an agency to issue a request-for-proposal for commodities or services. In MDOC's case, commodities contracts are predominantly with food and uniform vendors, Transparency Mississippi shows.</p>

<p>"If they want to do an RFP for commodities or services ..., they do not have to come to the board to get approval to do it," Campbell told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Even as a certified purchasing office, MDOC must still comply with state law and bring all contracts not characterized as "non-IT commodity" to the contract review board. MDOC, like all state agencies, must purchase from vendors registered with the state.</p>

<p>MDOC operates with a more than $341-million budget, and Cavett estimates that the agency could spend $100,000 or more in a week. The cost per inmate per day varies, but in 2016 was valued at $49.79, a 2016 Joint Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review report says. The cost for inmates in regional facilities and private prisons is lower than that. MDOC is required to spend less (10 percent) on private-prison inmates, state law says. With the number of incarcerated Mississippians hovering at around 21,000 and then 32,635 men and women on parole or probation, MDOC's costs are constant.</p>

<p>Cavett expressed the importance of maintaining independence when procuring contracts.</p>

<p>"We have to make certain that the items are competitively procured," Cavett said in a press release.</p>

<p>"That is to say, that we have enough quotes or submissions from vendors to ensure that we are getting good prices."</p>

<p>His caution is likely, in part, due to the governor's executive orders, as well as budget challenges. MDOC posted a budget deficit last year, causing the agency to scale back operations at South Mississippi Correctional Facility. Immediately after the 2018 legislative session, sheriffs gathered at the Capitol to complain about MDOC removing inmates from regional facilities, which sheriffs' departments statewide rely on for their own budgets.</p>

<p>Beyond commodity contracts, previously, PEER has encouraged MDOC to renegotiate the state's private-prison contracts with the Management and Training Corporation. In federal court earlier this year, MDOC officials revealed that the state's contracts with MTC and with medical provider, Centurion, required such low staffing levels that both MTC and Centurion additional staff beyond their contractual obligations at their own expense.</p>

<p>Separately, costs at MDOC largely reflect the inmate population, and after statewide criminal-justice reform in 2014, the number of incarcerated Mississippians dropped; however, in the past year, that number has inched back up.</p>

<p>Cavett is the primary contractor in the MDOC office and the only purchasing agent with universal certification.</p>

<h2 id="specialsessiontofundroadsbridgesmaydependonussupremecourt">Special Session to Fund Roads, Bridges May Depend on U.S. Supreme Court</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-04</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant said combining sports betting, online sales tax and state lottery revenues could come close to the needed amount to maintain the state's infrastructure funding. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant alluded to the possibility of a special session for infrastructure funding, if the U.S. Supreme Court allows states to start collecting use tax from online retailers.</p>

<p>Last week, he told reporters at the Capitol that he is watching how the U.S. Supreme Court decides the South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc. case, with a ruling expected this summer. If the high court reverses precedent from what is known as the Quill case, states can begin collecting use tax from online retailers. Currently, sales tax is only collected from brick-and-mortar retailers.</p>

<p>Many online retailers have started to collect the tax voluntarily. Amazon began collecting use tax from Mississippi shoppers last year, prompting Republican House leaders to propose several infrastructure funding legislative remedies that include diverting the new use tax to funds for roads and bridges.</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves has been skeptical about beginning to divert the use tax collected from online retailers to roads and bridges, citing constitutionality concerns in the past. But if the Supreme Court makes it legal, Bryant believes that is a green light for more road and bridge funding.</p>

<p>"(The Internet tax is) a tremendous amount of money that's being generated here in the state of Mississippi that we think could be identified for supporting infrastructure," Bryant said last week.</p>

<p>He also pointed to the Supreme Court's recent decision that allows states to legalize sports betting, which he said could generate around $30 million in revenue here in Mississippi. The governor also continues to support a state lottery.</p>

<p>"I believe a state lottery should be passed; I think we have the votes to do that," he said at the Capitol last week. "That could be anywhere between $70 (million) and $80 million. If you start putting those revenue numbers together, you're getting very close to the number I think that we need to support our infrastructure problems."</p>

<p>House Speaker Philip Gunn and Reeves could not come to an agreement about road and bridge funding during the 2018 legislative session, and following the session, Bryant was forced to close 83 bridges in the state after federal transportation officials threatened the state with losing federal funds if he did not.</p>

<p>Gunn does not support a lottery, and he formed a committee to study the lottery, which came to no legislative conclusion. The House body, however, successfully voted in favor of a state lottery this past session, although that provision was removed from the state gaming commission's budget bill in conference and did not become law. It is unclear how a lottery provision would hold up in the Senate, but Bryant said he had the votes in both chambers.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Economic Council released a report a few years ago estimating the state needs $375 million annually to repair and restore roads and bridges that have gone without upkeep since the last time the Legislature implemented a road program in 1987.</p>

<p>One proposal that will likely not come into play is raising the state's gasoline tax, which has remained flat since 1987 because it was not designed to adjust with inflation. Reeves has adamantly opposed tax increases, including on the gasoline tax. In April, Gunn proposed a "tax swap" that would eliminate the 4-percent income-tax bracket while increasing the gas tax.</p>

<h2 id="report110confederatemonumentsremovedinussince2015">Report: 110 Confederate Monuments Removed in US Since 2015</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-03</p>

<p>The study—released Monday by the Southern Poverty Law Center—shows that 110 Confederate monuments have been removed nationwide since 2015, when a shooting at a black church in South Carolina energized a movement against such memorials. Photo by Donna Ladd</p>

<p>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — It took generations to erect all the nation's Confederate monuments, and a new report shows they're being removed at a pace of about three each month.</p>

<p>The study—released Monday by the Southern Poverty Law Center—shows that 110 Confederate monuments have been removed nationwide since 2015, when a shooting at a black church in South Carolina energized a movement against such memorials.</p>

<p>The number—which includes schools and roads that have been renamed in California, a repurposed Confederate holiday in Georgia, plus rebel flags and monuments that have been taken down in Alabama, Louisiana and elsewhere—represents a relative handful compared with the more than 1,700 memorials that remain to hail the Southern "lost cause."</p>

<p>But the change is notable considering that removing such memorials wasn't widely discussed until the killing of nine black people at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, said Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a liberal activist organization based in Montgomery that monitors extremism. White supremacist Dylann Roof has been sentenced to death for the 2015 attack.</p>

<p>After the Charleston shooting, photos surfaced of Roof posing with the Confederate battle flag, helping to change the national dialogue.</p>

<p>"I think it kind of signifies something monumental," said Beirich, director of the organization's Intelligence Project. "I think people are finally willing to confront the history and come to terms with it."</p>

<p>Many of the Confederate monuments that are now controversial were erected in the early 1900s by groups composed of women and veterans. Some honor generals or soldiers; others bear inscriptions that critics say wrongly gloss over slavery as a reason for the war or portray the Confederate cause as noble.</p>

<p>The Old South monuments are supported by groups including the Sons of Confederate Veterans, which is erecting new memorials even as others are removed.</p>

<p>"They're taking them down, and we're putting them up," said Thomas V. Strain Jr., commander in chief of the organization. He said the group isn't tracking monument removals or name changes, but to him, 110 "seems a little high."</p>

<p>Members have raised two giant Confederate "mega-flags" on private property and erected four monuments in Alabama alone this year, Strain said, and they're asking to place a new Confederate monument outside the courthouse in Colbert County, in northwest Alabama. Commissioners are considering the request.</p>

<p>The organization also is building a new headquarters that will include The National Confederate Museum in Columbia, Tennessee. The organization, on its website promoting the project, said the museum will counter attempts by opponents "to ban any and all things Confederate through their ideological fascism."</p>

<p>The museum will tell the "Southern side" of the war, Strain said.</p>

<p>"It's not just dedicated to the soldiers, it's dedicated to the wives and children who had to endure that five years of hell also," he said. "We'll have Southern uniforms there, not Union uniforms. We'll have Southern artillery shells, not Northern ones."</p>

<p>Beirich said the law center's list of monument removals was compiled through news accounts, tips and crowd-sourcing sites that let people make online reports.</p>

<p>Both in tallying removals and remaining memorials, the group counted only monuments that "glorify" the Confederacy and didn't consider historical markers that denote specific events or sites with a link to the past, such as informative signs at battlefields, Beirich said.</p>

<p>While the organization lists 1,730 Confederate monuments nationwide, Beirich said there's no doubt a lot more exist.</p>

<p>"I am sure we have missed many," she said.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Grand jurors in Mississippi's most populous county have declined to indict four officers involved in recent shooting deaths.</p>

<p>Hinds County grand jurors declined to indict Rakasha Adams or Albert Taylor, two officers who grand jurors say were involved in the Jan. 27 shooting death of Crystalline Barnes. Family members of Barnes have alleged that officers were not justified in shooting the 21-year-old woman. Police say Barnes was driving her vehicle toward officers.</p>

<p>Jurors also declined to indict Adams in a 2017 shooting death.</p>

<p>Also not indicted were officers Roy Dickerson and Warren Hull. The Clarion Ledger reports the narcotics officers were investigating possible drug activity when they came in contact with two men who immediately ran. Police say 37-year-old Lee Edward Bonner was shot after he fired at officers.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi easily won a Republican primary Tuesday, months after being endorsed by President Donald Trump and the same day Trump tweeted that the legislator "has my total support!"</p>

<p>Wicker served nearly 13 years in the U.S. House before then-Gov. Haley Barbour appointed him to the Senate in late 2007 when fellow Republican Trent Lott resigned. Wicker's opponent in the November race isn't decided, as the Democratic primary heads to a June runoff.</p>

<p>Wicker, of Tupelo, defeated one GOP primary challenger who ran a low-budget campaign, business owner Richard Boyanton of Diamondhead.</p>

<p>Voter Mark Wall of Madison said he supported Wicker because of his conservative values and advocacy for the state: "He's done a lot to bring stuff to Mississippi that we need."</p>

<p>Six Democrats ran, and the top two headed to the June 26 runoff are state Rep. David Baria of Bay St. Louis, who looked to come in second place to venture capitalist Howard Sherman, who's married to TV and movie actress Sela Ward.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Wicker told The Associated Press: "It does seem based on statements coming from the various Democratic campaigns that opposition to the Trump agenda will be front and center in their emphasis. I don't think that sounds like a winner in Mississippi."</p>

<p>Mississippi is heavily Republican; it last had a Democrat in the Senate in 1989, when John C. Stennis retired.</p>

<p>Baria is an attorney and served one state Senate term before being elected in 2011 to the Republican-led Mississippi House, where he's now the Democratic leader. He criticizes Republicans for cutting taxes and refusing to expand Medicaid.</p>

<p>"The race now will be between a Mississippi Democrat and a California Republican," Baria said in a statement Tuesday night. "I'm ready for that race and I look forward to three more weeks of talking to the Mississippians I grew up with and have lived and worked with all my life."</p>

<p>Sherman and Ward raised their two children in Los Angeles, where he grew up, and the couple now lives near her hometown of Meridian, Mississippi. Sherman said Tuesday night that he had run against a "closed club" of experienced politicians who wrangled endorsements from other officeholders.</p>

<p>"All I had was a new way, a plan, accountability and a new Mississippi, and that's what people responded to," Sherman said.</p>

<p>As Sherman and Ward campaigned Tuesday at a soul food restaurant in Jackson, Ward told voter Harry Levy Jr. that Wicker has had a long career in Washington, serving in the House 13 years before moving to the Senate in late 2007 — and, she said, Mississippi is still poor.</p>

<p>"He's been in office 23 years, and we're still 50th," Ward said.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A district attorney and a former state development executive will meet in a runoff for the Republican nomination for an open congressional seat.</p>

<p>Michael Guest and Whit Hughes led the vote-getters Tuesday in the Republican contest in Mississippi's 3rd Congressional District.</p>

<p>Hughes said at his election watch party, "I've always been an underdog... if I make a runoff, I promise we'll be ready for it." The Jackson Free Press told him as he came off the stage that he had, indeed, made the runoff. He said he's not afraid to be the underdog going into it.</p>

<p>Guest is chief prosecutor in the Jackson suburbs of Madison and Rankin counties.</p>

<p>Hughes was deputy director of the Mississippi Development Authority under Gov. Haley Barbour after serving as his campaign finance director for his 2003 campaign. He's now a fundraiser for the Baptist hospital system.</p>

<p>Both attended Mississippi State University, where Hughes was a basketball player. Guest also received his law degree from the University of Mississippi.</p>

<p>They led four other candidates Tuesday, with no one winning a majority.</p>

<p>The district has been represented for 10 years by retiring Republican Gregg Harper.</p>

<p>Hughes and Guest were the top two fundraisers, with Hughes raising $430,000 and Guest raising $400,000.</p>

<p>The winner of the June 26 runoff faces Democratic state Rep. Michael Ted Evans of Preston and Reform Party member Matthew Holland of Hattiesburg in November.</p>

<h2 id="bodycamscommunitypolicingmentalhealthfundsonjpdsdojwishlist">Body Cams, Community Policing, Mental Health Funds on JPD's DOJ Wish List</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-30</p>

<p>In an interview, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore talked about securing body cameras and working on community policing. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Jackson Police Department hopes to equip its officers with body cameras and increase its "community policing" capacity with funds from U.S. Department of Justice. Pending grant applications also ask the DOJ for assistance with mental-health training.</p>

<p>Funds for body cameras would come from the U.S. Department of Justice's Body-Worn Camera Policy and Implementation Program. The grant requires a 50-percent match fund match, and JPD has requested $600,000 from the DOJ.</p>

<p>"The (Body-Worn Camera Policy and Implementation Program) addresses the development and implementation of policies and practices for effective program adoption, and includes factors such as the purchase, deployment, and maintenance of camera systems and equipment; data storage and access; and privacy considerations," the program description reads.</p>

<p>Officer-involved shootings have plagued Jackson in the last year, with at least seven since last July. JPD does not traditionally identify officers who fire on residents or the specific circumstances of the incidents. Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has convened a task force to recommend an updated policy on officer-involved shootings, which has met for two months to date.</p>

<p>The Jackson City Council unanimously gave its support to the body-camera application due on the last day of May. But, some brought up concerns about policy around the cameras should the City receive them.</p>

<p>"People have a right to privacy," Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps said at the May 22 city council meeting. "If a police officer shows up to a domestic situation, should the public be able to do an open-records request for those moments?"</p>

<p>Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes said he hopes the grant helps with community trust.</p>

<p>Body cameras, while helpful in some cases, are not cure-alls. A BuzzFeed News investigation from January 2017 titled "Blue Lies Matter" showed that video evidence opened a floodgate into the reality that sometimes officers tell a different story from what the cameras reveal.</p>

<p>"Cameras prove cops lie, and there are more cameras out in the world today than ever before," BuzzFeed reporter Albert Samaha wrote in the article. "... Officers lie in high-profile cases and little-known cases, and lie by fabrication, omission and exaggeration." Mitigating Risks of Body Cameras</p>

<p>The nation saw broader demand for body cameras following the Michael Brown shooting in Ferguson, Mo., as an unbiased intermediary to reveal the facts of a case. A 2017 report on body-worn cameras points to the benefit of transparency, but the need for policies to protect the community.</p>

<p>"[C]ameras could be used to intensify disproportionate surveillance and enforcement in heavily policed communities of color," The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights &amp; Upturn report reads. "Without carefully crafted policy safeguards in place, there is a real risk that these new devices could become instruments of injustice, rather than tools for accountability."</p>

<p>The city council also approved JPD to move forward with an application for The Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program under the DOJ. This grant program would give JPD the funds to "support cross-system collaboration to improve responses and outcomes for individuals with mental illnesses or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse who come into contact with the justice system."</p>

<p>The DOJ program description also points to the national surge in suicides and how untreated mental illness can lead to self-injury. In 2016, more suicides than homicides occurred in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Community Policing: Proactive Efficiency</p>

<p>The council also approved the police department moving forward with a grant to help the City implement community-policing strategies. The DOJ's Community Policing Development funds will give up to $10 million subject to availability to fund projects related to "increase awareness of effective community policing strategies, increase the skills and abilities of law enforcement and community partners, increase the number of law enforcement agencies and relevant stakeholders using proven community policing practices and institutionalize community policing practice in routine business," the application description reads.</p>

<p>"Community policing" is a popular buzz phrase in law enforcement that is often used just to indicate police interacting with the community more often, but crime experts warn that there is much more to community policing if meaning change is to result.</p>

<p>The Community Oriented Policing Services division of the DOJ has explained that it is a strategy for law enforcement to be "proactive" rather than to just react to crimes after they occur or with traditional police practices.</p>

<p>"Community policing emphasizes proactive problem solving in a systematic and routine fashion," the COPS website explains. "Rather than responding to crime only after it occurs, community policing encourages agencies to proactively develop solutions to the immediate underlying conditions contributing to public safety problems. Problem solving must be infused into all police operations and guide decision-making efforts. Agencies are encouraged to think innovatively about their responses and view making arrests as only one of a wide array of potential responses."</p>

<p>In many cities, including New York City, community-policing strategies have resulted in an overhaul of the police beat system, with more officers walking the streets of neighborhoods rather than riding in squad cars in order to react better with residents and potential criminals. This can increase intelligence gathering and builds better relationships, including with young people at risk of making poor decisions.</p>

<p>It also means looking harder at the causes of crime in order to prevent them. "Community policing puts new emphasis on tackling the underlying causes of crime by addressing problems at the grassroots level," a DOJ Bureau of Justice Assistance report explained.</p>

<p>In order for police to better ineract with the community in ways that might prevent crime, they require more training and, often, a shift a mindset about police work. The public must think about policing differently as well, including only using 911 to report true emergencies.</p>

<p>"To maximize the time that the patrol officer can spend interacting with community members, community policing encourages the use of the 911 system only for true emergencies. Nonemergency calls should be handled through other means, including delays in responding and report handling by the police station or sheriff's office over the telephone or by mail," that report said.</p>

<p>Good systems are key to community-policing success, as are adequate resources to overhaul dated law-enforcement strategies. "Efficiency must be built into each aspect of the community policing strategy—from the creation of community boundaries that cultivate productive alliances to the adoption of technologies that increase communication," the BJA report said. "Expanded and thorough training is paramount in an efficient shift to community policing. Intensive training, although initially costly in terms of dollars and time, will eventually make the process more efficient, as well-trained and experienced personnel share practical knowledge with colleagues."</p>

<h2 id="cityfinancedirectorannounceslastdayduringharshauditreport">City Finance Director Announces Last Day During Harsh Audit Report</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Marie Weidmayer</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-31</p>

<p>Department of Finance and Administration Director Charles Hatcher addressed the Finance Committee on May 31, confirming that it was his last day with the City of Jackson. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Charles Hatcher's last day with the City of Jackson is today—Thursday, May 31.</p>

<p>The director of the Department of Finance and Administration's departure surfaced publicly for the first time at a Finance Committee meeting this afternoon, while the committee discussed why the budget audit—started in November 2017—is not complete.</p>

<p>The news broke today when Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote asked Hatcher if the department was prepared for his departure.</p>

<p>"Dr. Hatcher, we have enjoyed your time with us," Ward 2 Councilman Melvin Priester Jr. said. "It might be contentious, but it's the situation Jackson's in and its passion. But thank you very much and good luck."</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba was not at the meeting. He told the Jackson Free Press via text that he is en route to the 2018 Labor Research and Action Network national conference in Nashville where he is a keynote speaker.</p>

<p>However, "there is a plan in place" for Hatcher's departure, Lumumba texted the Jackson Free Press, but he did not elaborate. He said a city representative would contact the JFP to discuss Hatcher's departure but that did not happen by press time. However, a statement arrived in email within an hour, saying that Hatcher had resigned for "personal reasons."</p>

<p>The statement did not name an interim director, however. "We have identified an individual to step in and serve in Dr. Hatcher's stead until a permanent replacement can be found," Lumumba said in the statement. "This individual has an abundance of financial experience working with municipalities across the nation, and we are confident that they will continue to move our city forward in the interim."</p>

<p>Hatcher is leaving the city one month before the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (CAFR) is due to Government Finance Officers Association (GFOA), on June 30. Auditor Scott Hodges said at the budget meeting that Tann, Brown and Russ Co. is prepared to work with Hatcher's staff after his departure.</p>

<p>The audit started in November, but a lack of information given to the auditors from the City slowed the process down. Originally, the audit was scheduled to be completed in January, Hodges said.</p>

<p>"There's nothing we're asking for that shouldn't be readily available if the internal controls were in place and proper processes were in place," Hodges said. "This is all stuff that should have been done monthly. So from that standpoint at the end of October, all of this information should have been ready, if it had been done properly throughout the year as it should have been done."</p>

<p>Auditors discovered numerous discrepancies during the audit, but until it is complete, it is impossible to know the total number of discrepancies or how much it amounts to, as they could increase or decrease, Hodges said.</p>

<p>Technically the audit doesn't indicate fraud, Hodges said, but added that there's more to it than that. "The CAFR has been produced and signed off on by multiple people, so if that's fraud, that's every man's definition," he said.</p>

<p>There are material weaknesses "everywhere I look," Hodges said. A material weakness is one or more deficiencies with the reasonable possibility that mistakes on a financial statement cannot be prevented or detected, according to the Public Accounting Oversight Board.</p>

<p>If the audit was to be completed today, the City would receive an adverse opinion, which means its financial statements do not fairly represent the actual financial position, Hodges said.</p>

<p>"It's kind of a big deal, but getting an adverse opinion would be a bigger deal," Priester said. "I would like as we go through this, I hope sooner than later we get a better ideal for scope of any revisions and how far they go back."</p>

<p>In his statement, Lumumba wished Hatcher well. "We appreciate the hard work and innovation of Dr. Charles Hatcher during his tenure as director of the Department of Administration. His resignation was fueled by personal reasons. We wish him the best in his future endeavors," the statement said.</p>

<p>Hatcher's salary was just over $105,000—approximately a 24-percent increase over the woman in that role under Yarber, Michelle Battee-Day.</p>

<p>JACKSON — At least six people in Mississippi and Texas could face life in prison after a group of federal, state and local law enforcement seized more than 40 kilograms of methamphetamine, 3 kilograms of cocaine and 100 pounds of marijuana near Philadelphia, Miss., on May 30 in a coordinated drug raid. Federal agencies involved in the raids include ICE's Homeland Security Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, along with multiples local agencies.</p>

<p>"These arrests are the culmination of an extensive Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force investigation dubbed 'Operation Highlife,' which targeted illegal narcotics distribution in this part of our state," U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst said at a press conference in the federal courthouse in downtown Jackson Thursday. "This particular illegal drug activity has been occurring in the East Central Mississippi area for the last several years."</p>

<p>The task force arrested 11 people, with their indictment unsealed Wednesday. Their arraignment is June 1.</p>

<p>At least 15 federal, state and local law enforcement organizations worked together for the task force, which covers Texas, California, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, Hurst said.</p>

<p>"These arrests and the dismantling of this drug-trafficking network is exactly what the OCDETF program was created to do," Hurst said. "As you can see this was a complete joint effort that led to the success and the arrest yesterday."</p>

<p>To end this trafficking ring effectively, it had to be hit all at once, not just arresting individual purchasers or dealers, Hurst said.</p>

<p>"I think the message is clear that we are not going to stop. We're going to come together, we're going to work together with law enforcement across county lines, across district lines," Hurst said. "When we come together there is no one that can avoid us, there is no one that can hide from us and we're going to make sure that we put an end to this kind of criminal activity in the Southern District of Mississippi."</p>

<p>The arrests only represent accusations, and those charged are innocent until proved guilty. "Operation Highlife" arrested the following 11 people:</p>

<p>Brandon Deshanta Miller, 32, of Dallas, Texas, is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth, possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth and felon in possession of a firearm. Miller faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $30.25 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Shandlette Hudson, 42, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth and possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth. Hudson faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $20 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Dijon James Seales, 28, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth, possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth, possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of meth, felon in possession of a firearm and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime. Seales faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $25.5 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Lorenzo Dyrell Hickman, 32, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine. Hickman faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $20 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Latrice Cherrell Boler, 29, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth. Boler faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $10 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Chaddis Demond McAfee, 36, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of meth, felon in possession of a firearm and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. McAfee faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $10.5 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Courtny Orlando Campbell, 27, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth. Campbell faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $10 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Danny L. Drake, 43, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth. Drake faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and up to a $5 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Kevin Ashley Wells, 37, of Philadelphia, Miss., is charged with possession with intent to distribute five grams or more of meth. Wells faces a maximum penalty of 40 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>Jimmie Terrell Harrison, 43, of Forest, Miss., is charged with felon in possession of a firearm. Harrison faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and up to a $250,000 fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Tray Beamon, 32, of Louisville, Miss., is charged with possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth and conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of meth. Beamon faces a maximum penalty of life in prison and up to a $20 million fine, if convicted.</p>

<p>Hurst, appointed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, announced a coordinated, late-night "surge" inside Jackson in April as part of what he dubs "Project Eject." He later announced 45 arrests for a mix of drug, gang and weapons charges. The Jackson Free Press has requested the names of the people arrested and their charges multiple times, including at the press conference for "Operation Highlife," but Hurst has declined repeatedly to provide that information.</p>

<p>"Project Eject" is part of Sessions' return to a "Project Safe Neighborhood" strategy of federal arrests for gun charges and his pledge to renew emphasis on drug enforcement.</p>

<p>Update: The Green Eyeshade Awards from the southeastern division of the Society of Professional Journalists, announced Friday, June 8, that the Jackson Free Press has won "Best in Division," one of the contest's top awards, for our juvenile-justice reporting and commentary in 2017. This is the second year in a row the JFP has taken "Best in Division" for work related to young people and violence prevention in Mississippi. This brings the JFP's total Eyeshade awards to six this year, which includes the public-service award for juvenile justice work announced previously.</p>

<p>Reporters Ko Bragg and Arielle Dreher, along with editor-in-chief Donna Ladd, took first place in public service in the non-daily news division for the team's reporting in 2017 on juvenile justice in Mississippi. The award honored 15 stories and columns last year about failed efforts to expand the state gang law; the effort for criminal-justice reform in the Legislature, the lack of resources for young people needing mental-health and trauma treatment; the lack of violence prevention for young people growing up in poverty; the lack of evidence-based policing strategies, and even how scientific racism has influenced today's juvenile-justice policy.</p>

<p>The recognized public-service work also included Ko Bragg's investigation of the Jackson Police Department's distribution of juvenile mugshots and allowing select "perp walks" for media cameras, including of unconvicted juveniles. Her work prompted Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba to sign an executive order stopping those practices.</p>

<p>Last year's Green Eyeshade Awards also honored the JFP's ongoing juvenile-justice work, which has been supported in recent years by fellowships and grants from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, the Quattrone Center at Penn Law and the Solutions Journalism Network. Donna Ladd's long-form "Hunger to Live" story series on the Washington Addition won Best in Division in 2017, with photojournalism by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>In the 2018 awards, the JFP also won the following four awards, continuing the tradition of the locally owned news outlet being one of the top awards recipients in the competition as well as the top Mississippi winner. The JFP also continued its tradition of winning Green Eyeshade Awards for editorials and commentary:</p>

<p>• Editorials, 2nd place: JFP Editorial Board, Editorials 2017</p>

<p>• Feature writing, 3rd place: Arielle Dreher, "Still Fighting at Home: Transgender Veterans Caught in</p>

<p>the Flux"</p>

<p>• Courts and the Law reporting, 3rd place: Ko Bragg, "Hinds DA on Trial, Again"</p>

<p>The Green Eyeshades includes journalism by daily, non-daily, TV, radio, college and online-only outlets in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia. It will announce its best of division awards the week of June 4.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A Mississippi police officer has been fired after being accused of using excessive force against a 19-year-old basketball player.</p>

<p>Interim Jackson Police Chief Anthony Moore said officer Vincent Lampkin was fired after an "extensive investigation," and asked citizens not to judge the entire department by "one bad actor."</p>

<p>John Knight III told authorities that the officer pulled him over in May and attacked him as he got out of his vehicle. He said the officer handcuffed and punched him, put a gun to his head, threw his phone into the grass when he asked to call his father, and then ultimately let him go without charges.</p>

<p>Knight, a standout point guard, was pulled over and beaten only a week after Utah State signed him to a scholarship.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press reached out to all candidates in the four Mississippi Congressional districts who are listed on a primary election ballot on June 5, regardless of whether they had a challenger or not. Each candidate received the same five-question questionnaire. We've published their responses in full below, with minimal edits for editorial/reader clarity only. The JFP did not copyedit or line-edit candidate responses. The views expressed by candidates do not necessarily reflect the views of the JFP.</p>

<p>Why does your district need you right now? </p>

<p>For too long equal representation has been inaccessible to the common citizens of Mississippi. Unless you are big business, a healthcare executive or already in the government; the average Mississippian’s voice has not been heard. I am tired of the politicians dividing and bullying the people of our State. My district needs people that will stand up against inequality and injustice. We need accountability and transparency for our elected. I cannot undertake this alone, I need your help. If you want to make a difference, if you feel called to be a part of a movement, or you want to be a part of the future; I am asking that you join us and volunteer. Join our team and let us make a difference. Click on the Volunteer button on the www.aycoxforcongress.com and let us change Mississippi together.</p>

<p>Provide one or two examples of when you have been an advocate in your personal or professional life. </p>

<p>While stationed in Jacksonville Florida serving in the US NAVY I served as a SAPR (sexual assault prevention and response) advocate. This role was established as a collateral duty to serve as a liaison for victims of Military Sexual Assault Trauma. I had numerous cases, where I served as a liaison on behalf of the victim to the command, the legal teams, investigative services, or whomever. While there have been many things that spark the desire to advocate on behalf of others, this was one of the most humbling experiences of my adult life. To be the strength for the weak, the punching bag for the angry, and the courage for those who have lost comfort within themselves.</p>

<p>What is the most pressing issue for your district (or state)? </p>

<p>In one word opportunity. Jobs, education and Healthcare. If you are employed in Mississippi and you compare your wage to that of other states. You will learn that Mississippians are underpaid. However, many in Mississippi, are underemployed. I want to see Mississippi possess research, development, and technological jobs that stimulate growth. I want the see education attainable at low/ no cost to our citizens who strive for good grades. I want Mississippians to have quality healthcare that is low to no cost for Mississippians. We have an obligation to take care of our people and it is time we start doing so.</p>

<p>If you could propose one piece of legislation that would greatly improve the quality of life for people your district what would it be?</p>

<p>Have you ever heard about Interstate 14 also known as the 14th Amendment Highway? This was a proposed interstate highway that has started in Texas and is working its way across Louisiana and Mississippi.</p>

<p>This is where my fight will begin in the House. I believe that the creation and funding of this Interstate Highway System will not only stimulate growth for the Southwest region of our District but also stimulate the state economy by providing jobs and opportunity along the way.</p>

<p>If you are unsuccessful in winning your race, how specifically will you continue working on behalf of your district (or state)?</p>

<p>We are going to win, why would we think otherwise?</p>

<p>I have always stood up for the little guy. Our elected have an obligation to take care of our people. Their primary purpose is to serve! When you cross into Natchez, Mississippi the sign reads “service before self.” This should be the motto of every politician; local, state, or federal and they should utter those words daily as a reminder of their position. I will continue to fight for equality, against injustice, and for Mississippi.</p>

<h2 id="cityblowingthroughitsfundbalance">City Blowing Through Its Fund Balance?</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-30</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/30/city-blowing-through-its-fund-balance/ </p>

<p>Director of Finance and Administration Charles Hatcher said his office is most concerned that groups can ask the city council for funds, without a process. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Jackson City Council meetings are falling into a chaotic pattern—the later it gets into the meeting, the more likely you are to see a show-stopping argument between members of the council. Now it seems the disorganization has potential to put the City's fund balance at risk.</p>

<p>The infighting during May 22's meeting involved both the budget and racial tensions. Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes proposed an item for the council to authorize a grant worth $15,000 to support the annual Farish Street Heritage Festival. Although the City tends to support the festival, it was not included ahead of time as a line item in the budget.</p>

<p>Ward 2 Councilman Melvin Priester Jr. said he did not travel last year because he knew something would come up, and he ended up finding the money for the Farish Street Festival in the city clerk's budget.</p>

<p>At voting time, Stokes had not yet determined where in the budget the money would come from. Alberta Gibson and Lee Davis, who chair the festival pled their case before the council and the mayor to get financial support for the two-day festival.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba, who said he supports Farish Street and the festival, wants to return to a request-for-proposal process instead of having people come to council meetings to persuade the members to find money, especially when he hopes to use some of the City's fund balance, also called the emergency or "rainy day fund," to help out with youth programming in particular. Lumumba encouraged the Farish Street representatives to come to budget hearings this summer so that they can be included more formally next time.</p>

<p>"We do all this politicking at a later hour when were talking about going into an emergency fund. ... [W]e have some very real emergencies," the mayor said.</p>

<p>Ward 7 Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay said that she would offer assistance with fundraising for the festival, but that she was concerned about being fair.</p>

<p>"The question remains is just this: ... it's your festival today and another festival tomorrow, and who decides which festival we choose to fund out of the fund balance?" she said. "It is truly a question of fairness in my mind. That's all."</p>

<p>The council voted 5-2, with Lindsay and Ashby Foote of Ward 1 voting nay. The council had moved on to yet another item—the Jackson Music Awards—that could cost the City $10,000 if the council approves the budget revision Stamps said he will present at the next meeting. Although the council was set to move on to yet another item that ended up drawing $6,000 from the fund balance, Stokes brought the conversation back to Farish Street.</p>

<p>"You've got to look at the City, how people feel when they watch these council meetings," Stokes said. "Two whites vote against Farish Street, and then we say we're working on race relations? Somebody's gonna say it. Imma say it." He was referring to Foote and Lindsay.</p>

<p>"The people are not saying that," Priester chimed back.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are saying that," Stokes said, repeating himself louder.</p>

<p>"You are making it worse by—" Priester began before Stokes interrupted.</p>

<p>Stamps gathered his things and left the council meeting for the night.</p>

<p>"No, I'm telling it like it is," Stokes said. "You go down State Street and see all the work going on in Fondren, but yet you can't support Farish Street?"</p>

<p>Council President Charles Tillman of Ward 5 rapped his gavel down.</p>

<p>"I'm tired of it being this level of discourse," Priester said.</p>

<p>"You can be tired, but it's the truth," Stokes said. "And the truth is going to keep coming out. The white areas are getting better than the black areas in this city, and this is a black-majority city. It ain't right."</p>

<p>"I would just add that the work is going on in your ward," Mayor Lumumba said to Stokes.</p>

<p>There could be serious repercussions if the council continues to spend money in the fund balance, which the City might need to use to repay its debts very soon.</p>

<p>Charles Hatcher, the director of the Department of Finance and Administration, believes that the city council will move the money from the fund balance to go toward Farish Street, although he does not necessarily support it.</p>

<p>"The principle that most disturbed the administration is that you can ask for money without a process," Hatcher told the Jackson Free Press. "All you need to get money from the council is four votes. That doesn't seem like good government."</p>

<p>Hatcher estimates that the City has around $12 million unassigned in the fund balance, and although sums such as $15,000 pail in comparison, there is a bigger picture—and it's a scary one.</p>

<p>"When you look at how much we're going to need to spend, and how much (we're) going to make in the next six years, that fund balance is going to evaporate in the next three years," Hatcher said. "[W]e need a strategy for building it up. It undermines that effort when we pick away at it."</p>

<p>The council also recently approved a raise for the part-time city clerks that drew nearly $117,000 out of the fund balance, causing uproar among City employees.</p>

<p>If the City goes into a negative fund balance, it would be insolvent, and the State of Mississippi could get involved.</p>

<p>Hatcher brings up six years a lot, and it's intentional. Jackson could be "out of the woods" concerning major debt payments to bondholders by 2024. However, in the meantime, Hatcher hopes to drive home the importance of more revenue and guarding the fund balance.</p>

<p>Like the mayor, Hatcher said cutting into the fund balance like the council has been doing, is like having a lot of money in your wallet but a big credit-card bill, so it becomes irresponsible to spend the money in your wallet.</p>

<h2 id="rankinsfirstblackmayorfacessetbacks">Rankin’s First Black Mayor Faces Setbacks</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-30</p>

<p>Pelahatchie Mayor Ryshonda Harper Beechem and her lawyer Thomas Bellinder held a press conference May 23 to discuss the state auditor’s demand for the town to repay $500,000. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — Pelahatchie Mayor Ryshonda Harper Beechem sat at the head of a conference table on May 23 wearing black pants with elegant white ruffles down the side that had fanned as she walked into the room. As her eyes panned reporters around the room, Beechem seemed nervous but firm.</p>

<p>For almost as long as she has been in office, Beechem, 38, has had an investigation looming.</p>

<p>On May 21, State Auditor Stacey Pickering issued demands for current and former town officials, including Beechem, to repay $500,000 because of misspent drug-forfeiture funds dating back to 2015.</p>

<p>"As the mayor, I will take accountability for signing checks because I did sign checks—I had to pay bills," she said. "[A]s the new mayor and, walking into this situation (for) a month and a half, I was under the impression that people abided by the law."</p>

<p>Beechem became Rankin County's first black mayor in July 2017. A couple of months into her tenure, she raised questions about checks that seemed off to her and reached out to the state auditor's office for clarity. The formal state investigation into the town began a month later, she said.</p>

<p>The state auditor says that Pelahatchie officials had been transferring drug-seizure funds to the town's utility account, the fire department and the town's regular checking account to prevent overdraft, and to pay salaries of people outside the police department. Those funds legally can only go toward law-enforcement uses.</p>

<p>"For years, the leadership of Pelahatchie abused these funds by attempting to use them to enhance the overall city budget when they were mandated to be allocated to the Pelahatchie Police Department," State Auditor Stacey Pickering said in a statement provided to the media.</p>

<p>Pickering issued two separate demands with some overlapping parties involved. The first is for $421,688.10 from January 2015 to June 2017 for which the following parties are jointly responsible: former Mayor Knox Ross, Jr.; former Alderman Jerry Norwood; former Alderwoman Megan Hall; former City Clerk Bettye Massey; current Alderman Frank Boyd; current Alderman Michael Adams; and current Alderwoman Margie Warren.</p>

<p>The second demand is for $80,694.97 from July 2017 to December 2017 after Beechem had become mayor. Former City Clerk Massey, Beechem and all five of the town's aldermen are jointly responsible for this second demand.</p>

<p>Beechem does not believe she should have to pay back the funds. Her lawyer, Thomas Bellinger, who sat next to her during the press conference last week, said he will pursue justice for his client.</p>

<p>The board of aldermen has not been open to the media, with all five aldermen either ignoring this reporter's past calls or hanging up at the mention of Beechem.</p>

<p>However, the group released a statement Tuesday entitled "The Mayor Who Cried Wolf," condemning Beechem and resurfacing accusations that she does not live in Pelahatchie, among other statements. Beechem said she dealt with these claims when she ran for mayor and submitted proof of residency. The Pelahatchie aldermen and former Mayor Ross are holding a press conference Wednesday.</p>

<p>The aldermen's statement says their own city auditor told them they could borrow drug-seizure money as long as they repaid it each year. The statement also says that Pickering's office did not interview the aldermen or the former mayor, and that borrowing the drug money is common. "Aldermen want to know why their town is being singled out by Pickering since many small towns across the state use drug seizure money to pay the bills and then repay those funds during the same calendar year," the statement says.</p>

<p>Around 1,300 people live in the small town 25 miles east of Jackson. However, the town drama and tension between the aldermen and mayor have made national news. At their Feb. 5 meeting, the board of aldermen voted to cut Beechem's salary by 75 percent and to halve their own salaries, citing budget cuts. The mayor and the board now make the same, $250 per month. The mayor wrote a veto a week later, laying out her vote of "no confidence" in the board and its financial dealings because of the ongoing state auditor's investigation of Pelahatchie for alleged misappropriation of funds.</p>

<p>The aldermen blame Pickering's investigation for the salary cuts, saying since drug-seizure funds could not be used, "aldermen say they had to find a way to raise the money to pay the bills."</p>

<p>Beechem has also had to step into some clerking duties, as three town clerks resigned in the first three months of 2018. Beechem said two walked out one afternoon in March while Beechem was out of the office. The other one was Massey, who is a named party in the state auditor's investigation and made at least $80,000 working for Pelahatchie.</p>

<p>On average, in cities around the same size as Pelahatchie with part-time mayors, the aldermen tend to make less than the mayor, a Mississippi State University survey shows. Some part-time mayors have salaries as much as 120 times more than Beechem's.</p>

<p>While aldermen earn more than part-time mayors in some towns in the state, they tend to be outliers.</p>

<p>The Pelahatchie Board of Aldermen is not the most transparent, with the board voting to not allow cellphones inside its public meetings earlier this year.</p>

<p>At the January board meeting a month before the salary cuts, Margie Warren recommended that the board should be able to bring up and vote on any items of their choosing, even ones not on the agenda.</p>

<p>The board sided with her unanimously, overriding Beechem's eventual veto. That's how an alderman was able to introduce a pay cut not listed on the agenda. Beechem said in April that the pay cut was "harsh" but not detrimental to her household. Beechem hopes to restore trust among the constituents in her hometown.</p>

<p>"At some point things have to stop, and you have to start doing things the right way. I'm glad that I am in this position because it could've been worse than it is now," the mayor told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<h2 id="lawyerssayjpdofficermayhavekilledtwicedemandsmorenames">Lawyers Say JPD Officer May Have Killed Twice, Demands More Names</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-22</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/22/lawyers-say-jpd-officer-may-have-killed-twice-dema/ </p>

<p>Baltimore attorney Jason Downs filed a civil-action petition against the City of Jackson demanding release of the names of officers involved in the shooting death of 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes in January 2018. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Attorneys for the family of Crystalline Barnes, killed by Jackson police on Jan. 27, 2018, are demanding to know the names of officers who shot Jacksonians in incidents over the last several months. They believe the same officer, whom they have identified as Rakasha Adams, may have shot and killed a man on Nov. 15, 2017, as well as Barnes earlier this year.</p>

<p>JPD, to date, has cited its long-time practice of not naming cops who fire on residents. They refuse to reveal names of officers involved in a growing number of officer-involved shootings in Jackson. The Jackson Free Press has not independently confirmed that Adams was involved in either shooting, but has also been denied the names of the officers.</p>

<p>Baltimore-based attorney Jason Downs of Downs Collins P.A. and Mississippi attorney Carlos Moore filed a petition on May 21 against the City of Jackson to retrieve the names of the two Jackson Police Department officers who were involved in the shooting of Crystalline Barnes, 21, in January, so that they can proceed with an excessive-force claim against JPD.</p>

<p>In a petition written on behalf of Crystalline Barnes' 2-year-old son, the attorneys urge the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi to grant a hearing in which someone from JPD would release the names in question.</p>

<p>This comes a week after a press conference outside City Hall where Downs said that his law firm would be taking legal action against the City of Jackson should they not release the names of the officers who allegedly shot and killed Barnes. Following an independent investigation, Downs identified one of the officers in the Barnes shooting as Adams, and his May 21 petition says she was likely also involved in the November death.</p>

<p>'Easily Angered' Officer? </p>

<p>Downs and Moore do not believe Adams received a proper mental evaluation after the November officer-involved shooting in which she allegedly shot an unidentified man in the chest when he brandished a knife.</p>

<p>"Upon information and belief, Jane Doe never received appropriate psychological screening or an adequate fitness for duty evaluation prior to resuming Jane Doe's duties as an officer for the JPD after the November 15 shooting," the court documents read. "Upon information and belief, Jane Doe is Officer Rakasha Adams."</p>

<p>JPD on the scene of officer involved shooting, Mayes St. near Lampton Ave. Unidentified black male subject shot. Officer not injured. No further to release at this time. Investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>— Jackson Police Dept. (@JacksonMSPolice) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>Per JPD protocol, any officer who uses deadly force has to attend stress counseling and a psychiatric/psychological evaluation, the results of which are sent to the police chief before he allows an officer to return to the line of duty. Under Interim Chief of Police Anthony Moore, who replaced Lee Vance early this year, this policy is slightly different. At a city council meeting on Feb. 27, Moore said officers now will not return until after a grand jury reaches a decision—a process that could take at least a year.</p>

<p>The officer also has to debrief with JPD's Employee Assistance Program counselor within 48 hours of the incident so that he or she can confidentially disclose any moral, ethical or psychological after-effects.</p>

<p>At the press conference on May 14, Downs stood by the Barnes family and Crystalline's two young children and told reporters that an independent investigation showed that Officer Adams had admitted in writing to having difficulty concentrating and that she is easily irritated and angered.</p>

<p>"We have an officer that admits to being easily angered walking the streets of Jackson armed with a gun," Downs said. "We believe that these factors play a role in Officer Adams' unjustified decision to shoot at Crystalline.</p>

<p>" Different Accounts of Barnes' Death </p>

<p>The court documents detail a slightly different account of what happened to Barnes than what JPD released in January. Downs and Moore say Officer Adams began following Barnes on Jan. 27 as Barnes drove through Jackson. Adams had apparently been on duty near the intersection of Fernwood Drive and Overstreet Avenue as was a male officer who has not yet been formally identified.</p>

<p>"In contrast to the actions of reasonable police officers, Officer Adams and John Doe exited their vehicles and purportedly attempted to initiate a traffic stop of Ms. Barnes," the court document reads. Both parties agree that Barnes was pulled over in a traffic stop.</p>

<p>However, Downs and Moore allege that Adams and the other male officer fired, collectively, around 18 shots through the side doors and back window of Barnes' car as she drove forward. No gunshots went through the front of her vehicle, but hit the young woman once in the back of the head and once in the back, the attorneys say. Barnes collided head-on and crashed into a pole after being shot.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said in January that the officer who made the stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said in a statement then.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," the statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect's vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Then Holmes said Barnes drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>Minimal Public Information Provided</p>

<p>The petition says Barnes' attorneys filed a public-records request on April 12, 2018, for any and all 911 calls, documents, footage including those from body cameras, police reports, and virtually any media or documentation involving the Barnes death. In return, JPD provided them a one-page incident report without including the name of either officer in the shooting.</p>

<p>Four days later, the attorneys filed another public-records request for the incident report related to the Nov. 15 shooting in which they accuse Adams of being involved. Again, they received a one-page incident report that did not name the officer involved in that shooting.</p>

<p>Barnes and Downs want the names of the officers in order to go through with an excessive force claim that includes "negligent supervision of Jane Doe for JPD's failure to properly provide psychological counseling and fitness for duty evaluations for Jane Doe." The attorneys wrote in the petition that a delay in the release of these names would be a delay in justice.</p>

<p>The Jackson Police Department currently has no policy in place for how it handles the identification of officers who shoot people, just a longstanding practice of never releasing the names or the status of the investigations. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigations stepped in to handle officer-involved shootings in the Jackson metro as of February.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba issued an executive order in March to develop a task force to create city policy on whether or not the City will release officers' names after an officer-involved shooting in Jackson. There have been eight such shootings since Lumumba took office in July 2017 with three lethal ones in 2018 alone.</p>

<p>The task force has met four times over eight weeks and has not reached conclusions to date.</p>

<h2 id="whatlumumbasateamearns">What Lumumba’s ‘A-Team’ Earns</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-23</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/23/what-lumumbas-team-earns/ </p>

<p>Examining the salaries of department heads in the City of Jackson under Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba and former Mayor Tony Yarber shows that Lumumba’s executive staff gets paid between 3.4 and 8 percent more than the previous mayor’s did—but the women don’t fare as well as the men. Photo by File Photo</p>

<p>JACKSON — As we get nearer to annual budget hearings in the City of Jackson, you can almost feel the tension mounting around money issues.</p>

<p>In April, the bickering came over the council's decision to raise the part-time city clerk's salary so that Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote could hire a new clerk. Other municipal workers protested.</p>

<p>During a discussion about the payroll at that same meeting, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, who did not support the pay raise for part-time city clerks, defensively aired out his frustrations with rumors he had heard about how much money people in his administration were making, including one claiming a 30-percent increase in the mayor's staffing budget.</p>

<p>Lumumba said everybody who came to work for him took less money than they were previously making, and that one person on his executive staff took $50,000 less, but he would not name that person.</p>

<p>An analysis of city salaries shows that Mayor Lumumba's "A-Team" makes between 3.4 and 8 percent more than Yarber's did. That group includes the chief administrative officer, the chief of staff, the communications manager, the public-works director, the director of planning and development, and the director of administration.</p>

<p>The variation depends on whether you count the time when Kishia Powell was public-works director from 2014-2016 paid at $150,000 a year compared to when Jerriot Smash took over the role when Powell went to Atlanta. He made $126,000.</p>

<p>Six people in the Lumumba administration are making six figures compared to four under Yarber. Of those, the mayor's salary ($119,999.36) and the chief of police's salary ($112,998.08) are the only positions with wages that are exactly the same across both administrations.</p>

<p>The Cost of the 'A-Team'</p>

<p>Last summer, Lumumba began announcing members of what he labels as his "A-Team." This group, hailing largely from academia, comes at a price, however.</p>

<p>Using data from the National League of Cities' average salaries of municipal officials, an "A-team" not including the mayor or the communications manager, costs around $450,000 collectively. The Lumumba "A-team" minus the communications manager and the mayor himself makes $511,000.</p>

<p>Nearly 2,000 cities and towns belong to the NLC, including 294 in the state.</p>

<p>Public Works Director Bob Miller is the highest-paid person in the City of Jackson with a salary of $125,991.84. However, Powell, Yarber's initial pick for the position, was paid almost 20 percent more than Miller. When Powell went to Atlanta to work for Mayor Kasim Reed, Smash filled in and remained until Miller took over the role in October 2017. Smash made $38 more than Miller makes now.</p>

<p>Robert Blaine, the city's chief administrative officer, is the second-highest paid member of the mayor's "A-team" (not including the mayor) making $111,537.92. His role involves making sure the City is operating efficiently. The various divisions in city government report to Blaine, with the exception of the chief of police, who reports directly to the mayor. Blaine was an unconventional choice for the role considering he has a background in music and working in administration at Jackson State University and Tougaloo College. The CAO under Yarber, originally Gus McCoy, made three-fourths of what Blaine makes.</p>

<p>Then comes Charles Hatcher with the Department of Finance and Administration who makes just over $105,000—an approximately 24-percent increase over the woman in that role under Yarber, Michelle Battee-Day. Hatcher, a Cornell University graduate with bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees in consumer economics from the Ivy League School, worked as a professor, then an independent consultant before coming to Jackson.</p>

<p>Mukesh Kumar, the director of planning and development, makes approximately $2,000 more than the last director, with a salary of $86,908.64. Kumar spent nearly 15 years as a professor of urban and regional planning at Jackson State University before joining the Lumumba administration.</p>

<p>Gender Math</p>

<p>The women of the Lumumba "A team" have either seen very little pay increase compared to their predecessors or are being paid less.</p>

<p>Looking at the women's salaries across both administrations, the only women to make six figures in both cabinets have been the city attorneys. Sharon Gipson, Lumumba's city attorney, makes $8 less than Monica Joiner, the city attorney under Yarber, with a salary of $106,238.08.</p>

<p>The mayor's chief of staff, Safiya Omari, makes $81,999.84—just a $2,000 net increase from the last woman in the role, Jacqueline Anderson-Woods.</p>

<p>Omari helps execute and advance the mayor's vision for the City and serves in his place when he is out of town, unavailable, or if a situation can be resolved without him. She also manages constituent services, the business community and communications.</p>

<p>Before coming to work for the City, Omari was the Associate Vice President for Research and Sponsored Programs.</p>

<p>Kai Williams, the city's communication manager, makes $51,617.28 a year which is 15-percent less than the woman in the role under Yarber, Sheila Byrd, who made $59,517.12.</p>

<p>The Pew Research Center found that in 2017, women in the United States working part-time and full-time earned 82 percent of what men earned.</p>

<p>CORRECTION: Safiya Omari's position at the time of departure from JSU was Associate Vice President for Research and Sponsored Programs. The changes are reflected above.</p>

<p>State Librarian Stephen Parks says he fell into his profession by accident. Parks, a La Grange, N.C., native, earned a bachelor's degree in political science from East Carolina University in 2006. Parks moved to Jackson for law school in 2007 and earned his law degree from Mississippi College School of Law in 2010.</p>

<p>"After three years in law school, I realized I didn't want to work as an attorney, but around the time of graduation, I saw they needed someone to work in the law library," he says. "I applied for that position not knowing what it would entail at the time, but I'm glad I took it, because now I love what I'm doing to make law accessible to the public."</p>

<p>In 2013, he received his master's degree in library and information science from the University of Southern Mississippi. He served as the research, instructional services and circulation librarian at MC's School of Law from 2010 to 2015, and taught legal research at the school. Parks also taught law librarianship at Tulane University in summer 2016 and has been an adjunct professor at the University of Southern Mississippi since 2015. He has served as Mississippi's state librarian since January 2016 and is responsible for overseeing the State Law Library inside the Gartin Justice Building in downtown Jackson. The library provides legal research materials for the judiciary branch, state agencies, lawyers, students and the general public.</p>

<p>"Since becoming state librarian I've been working hard to raise public awareness of the library, because many people don't realize it's available to the public," Parks says. "I want everyone to know they can visit us and use our resources."</p>

<p>In 2016 he established a partnership with the Mississippi Digital Library to provide some of the law library's historical items such as House and Senate journals online.</p>

<p>The American Association of Law Libraries, a national association of law school and court libraries, and independent librarians who perform law research, recently named Parks as a recipient of its 2018 Emerging Leader Award.</p>

<p>AALL gives the award to law librarians with less than 10 years of organization membership who have made significant contributions to the associations.</p>

<p>Parks, 33, is also chairman of the Central Mississippi Library Council, and previously served as vice president and Scholarship Committee chair of the organization. He is a member of the Mississippi Bar, the American Association of Law Libraries and the Southeastern Chapter of AALL.</p>

<p>Whether or not some people realize it, Jackson has many things to do, including events such as Midfest 2018. Photo by Amber Helsel.</p>

<p>Amber Helsel</p>

<p>Around 5 p.m. on May 17, most of the trucks had already lined up for Dinner and a Movie: A Food Truck Festival. Most Third Thursday events tend to be pretty quiet around the start time, but people had already started wandering for that festival.</p>

<p>About 17 food trucks showed up for the event, including LurnyD's Grille, 2 for 7 Kitchen, Chunky Dunks Sweets Truck and BessiRoo's, so people had a variety of food to choose from, not to mention other vendors that sold popcorn and painted faces.</p>

<p>Even with the forecast of rain, people showed up and piled on the lawn of the Art Garden, lying on blankets and sitting on chairs while listening to Pam Confer perform. Kids played in the fountains and made art with sidewalk chalk in the outdoor Art Lab. Around 8 p.m., Pixar classic "Wall-E" began playing. Of course, it was within the first five minutes that the rain rolled in. But rain aside, it was a good event.</p>

<p>Then, on Saturday, May 22, vendors started rolling into midtown around 2 p.m. to get ready for Midfest. In the 90-plus-degree heat, we popped up tents and unfolded tables. We hung art and placed our wares on tables.</p>

<p>Around 3 p.m., people began slowly trickling in. By the time the Southern Komfort Brass Band began their march, Wesley Avenue had a decent crowd. When the event ended, Offbeat had an after-party that I considered attending but decided not to because I was tired, sweaty and dirty.</p>

<p>As you can see, while it's easy to say that there's nothing to do in Jackson, that's not true. That was three events in four days, and I know from looking at jfpevents.com that there were plenty more in Jackson and the surrounding counties.</p>

<p>A lot of people tend to want to put Jackson in a negative light.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to do here," multiple people have said to me.</p>

<p>Sure, if you come from a bigger city, there may be less to do here, but you have many options, even if it's just going to the Mississippi Farmers Market on a Saturday morning.</p>

<p>It's so easy to be negative, especially about Jackson. The city isn't perfect. Miscommunications and infrastructure problems resulted in the death of Frances Anne Fortner, a student who was getting ready to graduate from Jackson Academy and attend journalism school. A cycle of violence resulted in the death of rising hip-hop star Lil Lonnie. We also have to deal with water problems, urban blight, under-funded education, and the list goes on.</p>

<p>I'm a bit of a hoarder when it comes to T-shirts. I have a drawer full of them, and then a second full of ones I wear when I paint. My two favorite T-shirts are from Studio Chane. One is the City of Jackson seal with some of the neighborhoods written on it. The other one is the City's seal with "City of Potholes" in the surrounding circles. They allow me to poke fun at Jackson while also repping it—in a good way.</p>

<p>That's the same reason I love my small collection of CityPins. Those items are fun and funny and insightful. They tell the story of Jackson—both the good and the bad.</p>

<p>We need real solutions to all of our problems. We need to talk about what the City should look like, about what do about the cycle of violence and crumbling infrastructure and the outside perception of Jackson.</p>

<p>Yes, actions speak louder than words, but sometimes it's important to talk and plan, then do. Not the other way around. You probably get mad when someone keys your car and then talks to you about the problem, instead of talking first and maybe even avoiding keying altogether.</p>

<p>At my church, we talk a lot about the importance of community, how we shouldn't have to be alone when we're dealing with problems, even if we feel alone. Humans are meant to be in community with each other. That's why there are cases where people have problems socially and developmentally when they don't have social interaction. That's why we're born into families and gather circles of friends. That's why kids who don't make positive friends have such a hard time with life.</p>

<p>We need that sense of community, and we need that dialogue. We need to come across all lines—racial, economic, religious, etc.—and find a good solution to what ails us. One person doesn't have to shoulder the world or even Jackson. None of us are Atlas, and I bet you anything that he got tired of carrying that burden sometimes.</p>

<p>Does a T-shirt with "Jackson get your sh*t together" shed a positive light on Jackson, or create productive dialogue ? Does it help uplift the city's narrative? Does DIY pothole patching create a long-term solution? Nope. Sure, it's a quick solution to a problem, and it's meant to be a quick solution. We get that. But at this point, we don't need quick solutions.</p>

<p>We need more than just a T-shirt with a cuss word and temporary patches, and the resulting divisiveness.</p>

<p>And that outside perception? Guess what? We can't change people's minds ourselves. We can't force people in Madison and Rankin counties to believe that Jackson isn't a bad place (even though we all know it's true). We have to show them what it has to offer, and then they can decide what to believe.</p>

<p>My sister and I have had semi-regular lunch meetings lately, and I always insist that we eat in Jackson. It's partially because I want to stay close to work and spend optimal time with her, but it's also because she hasn't really seen the city.</p>

<p>She lives in Rankin County, and like a lot of people, she bought into this lie that Jackson is a bad place. But slowly, I think she's starting to see it for what it is: an incredible city (with some deep-rooted issues, to be sure) that has a lot to offer. Now we just need to believe that ourselves.</p>

<p>It is officially music festival season. If you find yourself going to one this year, you'll want to be prepared. Here are some tips to survive the event and have fun.</p>

<p>Look at the festival rules. It is important to know what you can and cannot take into a venue, and the more you know, the quicker you'll get through the lines.</p>

<p>Get a ticket beforehand. You may be able to buy tickets on site, but they typically will sell out quickly.</p>

<p>Get a bag that can carry everything. And I mean everything and extras, like T-shirts or freebies. You won't want to carry a water bottle or your phone around the entire time.</p>

<p>If you have prescription or expensive glasses or sunglasses, put them in a case when you take them off. They're less likely to get damaged and harder to lose.</p>

<p>Find a good sunscreen, and reapply it every few hours. Even if it is a cloudy day, UV rays can still damage your skin. Also, make sure to bring BAND-AIDs—accidents happen, especially in crowds.</p>

<p>Get a portable battery pack for your phone. This will come in handy when you've been at a festival for the better part of a day, and your phone is dying while your favorite band plays. Some festivals may also have charging stations, so keep an eye out for those.</p>

<p>Don't eat a lot before the festival. Trust me. You will regret it. Sweaty and stuffed are not a fun combination.</p>

<p>Conserve your energy beforehand. You may be at the festival for seven-plus hours, so you want to be as rested as possible by the time you get to the event.</p>

<p>Bring snacks, such as protein bars or small packets of peanut butter. If the venue allows outside food, this can save you quite a few dollars. More money for merch!</p>

<p>Bring a poncho. Almost every music festival gets rained on at some point, so you want to be prepared. And it can double as something to lay on the ground.</p>

<p>Wear comfortable clothes and shoes. Sure, it's nice to look cute, but you should probably also wear something that you don't mind getting dirty. Take a look at the weather forecast, too, as rain boots may be a good idea.</p>

<h2 id="opiniontheholylandisraeliorpalestinian">OPINION: The Holy Land, Israeli or Palestinian?</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Avery Rollins</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-23</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/23/opinion-holy-land-israeli-or-palestinian/ </p>

<p>I've come to the conclusion that the Palestinians have been given a raw deal and are being treated unfairly by Israel, by the American media and particularly now by the White House. Photo by Max Pixel</p>

<p>Avery Rollins</p>

<p>In 1966 I was one of four FBI Agents assigned to a yearlong Arabic language/Iraqi dialect course at the Army Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif. In that 12-month course, I was introduced to Muslim history, culture and politics, and made many Muslim friends, including Iraqis, Egyptians, Kurds and Palestinians.</p>

<p>When the six-day Arab/Israeli war broke out in June 1967, our formal instruction ceased, and we spent the week listening to radio broadcasts from the BBC, Radio Cairo and Radio Tel Aviv. We also heard many personal stories from Palestinians about the "Nakba," the catastrophe which occurred in 1948 when the establishment of the State of Israel resulted in the expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians from their homes and villages, making them refugees.</p>

<p>In the subsequent 30 years of my FBI career, I worked Middle East espionage and terrorism cases in New York City, Washington, D. C., and Oxford, Miss. I visited Israel, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and Gaza. Since that time I've come to the conclusion that the Palestinians have been given a raw deal and are being treated unfairly by Israel, by the American media and particularly now by the White House.</p>

<p>With the land seizures in 1948, and the seizure of Gaza and the West Bank in 1967, Israel gained control over a Palestinian population that is now approaching five million. Palestinians have little political or monetary control over their lives and chaff under illegal Israeli rule.</p>

<p>Another 1.5 million of them live in refugee camps in Lebanon and Jordan.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that in the current Israeli/Palestinian conflict, most American media favor the State of Israel over the aspirations of Palestinians who wish to establish their own country. The truth is Palestinians have an even greater right to The Holy Land than do the Israelis. The British Mandate governed Palestine from 1922 to 1948. During that time the resident population was about 700,000: 80 percent Palestinian; 10 percent Jew; 10 percent Christian. The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 resulted in a huge influx of Jewish refugees and illegal land grabs from Palestinians, which continue today in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Orthodox Israelis and others claim the Holy Land is theirs based on biblical history and tradition. DNA studies show that Israelis and Palestinians spring from the same Canaanite ancestors. More than likely, Canaanite tribes in the Holy Land split into two separate groups: Jews and Palestinians.</p>

<p>The truth is that the most famous stories in the Old Testament Bible, like the Exodus and King David, are a collection of oral histories and myths rather than actual historical facts.</p>

<p>These are wonderful allegories that I enjoy reading. But they should not be used as a basis to illegally seize property, land and freedom from the Palestinians.</p>

<p>What I am suggesting is that those who rely on the Bible as justifying the State of Israel are relying on myths and stories that have no historical, legal or archeological basis. It is time to give the Palestinians back their country; return Israel to the original 1947 UN Partition Plan of Palestine; and allow Palestinians to return to their homeland.</p>

<p>If Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba is to be a radical changemaker, he and those under him must be proactive so that, at the very least, no one else dies while traversing the streets in Mississippi's capital city due to negligence. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Now that a promising young woman has died because of a massive systems failure in the City, allow us to repeat ourselves: This administration cannot afford to be reactionary to the mounting issues in the City. If Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba is to be a radical changemaker, he and those under him must be proactive so that, at the very least, no one else dies while traversing the streets in Mississippi's capital city due to negligence.</p>

<p>Before Frances Fortner, 18, died due to an ignored manhole, Jacksonian Jean Holmes reported the loose manhole cover to a police officer after she had two flat tires earlier that day. An officer deemed the manhole fine, and the City did not care enough to secure the deadly site.</p>

<p>Superior Asphalt, a contractor, is continuing its work after raising the manhole covers at the site of Fortner's fatal accident two weeks ago.</p>

<p>Whether due to low morale in public works or the administration in general, a bad contracting job or overwhelm in the police department, there is no excuse for Fortner's death. We appreciate that Lumumba admitted publicly that no one in the City took the hazard seriously enough to urgently check and repair it. But owning this tragic catastrophe is the least he and his well-paid chief administrative officer could do. What is required is a total systems check and overhaul with transparency, accountability and staff management and motivation instilled at every City position; staffers who don't get on board must be replaced.</p>

<p>This is difficult, but it is what every effective organization must do—especially those taxpayers fund. And it is what both Lumumba and CAO Robert Blaine must require and do. Far too many things happen last minute or too late on their watch—from midnight press alerts of meetings 12 hours later to Friday-night tax increases.</p>

<p>We do not yet see the urgency this tragedy should ignite in the Lumumba administration to immediately institute smart, strict systems that could have kept Fortner alive. At a May 21 press conference, after the mayor said he and Public Works Director Bob Miller are working to come up with better protocols, Lumumba suggested that citizens call both 911 and 311 when they encounter dangerous potholes or uncovered manholes.</p>

<p>There must be a better solution than calling 911 for someone to bring out an orange cone, especially after 40 homicides this year alone—or than calling two places hoping one might respond. The public needs to see a sense of immediacy about who is responsible for taking the call, assigning an immediate response, tracking it, checking it and alerting the public. We want printed policies and checklists showing who is accountable at every stage, which every City department needs to develop for every responsibility we pay its workers to do. Lumumba and Blaine must instill systems today.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi county election commissions will be able to apply to the secretary of state's office for federal grant funds to secure elections this year. Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann announced that Mississippi will receive $4.5 million in federal Help America Vote Act funds, likely this summer. Hosemann put up a 5-percent match, about $224,000, from his state budget so the state can receive the funding.</p>

<p>He told the Jackson Free Press that some of the funds will go toward making the Statewide Election Management System stronger, but the majority of the money will go to the counties that apply. They can use the funds to upgrade voting machines, or if they do not need those upgrades—like in Hinds County—they can apply for funds to use on election security and disability access.</p>

<p>"We're encouraging them to make sure we have disability access to the polls," Hosemann said.</p>

<p>Counties will not receive the funds before the congressional primary election on June 5 but could have them before the general election in November.</p>

<p>Hosemann's office has worked with the Mississippi National Guard and the Department of Homeland Security to ensure that the state's election system is secure. Mississippi's voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and some counties use paper ballots. In order to test security, Hosemann has hired outside groups to attempt to penetrate the statewide election system, but no such attempts have prevailed, he said.</p>

<p>"The cyber-security risk is not that they will get your ballot; it's that they will influence your decision," Hosemann told the Jackson Free Press. "If you look at these companies that have been charged by the president for participating in our election process, they're all doing it by Facebook and email, and those kinds of things."</p>

<p>He pointed to social-media accounts Russian groups used to influence public opinion during the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>"One of the (usernames) was 'Tenn_gop.' Now, you and I would think, 'Well, that's the Tennessee GOP.' Well, it's not; it's the Russians," Hosemann said. "They tried to get us to where we are so distrustful of the system that we don't cast a ballot. That's the biggest risk."</p>

<p>Mississippians will go to the polls on June 5 to vote in Democratic or Republican primary elections, which are open. All four Congressional House seats are up for re-election, as well as both Senate seats after Sen. Thad Cochran retired this spring.</p>

<p>JACKSON — At a press conference on Tuesday, May 22, Mayor Chowke Antar Lumumba announced programs to try to help decrease youth crime, including summer programs and new policing methods.</p>

<p>"We truly are excited about engaging our youth," Lumumba said. "Let me be clear that we do not believe nor are we saying that our issues of crime are ... (only) on account of young people. But we have seen a recent spree of instances that have been engaged by a particularly young demographic, and we have failed in some regard as adults if our young people are not directing positivity, so we're going to make the decision that we're not going to allow them to be on that path anymore."</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department officers will receive training in community policing, but Lumumba declined to name the group that will train them, saying the City will release the information at a later date.</p>

<p>"How we direct this training will take advantage of lessons learned around the country and the nation, but it will be specifically tailored to the unique culture of Jackson," the mayor said.</p>

<p>Officers will also receive violence interruption training. The City will also start credible messenger training, which prepares former criminals to help young people stay out of legal troubles, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>"This is the type of training that utilizes the experiences of individuals that have found themselves on the wrong side of the law, who have found themselves historically having gone down a path that is less desirable but yet still have the ear of our young people," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>For more information, call the Department of Parks and Recreation at 601-960-0471.</p>

<p>Youth Programs</p>

<p>Lumumba also said he will request that the City Council use extra money in the budget to fund youth programs.</p>

<p>"Instead of spending as much time telling young people what not to do, we need to make certain that we are giving our efforts towards telling them what to do," he said.</p>

<p>A summer employment program will aim to teach people ages 16 to 24 work ethic and skills. Part of the program includes a partnership with Apple to teach participants application coding through a curriculum called Swift Playgrounds.</p>

<p>"This is a gamified learning curriculum where students will actually learn how to code for app development," Robert Blaine, Jackson's chief administrative officer, said at the press conference.</p>

<p>Youth will work with corporate partners to develop small apps for the companies, he said.</p>

<p>"We've taken a lot of applicants already for the summer employment program, so that's basically going to take a few more for the coding part. For the most part, those applications have already been taken," Director of Human and Cultural Services Adriane Dorsey-Kidd told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>However, she said that if there is a lot of interest in the program, it could expand.</p>

<p>Those interested in applying should call 601-960-0335 and ask for Family and Youth Coordinator Eva Howard.</p>

<p>Registration for the summer program for children ages 6 to 12 ends Friday. To register, visit the Department of Parks and Recreation at the Metrocenter Mall, and bring the child's birth certificate or shot record and a money order for $110.</p>

<p>There is also an early childhood program for children ages 5 and under. Parents can register their kids for the year-round program by calling Manager Jewell Reed at 601-960-0035. The program has a sliding fee scale so families pay anywhere from $10 a week to $10 a month based on need.</p>

<p>"I would also like to solicit the support of any philanthropic donors, any of our corporations, any of our partners in this city, that they be willing to give donations toward youth programs," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>Swimming Pools</p>

<p>At the press conference, Parks and Recreation Director Ison B. Harris Jr. said that the City will open five pools on Memorial Day, with an additional pool in Presidential Hills to open the week after the holiday.</p>

<p>The pools are Grove Park Pool, McDowell Pool, VA/Legion Pool, Vine Street Pool and Russell C. Davis Pool, also known as Mary C. Jones Pool. In August, two splash pads will break ground in the city.</p>

<p>"We're excited about those opportunities," Harris said. "We're really excited about what's going on in Parks and Rec. We're really excited about what's going on in the city, and we're looking to engage our young people through their challenging times this summer."</p>

<p>Oscar-winning actor Morgan Freeman apologized on Thursday to anyone who may have felt "uncomfortable or disrespected" by his behavior, after CNN reported that multiple women have accused the A-list actor of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior on movie sets and in other professional settings.</p>

<p>"Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy," the actor, now 80, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press by his publicist, Stan Rosenfield. "I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected — that was never my intent."</p>

<p>Freeman won the 2005 Oscar for best supporting actor for "Million Dollar Baby." He was nominated four other times, including for "Driving Miss Daisy" and "The Shawshank Redemption," and is renowned for his prolific voiceover work.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, he was honored by SAG-AFTRA with a lifetime achievement award. In a statement to The Associated Press, the organization, which represents actors, journalists and others, called the allegations "compelling and devastating" and contrary to its attempts to make sure working environments are safe in the industry.</p>

<p>"Any accused person has the right to due process, but it is our starting point to believe the courageous voices who come forward to report incidents of harassment," the statement read. "Given Mr. Freeman recently received one of our union's most prestigious honors recognizing his body of work, we are therefore reviewing what corrective actions may be warranted at this time."</p>

<p>The CNN report includes the account of a production assistant on the 2017 heist film "Going In Style," who detailed an incident in which the actor repeatedly tried to lift up her skirt, and asked if she was wearing underwear. She alleged that Freeman subjected her to unwanted touching and comments on a near-daily basis on the film.</p>

<p>Several women alleged that he made frequent comments about their bodies, or would stare at them in ways that made them feel uncomfortable. CNN spoke to 16 people about Freeman; eight said they had experienced harassment or inappropriate behavior, and eight said they had witnessed such conduct. Seven of them described harassment or inappropriate behavior at Revelations Entertainment, a company he co-founded with Lori McCreary.</p>

<p>The CNN report also cited accounts by three entertainment reporters of inappropriate remarks they allege Freeman made at press junkets, including the report's co-author, Chloe Melas, who describes Freeman shaking her hand, "not letting go while repeatedly looking her up and down and saying more than once a variation of, 'I wish I was there'" — and also "You are ripe."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — An effort to turn the home of a slain civil rights leader into a national monument is gaining more bipartisan support.</p>

<p>Republican U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi and Democratic Sen. Doug Jones of Alabama introduced a bill Monday to make the Medgar Evers home a monument.</p>

<p>The U.S. House passed a bill last week to do the same thing. The two chambers must agree on a single bill before it could go to the president.</p>

<p>As Mississippi's first NAACP field secretary beginning in 1954, Evers organized protests and boycotts to fight segregation. He was assassinated by a white supremacist outside his family's Jackson home in 1963.</p>

<p>Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has recommended national monument status for the Evers home, which is now owned by Tougaloo College.</p>

<h2 id="lawyerssayjpdofficermayhavekilledtwicedemandsmorenames-1">Lawyers Say JPD Officer May Have Killed Twice, Demands More Names</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/22/lawyers-say-jpd-officer-may-have-killed-twice-dema/ </p>

<p>Baltimore attorney Jason Downs filed a civil-action petition against the City of Jackson demanding release of the names of officers involved in the shooting death of 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes in January 2018. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Attorneys for the family of Crystalline Barnes, killed by Jackson police on Jan. 27, 2018, are demanding to know the names of officers who shot Jacksonians in incidents over the last several months. They believe the same officer, whom they have identified as Rakasha Adams, may have shot and killed a man on Nov. 15, 2017, as well as Barnes earlier this year.</p>

<p>JPD, to date, has cited its long-time practice of not naming cops who fire on residents. They refuse to reveal names of officers involved in a growing number of officer-involved shootings in Jackson. The Jackson Free Press has not independently confirmed that Adams was involved in either shooting, but has also been denied the names of the officers.</p>

<p>Baltimore-based attorney Jason Downs of Downs Collins P.A. and Mississippi attorney Carlos Moore filed a petition on May 21 against the City of Jackson to retrieve the names of the two Jackson Police Department officers who were involved in the shooting of Crystalline Barnes, 21, in January, so that they can proceed with an excessive-force claim against JPD.</p>

<p>In a petition written on behalf of Crystalline Barnes' 2-year-old son, the attorneys urge the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi to grant a hearing in which someone from JPD would release the names in question.</p>

<p>This comes a week after a press conference outside City Hall where Downs said that his law firm would be taking legal action against the City of Jackson should they not release the names of the officers who allegedly shot and killed Barnes. Following an independent investigation, Downs identified one of the officers in the Barnes shooting as Adams, and his May 21 petition says she was likely also involved in the November death.</p>

<p>'Easily Angered' Officer? </p>

<p>Downs and Moore do not believe Adams received a proper mental evaluation after the November officer-involved shooting in which she allegedly shot an unidentified man in the chest when he brandished a knife.</p>

<p>"Upon information and belief, Jane Doe never received appropriate psychological screening or an adequate fitness for duty evaluation prior to resuming Jane Doe's duties as an officer for the JPD after the November 15 shooting," the court documents read. "Upon information and belief, Jane Doe is Officer Rakasha Adams."</p>

<p>JPD on the scene of officer involved shooting, Mayes St. near Lampton Ave. Unidentified black male subject shot. Officer not injured. No further to release at this time. Investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>— Jackson Police Dept. (@JacksonMSPolice) November 15, 2017</p>

<p>Per JPD protocol, any officer who uses deadly force has to attend stress counseling and a psychiatric/psychological evaluation, the results of which are sent to the police chief before he allows an officer to return to the line of duty. Under Interim Chief of Police Anthony Moore, who replaced Lee Vance early this year, this policy is slightly different. At a city council meeting on Feb. 27, Moore said officers now will not return until after a grand jury reaches a decision—a process that could take at least a year.</p>

<p>The officer also has to debrief with JPD's Employee Assistance Program counselor within 48 hours of the incident so that he or she can confidentially disclose any moral, ethical or psychological after-effects.</p>

<p>At the press conference on May 14, Downs stood by the Barnes family and Crystalline's two young children and told reporters that an independent investigation showed that Officer Adams had admitted in writing to having difficulty concentrating and that she is easily irritated and angered.</p>

<p>"We have an officer that admits to being easily angered walking the streets of Jackson armed with a gun," Downs said. "We believe that these factors play a role in Officer Adams' unjustified decision to shoot at Crystalline.</p>

<p>" Different Accounts of Barnes' Death </p>

<p>The court documents detail a slightly different account of what happened to Barnes than what JPD released in January. Downs and Moore say Officer Adams began following Barnes on Jan. 27 as Barnes drove through Jackson. Adams had apparently been on duty near the intersection of Fernwood Drive and Overstreet Avenue as was a male officer who has not yet been formally identified.</p>

<p>"In contrast to the actions of reasonable police officers, Officer Adams and John Doe exited their vehicles and purportedly attempted to initiate a traffic stop of Ms. Barnes," the court document reads. Both parties agree that Barnes was pulled over in a traffic stop.</p>

<p>However, Downs and Moore allege that Adams and the other male officer fired, collectively, around 18 shots through the side doors and back window of Barnes' car as she drove forward. No gunshots went through the front of her vehicle, but hit the young woman once in the back of the head and once in the back, the attorneys say. Barnes collided head-on and crashed into a pole after being shot.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said in January that the officer who made the stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said in a statement then.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," the statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect's vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Then Holmes said Barnes drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>Minimal Public Information Provided</p>

<p>The petition says Barnes' attorneys filed a public-records request on April 12, 2018, for any and all 911 calls, documents, footage including those from body cameras, police reports, and virtually any media or documentation involving the Barnes death. In return, JPD provided them a one-page incident report without including the name of either officer in the shooting.</p>

<p>Four days later, the attorneys filed another public-records request for the incident report related to the Nov. 15 shooting in which they accuse Adams of being involved. Again, they received a one-page incident report that did not name the officer involved in that shooting.</p>

<p>Barnes and Downs want the names of the officers in order to go through with an excessive force claim that includes "negligent supervision of Jane Doe for JPD's failure to properly provide psychological counseling and fitness for duty evaluations for Jane Doe." The attorneys wrote in the petition that a delay in the release of these names would be a delay in justice.</p>

<p>The Jackson Police Department currently has no policy in place for how it handles the identification of officers who shoot people, just a longstanding practice of never releasing the names or the status of the investigations. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigations stepped in to handle officer-involved shootings in the Jackson metro as of February.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba issued an executive order in March to develop a task force to create city policy on whether or not the City will release officers' names after an officer-involved shooting in Jackson. There have been eight such shootings since Lumumba took office in July 2017 with three lethal ones in 2018 alone.</p>

<p>The task force has met four times over eight weeks and has not reached conclusions to date.</p>

<h2 id="lumumbacitesfailuresthatledtodeathoffrancesfortner">Lumumba Cites 'Failures' That Led to Death of Frances Fortner</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Marie Weidmayer</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-22</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba held a press conference on May 21, where he acknowledged the City of Jackson failed to respond appropriately to a road hazard which caused a fatal crash on May 17. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>On behalf of the City of Jackson, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has accepted responsibility for not preventing the accident that killed Frances "Franny" Fortner.</p>

<p>"I feel that it is my responsibility as mayor of this city to be honest to the Fortner family and to be honest to the citizens of Jackson and acknowledge that the City of Jackson failed to appropriately secure the site at the time that we learned that the manhole cover was not properly in place," Lumumba said at a press briefing Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>"We owe responsibility to the Fortner family, and we owe that acknowledgement and taking responsibility to the citizens of Jackson. I offer my sincerest condolences."</p>

<p>The investigation into the crash that killed a recent Jackson Academy graduate is ongoing, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>The crash occurred around noon on May 17 on Ridgewood Road near Venetian Way, when Fortner hit a manhole and her vehicle flipped as she drove to graduation practice in her mother's convertible.</p>

<p>Prior to Fortner's crash, Jackson resident Jean Holmes reported a loose manhole cover to a Jackson police officer after she had two flat tires around 9 a.m. The City of Jackson did not secure the crash site appropriately after the report of flat tires, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>Construction on Ridgewood Road has been ongoing since June 2017. Superior Asphalt paved the interior lanes in June and July. The company then left the jobsite and returned to pave the exterior lanes in October and November. In February, Superior Asphalt paved the intersections, Director of Public Works Bob Miller said at the press conference.</p>

<p>Then two weeks ago, Superior Asphalt returned to raise the manhole covers to road level and finish miscellaneous tasks, Miller said.</p>

<p>"We would have much preferred for those manholes to be raised at the time of the paving or shortly thereafter, and there is some dissatisfaction on our part that it took as long as it did. But we do not believe that there were open manholes with no barricades around it until the day of the tragic accident," Miller said.</p>

<p>Manhole covers weigh between 100 and 150 pounds and are not secured because of their weight, the mayor said Monday, with Superior spokesman Kenny Bush confirming that by phone. Superior Asphalt places the covers and then adds pavement around the covers to ensure the surface is level, Bush said.</p>

<p>"It was covered Friday, a week before the accident," Bush said. "We were finished with that manhole and those around it on that particular part of Ridgewood the week before. They had been driven over for five or six days with no issues."</p>

<p>It is believed the manhole cover failed in the fatal crash, but more details will not be available until the investigations are complete, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>"What we have here are two failures," Lumumba said. "We have—and there is still an investigation into one of those failures, well, there is an investigation for all of them—one failure infrastructure. All we know now is Superior is the contractor who was dealing with the project."</p>

<p>Lumumba said he reviewed the calls the City received about the manhole on May 17. The City received calls about the manhole cover after Holmes' incident around 9 a.m. and after the fatal crash.</p>

<p>"But let me be clear the citizens did what they were supposed to do in the circumstance," Lumumba said. "There's evidence that the citizens called as they should have called."</p>

<p>After Holmes popped two tires, a police officer responded to secure the car and check the manhole cover. The officer conducted a visual inspection of the cover and believed it to be in place, but officers do not have infrastructure training, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>"People were dispatched but we—even in people being dispatched—we did not appropriately secure the site," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>The Department of Public Works does not do first response for incidents, which means no one from the department was dispatched immediately to the site. The city is looking into how it responds to reports of road hazards to establish better protocols, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>For now, Lumumba advised citizens to call both 911 and 311 to report road hazards, Lumumba said.</p>

<p>It is hard to choose which site of civil-rights trauma in Mississippi should be a national park, but the effort is under way and controversial, even among some family members who lost loved ones due to white-supremacist violence.</p>

<p>Last week, a group from the National Parks Service traversed the state to host listening sessions to determine where a new national park with civil-rights significance would go. Last May, Congress passed a law requiring the U.S. secretary of the interior to study at least five locales in Mississippi significant to the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

<p>Congress included the Medgar and Myrlie Evers House in Jackson where Medgar was assassinated in 1963; Bryant's Grocery &amp; Meat Market where 14-year-old Emmett Till allegedly whistled at Carolyn Bryant in 1955—a fabricated act for which he was later murdered; the Tallahatchie County Courthouse where the men accused of murdering Till were tried and acquitted; the Old Neshoba County Jail where three Freedom Summer civil rights workers James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were kept before police and the Ku Klux Klan murdered them in June 1964; and Dr. Gilbert Mason's former medical office in Biloxi on the Coast, where he helped organize "wade-ins" from 1959-1963 to desegregate the beaches.</p>

<p>But not everyone liked the suggestions. Impassioned community members showed up at the public forums, some advocating for other sites to be included and others lamenting the initial five sites.</p>

<p>Till Family 'Not Pleased'</p>

<p>Priscilla Sterling, a relative of Till, was one of them. She stood up in front of approximately three dozen people in a "Emmett Till Family for Justice" T-shirt at the Medgar Evers library in Jackson on May 8 to discourage the NPS representatives from considering the Bryant Store and the Tallahatchie Courthouse. She had also gone to the listening session at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum that morning.</p>

<p>"As a family member of Emmett Till, the sites that you all suggested you know we did not like," Sterling said. "The perpetrators owned the store, and (Carolyn Bryant) lied, and that just shouldn't be a national landmark. The courthouse is out because (Till) never received justice; these men were able to get off and go out and sell the story. So the family is not pleased with these two locations."</p>

<p>Instead, Sterling asked NPS representatives to add the home of Moses Wright, Till's great uncle, where the boy stayed during his brief time in the state and where the white men kidnapped him.</p>

<p>"We never received justice, the State of Mississippi never apologized to the family, so we do not see the courthouse or the grocery story as a national landmark—they should not use it, period," she said.</p>

<p>Sterling does not believe that Till has been honored adequately. She pointed to rising hate in the nation during the same time period when Carolyn Bryant's confession to lying about her interaction with Till in 1955 surfaced in Timothy Tyson's 2017 book "The Blood of Emmett Till." In the book, she tells Tyson that her trial testimony that Till had grabbed her around the waist and uttered obscenities was not true. Sterling believes true justice would mean bringing Bryant to trial. For now, she said it was good the parks people seemed open to considering other places.</p>

<p>Alferdteen Harrison, a retired Jackson State University professor and chairwoman of Scott Ford Houses Inc., also has concerns about this National Parks study. She leads an effort to restore the two houses that once belonged to a midwife and her daughter in the Farish Street Historic District as timepieces demonstrating African American life between slavery and the Civil Rights Movement. If she secures the funding, she hopes to turn the homes into interpretive museums that highlight how African Americans lived after slavery.</p>

<p>"Is it all about people getting killed or people stepping out ... or is it how did people live from this period from the end of slavery to the Civil Rights Movement?" she asked the NPS parks representatives when they opened the floor up for a question and answer session. "My basic concern is ... what about how African Americans lived in this interim, what we called the stepping stone. How do you get to the Civil Rights Movement?"</p>

<p>To meet the criteria of a feasible National Parks site, an area has to contain nationally significant or cultural resources, represent a cultural resource that is not yet represented in an existing national park, present a need for NPS management, and the parks service has to be able to acquire and maintain the property for a reasonable cost. If a site meets all of the criteria, Congress would decide to enact legislation to establish a new park or the president himself would make that call.</p>

<p>'Mississippi Burning'</p>

<p>At the meeting in Philadelphia, Miss., about 70 miles to the east of Jackson, Ben West of the NPS told the crowd of about 45 on May 9 that he was not quite sure how Congress chose the sites they listed in the 2017 legislation mandating the study.</p>

<p>"We've gotten a lot of questions and concerns about how those sites were presented to us, and honestly, my answer is that those are the first five that we started with, but we've certainly heard of a lot more over the last several days to understand the ones that perhaps weren't in that list," West said.</p>

<p>He assured the room that those five sites were not chiseled in stone and that they had come to Philadelphia to learn more about the deep history there.</p>

<p>Philadelphia is notorious for what the FBI dubbed the "Mississippi Burning" murders in 1964. As part of the Freedom Summer efforts to help black Mississippians register to vote, Mt. Zion United Methodist Church in the black community of Longdale had been identified as a site for those efforts. One evening in June 1964, the Ku Klux Klan met church members leaving Mt. Zion, beat members and burned the church to the ground.</p>

<p>On June 21, 1964, the three civil rights workers, Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner, went down that woodsy, winding road leading to the church to investigate the burning. On their way back to the COFO offices in Meridian, Neshoba County Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price pulled them over for speeding and took them to what is now the Old Neshoba County Jail—a site Congress listed to be included in the civil rights study.</p>

<p>The three men were released that evening. With a lynch mob in tow, Price followed the men as they rolled down the dark Highway 19 South. Price stopped them, and he and at least a half-dozen other white men shot them on a dirt road off Highway 19 and then transported them to be buried under an earthen dam on the western side of the county. Their bodies were not found for 44 days. Several of the men, including Price, were prosecuted in federal court for violating the three men's civil rights and served several years in prison, but the State of Mississippi would not bring charges then.</p>

<p>Decades later, in 2005, the State of Mississippi tried and convicted mob organizer Edgar Ray Killen of manslaughter for orchestrating the murders.</p>

<p>Jewel McDonald, a member of Mt. Zion who meets tourists who come to the church from all over the world, said most people want to just spend time on the grounds, walk through the cemetery where black civil-rights heroes are buried or pray on what some refer to as holy ground.</p>

<p>McDonald's mother and brother were beaten at the church the night the Klan burned it in 1964.</p>

<p>Jackie (Steele) Spencer was 8 years old and at the church when the Klan came.</p>

<p>"I remember a little bit," she said. "... My brother was the last one who left out of the church because he cut the lights off.... I was going over to the car with him. ...We left the church from the left side. ... People from the right side got beat up, people from the left side didn't get beat up."</p>

<p>Leroy Clemons is an alderman in Philadelphia who also does civil rights tours in Neshoba County and was part of the Philadelphia Coalition that demanded that Killen be brought to justice. He emphasized that you cannot tell the story of the jail without the Mt. Zion church story, which also hinges on Mt. Nebo Missionary Baptist Church in Philadelphia where civil-rights activists used to take shelter and organize. Martin Luther King Jr. led a memorial service there, a monument to Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner is in front of the church.</p>

<p>Obbie Riley, president of the Neshoba County Board of Supervisors and this reporter's stepfather, advocated for the entire story of the entire community to be told. "There were some bad things happened, and there's some good people that's here now," he said "[T]his is a story that is worth telling when it comes down to it."</p>

<p>The special resource study will take place over the next two years, and will accept public comment online and via the mail through June 1.</p>

<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Killen was convicted in 2015, when the correct date is 2005. The story has been updated to reflect that change. We regret the error. </p>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-16</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/16/undocumented-and-caught-system/ </p>

<p>Immigration authorities in Louisiana and Mississippi have filed nearly 3,000 deportation proceedings in the first three months in 2018, data from Syracuse University show. Photo by AP/File Photo</p>

<p>Immigration enforcement officials deported Yesica Paola Rojas-Baten, a 19-year-old Guatemalan woman, in December 2017 when she was flown from Texas to Guatemala. A month later, she was inside an SUV traveling through Hancock County, Miss. When sheriffs pulled over the SUV she was in and another SUV traveling with it, they found 18 total passengers who were all undocumented immigrants, a press release from the U.S. attorney Mike Hurst's office says.</p>

<p>U.S. Border Patrol agents took the passengers to the border-patrol station, and Rojas-Baten was charged in federal court for illegal re-entry. After pleading guilty, she faces up to two years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine, and a judge will sentence her in August.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old could face the other side of immigration prosecution through the federal court system, one that has caused outcry and concern due to the Federal Bureau of Prisons' use of private prisons.</p>

<p>Traditionally, the bureau houses undocumented immigrants charged with federal crimes in "criminal alien requirement" facilities. Private prison corporations run the BOP's 11 contract prisons. "The majority of BOP inmates in private prisons are sentenced criminal aliens who may be deported upon completion of their sentence," the Bureau of Prisons website states.</p>

<p>BOP released a report about its private contract prisons in 2016, which revealed the dangerous conditions inside these facilities. One of the private contract prisons, Adams County Correctional Center, is in Natchez, Miss. A correctional officer died there in 2012 when inmates rioted over poor conditions, including inadequate food and medical care.</p>

<p>The Corrections Corporation of America, which runs two of the BOP's 11 contract prisons, ran the Adams County facility at the time. The corporation has since changed its name to CoreCivic but did not lose its contract to operate the Natchez facility. In fact, when Donald Trump became president, CCA and the GEO Group, which runs seven of the 11 federal contract prisons, both saw significant bumps in their stock-market value, Forbes reported.</p>

<p>As of December 2015, more than 22,000 inmates, mainly undocumented immigrants, are housed in the Bureau of Prison's private facilities.</p>

<p>The path to incarceration for undocumented people living in the U.S. largely depends on whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents send them into the immigration courts system or if federal prosecutors charge them with a federal crime. In Rojas-Baten's case, Hurst's office coordinated with ICE officials to charge her with the federal crime of illegal re-entry.</p>

<p>The Facts About Immigration: A Former Border Czar Speaks</p>

<p>How Immigration Courts Work</p>

<p>When ICE agents pick up an undocumented person for the first time, they have several options and discretion to detain a person or not. If ICE agents choose to detain an undocumented immigrant, they are sent to an immigration detention facility. When agents arrest someone in Mississippi and want to detain them, they send them across state lines to Louisiana to Jena or Pine Prairie. There are two immigration courts in Louisiana: one in New Orleans and one in Oakdale.</p>

<p>When Trump became president, he promised a crackdown on undocumented immigrants—not just those who commit federal crimes but anyone who in the country illegally. The White House's strongest focus has been the border. A press release from the White House claims that the number of illegal border crossings has more than tripled in the past year.</p>

<p>"April 2018 was also the second month in a row that saw more than 37,000 individuals apprehended after entering the country illegally along our Southwest border. The need to enforce our laws, secure our border, and close our immigration loopholes has been further underscored by the recent arrival of a 'caravan' of individuals seeking to enter the United States," a White House press release says.</p>

<p>In order for those coming to America to seek asylum, they must come to the border with or without documents to ask for it, however. Mississippi National Guard sent 25 soldiers to the southwest Mexico border last week as a part of "Operation Guardian Support," the latest border security operation from ICE.</p>

<p>"Efforts to remove aliens once they illegally cross our border are hampered by glaring flaws in current statutory law and activist judicial constraints," a White House release says. "As a result, many aliens are apprehended and temporarily detained after illegally entering, only to be quickly released into the interior of the United States."</p>

<p>Data tell a different story, however. Despite the judicial backlog in immigration cases, ICE agents have filed nearly 3,000 deportation proceedings in immigration court for people picked up in Mississippi and Louisiana through March of 2018, Syracuse University TRAC data show.</p>

<p>If this rate continues, 2018 is likely to post the highest number of deportation proceedings filed by ICE in the two states than in recent years.</p>

<p>The majority of these cases are coded as "entry without inspection" or "other immigration charge," meaning the majority of deportation proceedings that ICE agents file in Louisiana and Mississippi are not for undocumented immigrants who have committed violent crimes.</p>

<p>Rather, despite increasing rhetoric about dangerous immigrants and transnational gangs, the majority of undocumented immigrants waiting for deportation committed the crime of being here illegally.</p>

<p>'This is My Only Chance'</p>

<p>Immigration attorney Amelia McGowan has worked with undocumented immigrants, who are detained in Jena or Pine Prairie in Louisiana, and sees little difference between those facilities and other prisons. She recalled seeing pregnant mothers with chains around their bellies and said everyone has to wear "scrubs" just like jumpsuits in federal or state prison.</p>

<p>Undocumented immigrants going through deportation proceedings could wait for months to see a judge, whereas someone like Rojas-Baten saw a judge quickly in the federal system. If she is sentenced for prison time, she will have to sit behind bars for two years. McGowan said a person charged with "criminal re-entry" will likely not get to see an immigration judge because they will have an active order for removal, meaning after serving their sentence, they will likely be deported immediately.</p>

<p>McGowan is working with some immigrants who are fleeing terrible conditions in their home countries and would rather be in prison than return to dangerous countries where they live.</p>

<p>"I did meet with people in Jena who had re-entered during the Obama administration. Most of them got caught again, and they would say, 'This is my only chance to live,'" she told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Many undocumented immigrants do not have access to legal assistance or attorneys. McGowan said people like Rojas-Baten, who have illegally re-entered the country, can ask a judge to not deport them if they fear for their lives.</p>

<p>"When you re-enter, you are allowed to seek withholding of removal if you can show you would be persecuted," McGowan said. "... You do have the possibility of appealing."</p>

<p>Via press releases, Hurst's office has publicly announced prosecutions against 21 undocumented immigrants this year. The majority of these cases involve immigrants illegally re-entering, like Rojas-Baten, or transporting undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>Families are literally being separated. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers are arresting more undocumented immigrants now than under the previous administration—nonviolent undocumented men and women as Donald Trump uses scare tactics about dangerous immigrant gangs to justify deportations and splitting up families for just the crime of being undocumented. Many of them fled danger and can be killed or "disappeared" if they return.</p>

<p>Young people with DACA status are in flux on a weekly basis depending on what the court says, then the White House, then the court in an endless feedback loop that seems to scream, "Does anyone care?"</p>

<p>Mississippi's two senators, both supporters of Trump's border wall, doubt the Senate will take up immigration reform in 2018. With more than half a year to go, leaders are leaving families in limbo. State taxpayer dollars are supporting enhanced border security, as the Mississippi National Guard joined several other forces to be a presence on the southwest border between the U.S. and Mexico.</p>

<p>While leaders put off creating any solutions, ICE and the U.S. Department of Justice are implementing their own kind of deportation plan. Attorney General Jeff Sessions wants to have more oversight and say-so into how immigration judges can rule.</p>

<p>Technically, the country's immigration courts are under DOJ's jurisdiction, and as Dara Lind writes for Vox, this means Sessions' power could only increase in the coming months. "[E]ven when a DOJ judge makes a ruling in an immigrant's favor and ICE prosecutors don't try to appeal the ruling, the attorney general's office could sweep in and overrule the judge," Lind writes.</p>

<p>Federal private prisons run by corporations—funded with taxpayer dollars—are the real winners to this approach, particularly if undocumented immigrants are charged in federal court and forced to sit in prison before being deported. The longer Congress waits, the more people will be thrown into a system with apparent rules that Sessions could change whenever he wants.</p>

<p>Congress must act to preserve DACA, implement measures to keep families together, and provide a path to citizenship for all immigrants who have done what they believe is best for their well-being and just do not have the documentation to prove it.</p>

<p>Meantime, if the U.S. is serious about saving lives on either side of the border, it is time to seriously reconsider the escalation of a shortsighted "war on drugs" that Sessions loves to fight.</p>

<p>JACKSON — In the sweltering Wednesday heat, the Jackson Police Department put on its annual Police Memorial Service to honor and commemorate the 17 JPD officers who have died in the line of duty since 1893.</p>

<p>The service opened with the national anthem, pledge of allegiance and a song selection from Erica Taylor, a student at Lanier High School. Then the audience of law enforcement officers, public officials and families of the fallen officers heard comments from Commander Stephen Wells, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the keynote speaker Judge James E. Graves Jr. of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

<p>Commander Wells set the tone for the event, illustrating what goes through an officer's mind every day before starting the job.</p>

<p>"What we have chosen in this profession is to be guardians of the communities of Jackson," he said. "Each day we kiss our own babies before going to work, only to go out and save other babies' lives. Every time we suit up, it's a moment we realize we put our own lives in harm's way."</p>

<p>Chief Moore talked about the first time he experienced a JPD officer killed in the line of duty—Officer Bobby J. Biggert in February 1989.</p>

<p>"It was one of the most horrifying feelings that I felt," Moore said. "And since that time any time that I ever hear that a law enforcement officer loses his or her life, whether it's here in Jackson, Missississippi, or any department, it is a bad bad feeling."</p>

<p>Mayor Lumumba, making what he called unusual brief remarks because of the rising temperatures, encouraged the family members and loved ones in the audience to focus on the positive aspects of the fallen officers' lives.</p>

<p>"I would challenge you to remember them in this regard ... not for the way in which they died but the lives they lived," the mayor said. "Because it is truly life that gives death its great significance. And these are individuals that lived lives of service and commitment to other individuals and that is worth commending more so than the way that they died. And so, we celebrate their lives today."</p>

<p>Judge Graves, a Mississippi native and an Obama-era appointee, spoke about the importance of law enforcement officers, but especially police.</p>

<p>"We are here to honor public servants, those who gave their lives in the line of duty," he said. "And for police officers, that line is the very front line in our criminal-justice system."</p>

<p>After the formal remarks, the families got to pay their respects to their fallen loved ones.</p>

<p>The family of the late Thomas D. Catchings Sr. had seven people go up to the stone memorial in front of JPD headquarters with an escort from the Jackson Police Department/Hinds County Sheriff's Office Honor Guard to bestow a single yellow rose at the base of the monument where Catchings' name and those of other slain JPD officers are etched into a plaque. Each family in attendance or a volunteer went through those same motions, and the families received a potted plant in exchange for placing the rose.</p>

<p>After the ceremony, Temeka Holden-Hutchins, Catchings' oldest daughter, told the Jackson Free Press about what happened to her father the fateful night in March 2005 when he was shot and killed.</p>

<p>Officer Catchings was heading to pick up some of his younger children after he had been at a motorcycle training, she said. Someone who had just been carjacked flagged him down, and Catchings pursued the car. Omar Hampton, 18, had stolen the car and when Catchings caught up with Hampton after he had driven the car into a ditch, Hampton fired his gun. Catchings returned fire, killing Hampton, and he succumbed to his wounds at the hospital later that day.</p>

<p>"I was six months pregnant when it happened...," Holden-Hutchins said. "This was the first grandchild, (my dad) knew I was pregnant and knew I was having a boy, so he was excited about that but he didn't get to meet him."</p>

<p>Holden-Hutchins said that her dad did not have a vest on, as he was off-duty at the time.</p>

<p>A lifetime resident of Jackson, Holden-Hutchins recently moved away to Texas, but still brought her young sons to attend the ceremony Wednesday morning because it means a lot to her.</p>

<p>"It makes you feel special that they're keeping hope alive for everybody else and recognizing the fallen officer," she said. "It's a lot, you know, when you put that uniform on—that's tough. You never know if you're going to come back home to your family."</p>

<p>With 39 homicides in the City of Jackson to date, Holden-Hutchins said she keeps up with the news, and she is not happy with the way thing are going in the City.</p>

<p>"It makes me feel sad that the City is going down like that .... It's just sad, everything that's going on every time you look at the news—The number of homicides, and it's not even summertime yet. It's crazy."</p>

<p>JACKSON — It was a blistering morning, but people from state government, nonprofit and advocacy organizations gathered at the Capitol to launch a public-health campaign, encouraging Mississippians to "think again" about their mental health on Tuesday, May 15.</p>

<p>Diana Mikula, the executive director of the Department of Mental Health, said the "Think Again" campaign is intended to encourage Mississippians to think about their physical and mental health together—and ask for help when they need it. DMH plans to provide community organizations, local hospitals and businesses with information to increase awareness about physical and mental health.</p>

<p>"It's bringing more people to the table. We can't do it in silos, and one agency can't do it alone," Mikula said on May 15.</p>

<p>Mary Currier, the state health officer, also spoke at the Capitol this week. She emphasized that mental and physical health actually impact the other.</p>

<p>"High stress levels are linked to common health issues like high blood pressure...," she said. "... People who are depressed or chronically stressed have a greater risk of illness."</p>

<p>Currier said it is important to eat healthy, get enough sleep and exercise, not just for physical health but also for mental-health benefits. Mikula hopes that the outreach campaign will encourage Mississippians to talk to their health-care providers about mental health. She said some doctors have mental-health screeners at their offices in the state. Otherwise, there are 14 community mental-health centers statewide.</p>

<p>The federal government sued Mississippi in 2016 for its over-reliance on institutionalization to treat mental-health problems statewide. That case is still in discovery. DMH has been in financial hot water at the Legislature in past years as a result—until 2018. The department seemed to shift course and did not ask for an increase in funding in the most recent legislative session. DMH received the same amount of funding that it did last year, as a result.</p>

<p>Mikula acknowledged that the state agencies are maximizing their state funds with DMH and the Department of Health partnering on the "Think Again" initiative.</p>

<p>"Our leadership needs to know that our agencies are working together and we do try to utilize the resources we have before we come asking for more," Mikula told reporters May 15.</p>

<h2 id="baltimorelawyernamesjpdofficerwhomayhaveshotcrystallinebarnes">Baltimore Lawyer Names JPD Officer Who May Have Shot Crystalline Barnes</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Jason Downs, a Baltimore lawyer who represented the family of Freddie Gray, called a press conference on May 14, 2018, to demand more transparency from the Jackson government on behalf of the family of Crystalline Barnes, 21, who died in an an officer-involved shooting. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — A lawyer for the family of 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes, who died in January when two Jackson Police Officers shot into her car following a traffic stop, stood alongside Barnes' young children and family members Monday as he demanded more transparency from the Jackson government. Jason Downs called Barnes' death an "egregious case" and named one of the officers he believes pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Jason Downs of Downs Collins Law Firm in Baltimore told reporters that an independent investigation showed that JPD Officer Rakasha Adams was directly involved in the shooting of Crystalline. Downs said his investigation showed that Adams had admitted in writing to having difficulty concentrating and that she is easily irritated and angered.</p>

<p>"We have an officer that admits to being easily angered walking the streets of Jackson armed with a gun," Downs said. "We believe that these factors play a role in Officer Adams' unjustified decision to shoot at Crystalline."</p>

<p>Downs said he has an idea about who the second officer at the scene could be, but could not confirm his identity as of yet. He hopes any witnesses his office has not yet spoken to will come forward. The Jackson Police Department said it cannot confirm any of the details shared at the press conference, but that the two officers involved in Barnes' death are still on paid leave per JPD policy.</p>

<p>Holding the presser the day after Mother's Day, Downs pointed to Barnes' children to illustrate the impact of her death.</p>

<p>"Crystalline's two children had to spend Mother's Day without their mother," he said. "Today, nearly four months after Crystalline was shot in the back of the head, the Jackson government still has not updated the family, nor have they updated the public as to the results of their alleged investigation."</p>

<p>Downs was one of the lawyers who represented the family of Freddie Gray in Baltimore following his in-custody death in 2015 resulting from a severed spinal cord. The attorney said his investigation shows that Barnes was shot from behind in the back of the head, which he believes contradicts JPD's account of what happened.</p>

<p>In January, Jackson Police Department spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said the officer who pulled Barnes over in a traffic stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," Holmes' statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect's vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Holmes said Barnes then drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>Downs said his investigation shows that there were no bullet holes in the front windshield or in the front of Barnes' car.</p>

<p>"The investigation shows Crystalline was driving forward, she was shot in the back of the head, and there were absolutely no bullets that traveled through the front of Crystalline's vehicle. The Jackson government has completely failed to address all of these factors—the Jackson government has been silent," Downs said.</p>

<p>Downs also takes issue with the lack of transparency around officer-involved shootings in the City of Jackson. During the press conference, Downs mentioned the U.S. Department of Justice's recommendations to release names as early as 48 hours following the incident, as some cities across the nation have chosen to do, especially since the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press has reported that in 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice advised police departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident. The DOJ report said that departments can take steps to ensure officer safety during those brief delays.</p>

<p>Jackson, however, has a longstanding policy of remaining tight-lipped throughout the investigation into officer-involved shootings, keeping the public blind about officers' names, whether or not officers get indicted following deadly shootings, or if some of the same officers have been involved in multiple incidents.</p>

<p>"The United States Department of Justice also notes that when a police department fails to provide names of officers after an officer shoots and kills a civilian, that erodes the trust between the community and the police department," Downs said Monday. "The Jackson Police Department has utterly ignored the United States Department of Justice, so we conducted our own independent investigation."</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba developed an officer-identification task force in March to help decide whether to change City policy on not identifying officers following officer-involved shootings. Since the group began meeting in April, the task-force has held three meetings, but has mainly discussed organizational topics rather than delving into the meat of their task.</p>

<p>Downs said he was aware of the task force but that Jackson is still not operating with transparency. He hinted that the City may face a lawsuit if it does not change the policy of keeping the officers' identities and other details hidden.</p>

<p>"We are hoping that Jackson begins to share more information with us, information regarding the identity of the shooters, information regarding exactly what led to the shooting, why there are no bullet holes to the front of the vehicle at all, how she crashed head on, but they claim she was driving backwards somehow," Downs told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"We'd like answers to these questions, and we're hopeful that although they haven't done it as of now, we're hopeful moving forward."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A police officer in Mississippi's capital city is on paid leave as officials investigate whether he unfairly attacked a teen.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Chief Anthony Moore tells local media Tuesday that the department has launched an internal investigation into the incident early Monday.</p>

<p>Moore says reports on the traffic stop conflict but says the department doesn't condone illegal behavior and will discipline the officer for any violations.</p>

<p>The chief made the announcement after parents complained that the unnamed officer pulled John Knight III out of his car, punched him and put a gun to his head without provocation.</p>

<p>Knight was released without charges. His father posted images of his son's cuts and scrapes on Facebook</p>

<p>Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba says he spoke with Knight's father and is deeply troubled.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Voters in central Mississippi's 3rd District are choosing a new member of Congress for the first time in a decade. Candidates have been traveling for weeks to speak at forums and fish fries, and the heavy rotation of advertising—for those who can afford it—is expected to begin close to Memorial Day.</p>

<p>Party primaries are June 5, and if a runoff is needed to choose the Republican nominee, it will be June 26.</p>

<p>Rep. Gregg Harper of Pearl was first elected in 2008 to what was then an open seat because fellow Republican Chip Pickering stepped aside after 12 years. Harper announced early this year that he wouldn't seek another term, saying he thinks a decade in Washington is enough.</p>

<p>The district encompasses all of 20 counties and parts of four others. It runs in a diagonal across the middle of the state, from two counties that touch the Mississippi River in the southwestern corner, up through the more densely populated suburbs of Madison and Rankin counties in the Jackson metro area and further northeast to the college town of Starkville and over to the Alabama line.</p>

<p>Six candidates are in the Republican primary. Because a majority is needed to win, it is likely to go to runoff.</p>

<p>Sally Doty , 51, of Brookhaven, is an attorney and second-term state senator.</p>

<p>Morgan Dunn , 36, of Magee, founded a health care consulting firm, and she and her husband own a restaurant.</p>

<p>Michael Guest , 48, of Brandon, is the district attorney in Madison and Rankin counties.</p>

<p>Whit Hughes , 43, of Madison, is a past deputy director of the state economic development agency and has been foundation president and chief development officer for Baptist Health Systems.</p>

<p>Perry Parker , 52, of Seminary, had a career in international finance, working in Chicago, New York, London and Santa Barbara, California, before moving back to his native Mississippi; he also helped found a bank in Hattiesburg.</p>

<p>Katherine "Bitzi" Tate , 61, of Jackson, is an education consultant.</p>

<p>Two candidates are competing in the 3rd District Democratic primary.</p>

<p>Michael Ted Evans , 42, of Preston, is a second-term state representative and retired firefighter. Michael Aycox , 30, of Newton, is a Navy veteran.</p>

<p>The most recent campaign finance reports show how much money the candidates raised and spent between Jan. 1 and March 31. Hughes led the field, having collected $304,354. Next was Guest, at $280,911.</p>

<p>Parker collected $102,032 and loaned his own campaign $240,000. Doty collected $65,059 and loaned her own campaign $15,802. Dunn collected $30,600 and loaned her own campaign $73,100. Tate did not file a report to the Federal Election Commission.</p>

<p>On the Democratic side, Aycox reported $100 in contributions and Evans did not file a report.</p>

<p>The 3rd District has been considered solidly Republican territory since it was created after the 2000 Census. Mississippi went from five U.S. House districts to four because it had grown more slowly than other states. The current 3rd District consists largely of territory combined from the former 3rd that was represented by Pickering and the former 4th that was represented by Democrat Ronnie Shows. Pickering and Shows were pitted against each other in the redrawn 3rd District in 2002, and Pickering won.</p>

<p>For a Democrat to compete in the general election this year, the party and the nominee will need to quickly accelerate their fundraising efforts.</p>

<p>Winners of the Republican and Democratic primaries will advance to the Nov. 6 general election, and the ballot then will also list Matthew Holland as a Reform Party candidate for the 3rd District.</p>

<p>JACKSON — At the most recent city council meeting on May 8, the members gathered at City Hall to vote on a variety of issues from shifting budgets, to an ongoing concert and event series in Jackson.</p>

<p>To help with the City's public-works needs, the council accepted Director of Public Works Bob Miller's item that moved $6.9 million from the City's Municipal Sales Tax Commission, which oversees the 1 percent sales tax revenue, into his department. Public Works will use more than $4 million to reimburse the department's capital improvement fund, and the remaining $2 million will go toward the January 2018 winter emergency costs and to repair utility cuts to pavement throughout the City.</p>

<p>"This is a relatively simple matter that amends the budget to reflect the transfer of funds from the municipal sales tax commission to the water and sewer department," Miller said at the meeting.</p>

<p>The council also voted to increase the budget in the Department of Parks and Recreation to fill in for a Bloomberg grant the City has still not received. In a memo to the council, Ison B. Harris Jr., the director of parks and recreation, said that the department is in dire need of 15 more workers and more equipment to keep up with grass maintenance.</p>

<p>In anticipation of receiving this grant in January 2018, the parks department cut positions and transferred six park maintenance workers to Public Works. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at the meeting that the grant was supposed to help the City with a recidivism program that would bring "returning citizens" and hire them to cut grass throughout Jackson. But, until then, the City is moving $285,000 from vacant positions to hire people who will tend weeds in the capital city.</p>

<p>Between the last two meetings, the council has also voted to spend nearly $200,000 from the Parks and Recreation budget to hire musical acts and a promotional team for the City's ongoing Jackson Soulful Music and Event Series. Harris said this money was set aside during budget hearings last year, and with sponsors and charging an admission fee for some of the events, he hopes to at least break even.</p>

<p>"This is our first time doing this," Harris said before the council. "We want to be as successful as we possibly can this first year. ... The idea is to bring people to Jackson and to have fun activities for kids in Jackson."</p>

<p>Ward 2 Councilman Melvin Priester Jr. walked out of the room before voting on the concert items, leaving the council with an even split. First up was the the $25,000 agreement to secure soul singer Betty Wright's performance at the Blues in the Park concert on June 17. The vote came to 3-3, with Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes, Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote and Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps opposing. When Stokes looked over to see that he had sided with Foote, he got up and left the room for the remainder of the votes on the concert series.</p>

<p>"Woah, I can't vote with Foote. Let me walk out of here," he said before slipping out of a side door.</p>

<p>Besides Wright, the City has secured Maze featuring Frankie Beverly, Dexter Allen, Erica Campbell, a fireworks show, Howard Hewett, Lakeside, Jekalyn Carr, Small Fire, the Keeshea Pratt Band, Canton Jones, Bobby Rush and William "Zac" Harmon for concerts over the next few summer months.</p>

<p>One day before Jackson's third deadly officer-involved shooting, the council entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations to have the state agency investigate officer-involved shooting incidents and in-custody deaths.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The latest deadly officer-involved shooting in Jackson resulted from a traffic stop. A Jackson Police Department officer pulled over Elliot Reed, 30, and Chauncy Reed, 26, apparently brothers, in a white SUV around 1 a.m. on Wednesday at the Valero in the 900 block of Cooper Road.</p>

<p>From there, the details from JPD are vague. A statement says that "following that encounter, shots were fired, both from the suspects and the officer."</p>

<p>The officer, who is now on paid administrative leave per JPD protocol, did not sustain serious injuries. But Elliot Reed was critically injured and transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead by mid-morning. Police took Chauncy into custody at the scene, and charged him with aggravated assault on a police officer and capital murder. Sgt. Roderick Holmes of the Jackson Police Department told the Jackson Free Press that Chauncy is facing the capital murder charge because he was committing the felony of assault on an officer that resulted in a murder.</p>

<p>Aggravated assault on a police officer carries a potential punishment of up to 30 years in prison and no more than a $5,000 fine. Capital murder carries a death sentence, life imprisonment with or without parole.</p>

<p>This represents the third deadly officer-involved shooting of the year following the death of Crystalline Barnes, 21, in January and Lee Edward Bonner, 37, in February.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Bureau of Investigations is investigating this case, as it has done in the Jackson area of late. MBI is also handling the Bonner case from February, after a foot pursuit through west Jackson led to an abandoned house where Bonner allegedly brandished a weapon and two officers fired at least a dozen rounds, killing Bonner.</p>

<p>To formalize the relationship between MBI and the City of Jackson, the Jackson City Council voted on a memorandum of understanding between the two entities to have MBI investigate officer-involved shootings and in-custody deaths. The Council voted 6-1, with Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes opposing.</p>

<p>"We don't feel that it is a good practice to investigate yourself in these circumstances," Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba said at the city council meeting. "So to date, they are already prepared to come on scene, but they asked for a formal agreement that would initiate their action in circumstances of officer-involved shootings."</p>

<p>As JPD protocol states in its use-of-force policy, the department will still conduct an internal investigation alongside MBI. The identity of the officer in this shooting is unknown, as has been the case with the last seven other officer-involved shootings in Jackson since Lumumba took office in July 2017—and the lack of transparency likely dates back long before then. The public is not kept abreast of any period of the investigation, even the results of the grand juries that review these cases.</p>

<p>To address this, the mayor established an officer-identification task force by way of executive order in March 2017. The task force is responsible for developing City policy for whether or not JPD will release names of officers who shoot people in the line of duty or keep them private unless a grand jury indicts the officer.</p>

<p>Joe Atkins</p>

<p>OXFORD—My late friend Marty Fishgold, a longtime labor writer in New York City, liked to say that "good journalism is a subversive activity" because it tells truth to power. Veteran Boston journalist Tom Oliphant said "Good reporters are anarchists" because they question all ideologies and authority.</p>

<p>Those are good things, and that's why journalism gets special protection in the First Amendment. It may be the best-known promise in that document and why the constitutions of nations as far-flung as Poland, Brazil, Egypt and Bangladesh include such language as well. One could argue that many of those countries don't practice what they preach. Well, guess what? We don't always, either.</p>

<p>Take the case of Manuel Duran, who currently sits in prison in Jena, La. Duran, who owns the Spanish-language news outlet Memphis Noticias, came to Memphis after working as a reporter in his native El Salvador, a war-and-drug-torn country whose cruelest goons trained at the School of the Americas in Fort Benning, Ga. He's now facing deportation back there, perhaps the equivalent of a death sentence.</p>

<p>Let's consider why he sits in prison in Jena, which Father Michael McAndrew, who works with immigrant communities in Greenwood and north Mississippi, says is one of the "worst detention centers" in the U.S. for its treatment of immigrants.</p>

<p>On April 3 in downtown Memphis, police arrested Duran and eight others who were protesting immigration policies. Police said they were blocking a roadway, and Duran refused to move as ordered. The protest also took place without a permit, police said. Two days later, prosecutors dropped charges against Duran.</p>

<p>He was far from a free man, however. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers immediately arrested him and sent him to Jena. ICE officials said he missed a scheduled appearance in an immigration court in Atlanta in 2007 and thus had since been living in the States without legal status. His attorneys said he received no notice to appear that day, and they have asked the Atlanta court to reopen the case.</p>

<p>If Barack Obama were still president, Duran might be free since he has no criminal history other than misdemeanor driving offenses. Under President Trump, however, none of the 11 million immigrants in this country without full legal status are even temporarily safe from deportation.</p>

<p>"The actions pursued by government officials in this case threaten core First Amendment freedoms that are essential to our democracy," says a federal petition by the Southern Poverty Law Center seeking Duran's release.</p>

<p>Duran's greatest "crime" may be that he has been critical of the Memphis Police Department in his reporting. In July 2017, he reported in a Facebook post allegations that immigration enforcement officials and Memphis police had joined in a traffic stop operation, despite claims that they do not work together. Memphis police asked him to take down the post. His coverage also raised questions about police handling of the case of a Latino immigrant whose body was found in a police impound lot 49 days after he was shot in a robbery.</p>

<p>The Duran case evokes memories of what happened in Jackson to Daniela Vargas, a 22-year-old native of Argentina who had been living in the U.S. since the age of 7. Despite earlier protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, her more recent lapsed status resulted in a March 1 arrest and federal deportation proceedings. A SPLC petition helped win her release nine days later, but her fate remains as uncertain as Manuel Duran's.</p>

<p>Jacksonians and some Rankin County residents who now pay for flood insurance, as well as some who pay nothing, could be included in the footprint of taxable households to fund the Rankin-Hinds Flood Control District's current lake plan. Photo by</p>

<p>If you haven't paid attention to the proposed flood-control/development project called "One Lake" along the Pearl River, now is the time to help vet the ambitious plan. Jacksonians and some Rankin County residents who now pay for flood insurance, as well as some who pay nothing, could be included in the footprint of taxable households to fund the Rankin-Hinds Flood Control District's current lake plan. And if you're included in the new district's boundaries, you need to ensure you would get flood-control benefits.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Legislature gave the district the ability to tax you even if you get "indirect" flood benefits, something so vague in state law that taxpayers should demand answers for what qualifies. The report may go public this month with public hearings as the project's backers look for quick consensus.</p>

<p>Once local comment is complete, the project heads to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for approval. Several wildlife groups oppose the project for its potential negative impacts on the river itself and the local wildlife, like the local extinction of certain species of turtles. Opponents advocate for alternative flood-control options, but lake backers have rejected alternatives with little public input.</p>

<p>Taxpayers need to leave no stone unturned: Why is "One Lake" the best flood-control option? How will it work? Who will pay? Who will benefit from property that will increase in value? Who owns all the property? How will eminent domain work?</p>

<p>Cost-benefit ratios for the previous versions of a lake development along the Pearl were unjustifiable. The "One Lake" proposal will not help localized flooding—such as a drain that overflows during heavy rains or a creek that floods. This project strictly deals with the Pearl River. "One Lake" backers are adamant that it is not about economic development, especially because developing in the floodplain is always a danger, but the same developer of previous versions formed the foundation that is co-sponsoring the study.</p>

<p>Many answers to these questions may be found in the more-than-1,000-page report when it is released. It may be late in the game, but show up to public meetings, call your mayors (Jackson, Flowood, Pearl and Richland), and demand answers before the project is rubberstamped.

<h2 id="texassuitcouldspeeddacaspathtosupremecourt">Texas Suit Could Speed DACA's Path to Supreme Court</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-10</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/10/texas-suit-could-speed-dacas-path-supreme-court/ </p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Three judges have ordered the Trump administration to continue a program that has shielded hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation. Now, a lawsuit filed last week in Texas seeks to shut down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and may create a legal clash that could speed the issue's path to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump's decision in September to phase out the Obama-era program, called DACA, resulted in protests and a failed congressional effort to salvage it. Experts say it's a matter of when, not if, the Supreme Court will rule on the program. It could be the second opportunity for the high court to weigh in on a high-profile decision of the president's, with a ruling on Trump's travel ban expected before the end of June.</p>

<p>Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, said the Texas lawsuit filed May 1 tees up "a fast pass to the Supreme Court."</p>

<p>If Texas and six other states persuade a judge to issue a nationwide order barring the government from continuing DACA, that decision could conflict with existing judges' orders telling the government it must partially continue the program. That's the kind of conflict the Supreme Court generally steps in to address.</p>

<p>The high court has already finished hearing arguments ahead of its summer break at the end of June, and it's rare for the court to hear arguments again before October. But if judges issue conflicting orders on what the government must do with DACA, the court might be asked to make an interim, procedural decision, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell University's law school. The Texas lawsuit "creates even more uncertainty in what is going to happen," he said.</p>

<p>DACA, created in 2012, has provided protection from deportation and work permits for about 800,000 young people who came to the U.S. as children and stayed illegally. A person enrolled in the program gets protection from deportation that lasts two years and can be renewed.</p>

<p>Judges in California and New York have ruled that the Trump administration must allow current DACA participants to renew their enrollments, but the government doesn't have to process new applications. A ruling by a judge in the District of Columbia would require the government to also process new applications, but it has been put on hold until late July.</p>

<p>While these lawsuits challenged Trump's decision to wind down DACA, the lawsuit filed by Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, South Carolina and West Virginia aims to end it. The states argue the creation of the program was unlawful, an overreach by President Barack Obama, a conclusion the Trump administration agrees with.</p>

<p>And the states filed the case in a way to put it before a potentially sympathetic judge, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas.</p>

<p>Hanen criticized the Obama administration for lax enforcement of immigration laws. And in 2015 he ruled against an expansion of DACA by Obama as well as a program that would have protected the parents of children who are in the country legally. His ruling blocking the programs was upheld by an appeals court. The Supreme Court, short a member after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, was divided 4-4 on the case in 2016, leaving the lower court's ruling in place.</p>

<p>University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck said the Texas case "increases the likelihood of conflicting orders to the government and conflicting substantive conclusions about DACA's legality."</p>

<p>If Hanen sides with the states, he could order the government to immediately stop processing new DACA applications or renewing old ones, which would contradict the existing orders. That would create a "pretty chaotic" situation that the Supreme Court would likely want to resolve, Vladeck said.</p>

<p>Beyond what happens in Texas, two courts of appeal are readying to weigh in on DACA, too. Arguments before the San Francisco-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit are scheduled for Tuesday. And arguments before the New York City-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit are expected this summer.</p>

<p>There is also the possibility that the Trump administration could issue a new memo, replacing one from September, with a fuller explanation of why it chose to wind down DACA, a move that would lead to another flurry of legal filings. The fact the administration hasn't yet done that, though, suggests it may be reluctant to do so.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has seemed eager to get the issue to the Supreme Court quickly. Earlier this year it took the unusual step of asking the high court to hear the California case before a federal appeals court had ruled on it. The high court declined to do so in late February, but it may not be able to avoid the issue for long.</p>

<p>"We're moving toward the Supreme Court," Vladeck said. "How quickly depends on what happens next."</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Actors Robert DeNiro and Alec Baldwin are giving some fundraising help to a Democrat hoping to unseat Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Howard Sherman is one of six Democrats in the June 5 primary. He is married to actress Sela Ward, and they have a home near Meridian, Mississippi, where she was raised. The couple previously lived in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Sherman's campaign spokesman David Davis confirms that DeNiro and Baldwin helped host a cocktail party Tuesday in New York, with suggested campaign donations of $1,000 to $5,400 per person.</p>

<p>Wicker faces one challenger in the GOP primary. He sent out his own fundraising email Wednesday, calling DeNiro and Baldwin "mega liberals" who have insulted President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>"Alec Baldwin is popular among liberals for his malicious and inaccurate portrayal of President Trump on Saturday Night Live," the Wicker email says. "Robert DeNiro has said the following about our president: 'I'd like to punch him in the face. This is somebody that we want for president? I don't think so.'"</p>

<p>DeNiro also has appeared on "Saturday Night Live," playing special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.</p>

<p>Like many incumbents, Wicker has received campaign contributions from a variety of political action committees, including those pooling money from insurance, energy and financial firms. He also got a $5,000 contribution from Sherman last year, according to Federal Election Commission records.</p>

<p>Sherman has said he donated because Wicker was facing the prospect of a primary challenge at the time by Chris McDaniel, a tea party-backed state lawmaker who nearly unseated longtime U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran in a bitter 2014 Republican primary.</p>

<p>Cochran resigned from the Senate in April amid health concerns, and Republican Gov. Phil Bryant appointed the state agriculture commissioner, Cindy Hyde-Smith to temporarily fill the Senate seat. McDaniel had qualified to challenge Wicker this year, but switched races to challenge Hyde-Smith instead this November for the final two years of Cochran's term. Two Democrats are also in that race.</p>

<p>Sherman was registered to vote as a Republican in California until 2016, when he enrolled in Mississippi, where people don't register by party. He's been his own biggest donor so far. A finance report shows that through the end of March, he had put $500,000 into his own campaign, and had received just one donation, from his campaign manager, for $1,000.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Sixteen of Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba's 21 appointees to the officer-identification task force gathered at The Cedars in Fondren Monday night to decide if and how the Jackson Police Department will release names of police officers who are involved in shootings, as well as the timeframe in which that would take place.</p>

<p>It was the group's third meeting, five weeks into the effort to resolve difficult questions around exactly when the public has the right to know the identity and circumstances around an officer-involved shooting in Jackson.</p>

<p>The mayor developed this task force under an executive order at the end of March because JPD has a longstanding practice of not releasing names of officers who shoot people, but nothing formally on the books. With eight (there were seven at press time, with another one taking place early Wednesday morning) reported officer-involved shootings since Lumumba took office in July 2017, the mayor seeks a solution through community input, even as he leans toward releasing officer identities.</p>

<p>"It is time that we adopt a city policy which reflects the unique responsibilities and the unique concerns of both law enforcement and the concerns of citizens," Mayor Lumumba said at the first task-force meeting on April 11.</p>

<p>But before the task force dealt with its mission Monday night, it debated whether they should widen the scope even further. The discourse revealed the emotional undercurrents of this issue and also the need for structure and clarity as the task force gets further into the process.</p>

<p>Enter a 'Monkey Wrench'</p>

<p>At Monday's meeting, the task force hashed out something that has been eating away at their progress for weeks: Should the task force also tackle larger criminal-justice issues? Members discussed whether they should ask the mayor to expand the scope of the task force so that the members could also consider procedures such as reworking the City's nearly 15 year-old use-of-force policy and creating policy around excessive force in a broader sense.</p>

<p>JPD Officer Christian Vance made the point that officer-involved shootings, while the circumstances can vary, tend to be more cut-and-dried compared to excessive-force situations that can range from using a Taser to a baton. Vance said that with excessive force, you have to be there to understand the issues at play.</p>

<p>"I am resigned to the fact that people are not always going to understand what I'm doing and that's fine and might see it and be upset, and that's OK if I'm doing my job and doing it correctly," he said. "... How I deal with community policing—policing is not what happens at the call; policing is everything in between the call."</p>

<p>Paul Hobson, a JPD detective and president of the Jackson Police Officers Association, also characterized excessive force as "subjective." The union leader reminded the group that its singular task is to develop policy around officer-involved shootings, without getting into the weeds and particulars of use-of-force policies.</p>

<p>"With respect to use of force, none of us are qualified to make those determinations, so that's my monkey wrench," Hobson said.</p>

<p>Keyshia Sanders, director of constituent services for the City of Jackson and a non-voting member of the committee, urged the group to stay focused on the narrow task because she was concerned about losing some of the volunteers who agreed to serve and develop policy around officer-involved shootings only.</p>

<p>Since Rukia Lumumba, the mayor's sister and a social and economic justice advocate, started attending the task-force meetings, she has served as a de-facto facilitator to help discussions move swiftly and to ensure that those who want to speak get time to do so, and that not all the meetings are in police facilities.</p>

<p>Although the group did not get through all the agenda items Monday, her presence ushered the group toward reaching the consensus that they would stick within the mayor's original order for the task force before getting to deep into other criminal-justice issues in the City.</p>

<p>The group ultimately voted 11-4 to keep the scope narrow, with Rukia Lumumba, Jed Oppenheim of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Nsombi Lambright of One Voice, Inc. and attorney CJ Lawrence who chairs the task force voting nay, and Hobson abstaining from the vote.</p>

<p>Transparency, Debated</p>

<p>Outside the roughly half-dozen police officers who regularly attend the ID task-force meetings, few people have a clear idea of how the Jackson Police Department handles officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>Both police officers and other community members did agree Monday on the need for transparency when an officer shoots someone, but debated whether that means releasing names but no photographs or keeping the names sealed but informing the community regularly about the status of the investigation.</p>

<p>Many came to the table with firm stances about protecting officers' names and identities unless a grand jury indicts them. Two officers spoke about the dangers of the job and the perceived heightened risk of retaliation if their identities are out there.</p>

<p>"How do you assess my danger?" Vance said. "I don't know how you assess an immediate threat to me. ... [W]hen you do release my picture that threat goes up—it's not a problem until it's a problem."</p>

<p>Michael Starks, a Vietnam War veteran also on the task force, passionately agreed with Vance.</p>

<p>"I'm in favor of not putting that officer out front until all the investigation is done, not only for his safety, his family's safety," he said. Starks also advocated for more relationships between the community and JPD.</p>

<p>Many on the task force have expressed concern about releasing a photograph of the officer to the media following an officer-involved shooting. But Lambright said most people in the community already know who the officers are, so the photographs are less of a concern and that people really want to know what happens afterward in terms of discipline.</p>

<p>Lawrence, task-force chairman, agreed with Lambright. "I think that the ambiguity comes in when if I can't even get your photograph, I can't even hear about who it was that it committed the action, then there's no way that I have any understanding of what it is that is truly going on in this particular process...," Lawrence said Monday.</p>

<p>"I think it's the ability not to necessarily tell the community every step of he investigation what's going on, but to keep the community engaged with regard to the fact that something is going on...."</p>

<p>At Monday's meeting, the group agreed to bring in guests from JPD's internal affairs unit, which investigates officer-involved shootings among other accusations against police officers; a representative from the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations, which investigates officer-involved shootings in the Jackson metropolitan area; and a representative from the Hinds County district attorney's office, which handles the grand jury proceedings in these cases once an investigation comes to a close and an officer is charged. The task force has not identified the guests, yet.</p>

<p>With their clearer scope in mind, members will reconvene May 21 at a location that has yet to be announced.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, wants medical marijuana legalized nationwide. The state minority whip is one of six candidates running to be the Democratic nominee for U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker's seat.</p>

<p>"I can tell you without reservation that I am in favor of legalizing medical marijuana that can be prescribed while under a doctor's care," he said May 2 on a telephone town-hall call, answering a caller's question. "I know that medical marijuana has benefits for patients suffering from PTSD and for folks experiencing pain, like cancer patients."</p>

<p>Baria even suggested that legal medical marijuana could reduce opioid use nationwide, which has been deemed a national crisis. Currently, marijuana is illegal at the federal level, although some states have legalized the substance on their own terms. Nine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized marijuana for all uses, including recreational and medical. Mississippi has decriminalized the possession of marijuana under 30 grams for the first conviction.</p>

<p>On the town-hall call, Baria stopped short of supporting legalalizing marijuana for recreational purposes.</p>

<p>"I am in favor of leaving it to the states and keeping the federal prosecutors out of states where it has been legalized, so (in) states like California and Colorado, I don't believe the federal prosecutors should go in there and start prosecuting folks for that," he said.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has taken a hard line on prosecuting marijuana-related charges. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memo in January directing all U.S. attorneys to enforce and follow federal laws in regards to marijuana-related "activities."</p>

<p>"[T]oday's memo on federal marijuana enforcement simply directs all U.S. attorneys to use previously established prosecutorial principles that provide them all the necessary tools to disrupt criminal organizations, tackle the growing drug crisis, and thwart violent crime across our country," Sessions said in a Jan. 4 press release.</p>

<p>About six in 10 Americans favor the legalization of marijuana, Pew research shows.</p>

<p>An ACLU analysis found that the large majority of marijuana arrests in the country are for possession, not for selling or distributing. Additionally, African Americans are nearly four times more likely than white people to be arrested for marijuana, the analysis found.</p>

<p>The primary election for Wicker's seat in Congress is on June 5. Baria, who faces six candidates in the Democratic primary, has raised the most individual donations, FEC filings show. He has more than $120,000 on hand. Howard Sherman has the most funds at his disposal, however, after he loaned his campaign half a million dollars. Other candidates have raised less than $1,000 or do not have campaign-finance reports filed, yet.</p>

<p>Wicker, who faces Richard Warren Boyantan in the Republican primary, has held his Senate seat since 2007. He has $3.4 million in cash on hand, the most recent FEC filings show.</p>

<h2 id="privateprisonontrialinmatesatbleakfacilitytellharrowingstories">Private Prison on Trial: Inmates at ‘Bleak’ Facility Tell Harrowing Stories</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-02</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/may/02/private-prison-trial-inmates-bleak-facility-tell-h/ </p>

<p>Inmates at EMCF have attempted to get relief from the federal court system since 2013 for appalling health care, sanitation and safety conditions they list in their lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Photo by MDOC</p>

<p>Merlin Hill could not stop shaking as the bailiff led him to the witness stand. The prisoner was still trembling as he raised his right, cuffed hand to swear he would tell the truth on March 15, 2018, in the fourth-floor federal courtroom in downtown Jackson.</p>

<p>Hill, a gaunt white man in his 50s, wore glasses, a white "MDOC CONVICT" shirt and black-and-white striped pants. He was one of 19 inmates who testified during the five-week class-action trial against the Mississippi Department of Corrections for what they describe as appalling conditions at the privately run East Mississippi Correctional Facility near Meridian.</p>

<p>Unlike his appearance, Hill's testimony seemed steadier. Southern Poverty Law Center attorney Jody Owens asked Hill about his medication regimen, a lengthy combination of drugs that, Hill said, helped him feel "normal." Hill said one of his medications, Klonopin, keeps him from shaking, but had run out the night before, just like it does almost every month. He is diagnosed with paranoia, schizophrenia, depression and bipolar disorder, among other conditions, he said. Without his medication, his disorders can be unbearable.</p>

<p>"Sometimes I have murderous thoughts, suicidal thoughts, it's unbearable sometimes," he told the court.</p>

<p>Hill was convicted of rape in 1998, choosing to serve a life sentence after he opted against taking a plea deal. He is one of more than 1,200 inmates at EMCF where MDOC houses a large population of inmates with mental-health needs.</p>

<p>Eighty percent of inmates at the prison facility are mentally ill.</p>

<p>In 2013, a group of inmates sued the Mississippi Department of Corrections over treatment, conditions and care they claim are unconstitutional at the prison. The litigation dragged on, and in 2015, U.S. Senior District Judge William H. Barbour certified the case as a class-action complaint on behalf of all inmates at EMCF. After failed settlement agreements, the case finally went to trial this spring.</p>

<p>The question at the heart of the case is whether any of the inmates' seven claims, from lack of sanitation or safety to medical care, violate their Eighth Amendment rights to be free from "cruel and unusual punishment."</p>

<p>'Pill Call' Behind Bars</p>

<p>At least two inmates sat in on the trial every day, usually chained around the waist, some handcuffed. Employees from the prison as well as the court bailiff sat behind them or in the public court seating. Attorneys from New York and Washington, D.C., with the ACLU National Prison Project and the private firm Covington &amp; Burling joined local SPLC attorneys to represent the inmates. They were a diverse line-up of men and women, constantly changing who was taking the lead each day.</p>

<p>A smaller group of private attorneys, from Bradley and Phelps Dunbar, who were all white and predominantly male, represented the state. The warden at EMCF, Frank Shaw, usually sat with the defense attorneys and was in court for the majority of the trial. The plaintiffs' presentation lasted nearly a month, with attorneys calling inmates, staff workers at the prison and experts to testify about conditions there.</p>

<p>Inmates testified that EMCF nurses bring their medications to the window of the zone and say "pill call." If they do not make it up to the window at that time or hear the call, they can miss getting their medication altogether.</p>

<p>Warden Shaw testified that sometimes pill call happen on schedule, even as it is set once for the morning and once for the evening. When asked if staff has skipped pill call, Shaw said "it's happened before."</p>

<p>The private prison claims to offer individual and group therapy, but throughout the course of the trial, evidence revealed that the facility only recently opened an acute mental-health unit. Plaintiffs' attorney Erin Monju pointed out in her closing argument that the new facility on Housing Unit 3 is serving about five inmates, with some receiving group therapy and none receiving individual therapy as of trial time.</p>

<p>Inmates also testified to starting fires when they could not get the attention of picket officers or other officers when they needed medical or mental-care attention.</p>

<p>EMCF is one of three operational private prisons in Mississippi, all of which Utah-based Management and Training Company operates. MTC took over the contract to operate EMCF in 2012. Mississippi taxpayers pay MTC over $150 million in contract fees to house about 3,200 inmates in the three private facilities.</p>

<p>MDOC contracts with MTC to run EMCF and also pays Centurion, a subsidiary company of the Centene Corporation to provide medical and mental-health services at the Meridian facility. The State has a monitor, Vernell Thomas, who can oversee the prison and activity there, as a part of its contract agreement. Attorneys representing the inmates used her reports during the trial to show that sometimes she has identified problems that, they said, were never fixed.</p>

<p>MTC, which paid for the private attorneys to defend the State, maintains that the facility is safe, secure and has improved under its management.</p>

<p>"The Southern Poverty Law Center has painted a completely unfair and inaccurate picture of the East Mississippi Correctional Facility. It is nothing like they've described," a statement from the corporation says. "The majority of the inmates who have been at the facility since 2012 would agree they've seen significant improvements in safety and security, quantity and quality of programs, respect, and overall conditions since MTC took over."</p>

<p>Videos created by MTC released during the trial show freshly painted walls and what appears to be a sterile facility. Inmates' testimony depicted different conditions inside, however, and complaints went far beyond missing doses of medication.</p>

<p>Assaults and Gangs</p>

<p>Barry Melton is serving a 40-year sentence for possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, but the military veteran did not commit a crime of violence. Instead, violence found Melton when he got to EMCF, he testified in federal court in March.</p>

<p>"I was tied up, beaten for about four hours ... and I was sexually assaulted," Melton said on March 14. He went on to describe being assaulted on July 24, 2016, by "several gang members," who thought he had taken drugs that belonged to them.</p>

<p>"They wanted to check inside me," Melton said. "... He stuck a large magic marker up my rear end to see if I had some drugs (they thought) I'd taken."</p>

<p>Melton bled for almost three months after the assault, even after trying to get medical attention. He saw a nurse on the day of the assault in July but would not see a doctor until September, he said in court. Since his assault, Melton was transferred to another MTC private prison, Wilkinson County Correctional Facility.</p>

<p>His testimony aligned with what other inmates who testified said about gang members running the facility. Warden Shaw would later call Melton a "chronic complainer," saying he tends to make up stories. Shaw also said the Gangster Disciples and Vice Lords have the most members in his facility and that the other gangs fall in line with those two groups. Major gangs such as the Simon City Royals and the Latin Kings are officially allied with those two gangs with members watching their allies' backs.</p>

<p>Shaw and his staff monitor "STG" or security threat groups, he testified, in order to ensure they equalize the numbers of members so they do not manipulate pods.</p>

<p>Gangs are in both public and private prisons in Mississippi. Earlier this year, MDOC and the Mississippi Department of Public Safety corrected the data contained in the state's 2017 gang threat assessment. As of December, about 32 percent, or 6,087 of the more than 19,000 inmates in MDOC custody, claim a gang affiliation. The Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators, a nonprofit made up of law enforcement officials and prosecutors, told The Clarion-Ledger last year that they estimate that 53 percent of verified gang members in the state are white. Black Mississippians make up nearly 62 percent of the inmate population behind bars, however, and only black gang members were prosecuted under the state's gang law from 2010 to 2017.</p>

<p>During the EMCF trial, MDOC's own court monitor, Thomas, would not testify in open court for fear of retribution from gang members. Videos shown in open court revealed inmate-on-inmate assaults with staff either on or off the zone, and in some instances not interfering with inmates at all. The majority of MTC staff are women; the inmate population at EMCF is all men.</p>

<p>Warden Shaw testified that it can be dangerous for his staff to interfere with inmates, especially when they manipulate and take off their handcuffs. Some inmates must wear restraints when they are considered a high security risk outside their cells.</p>

<p>"It can be very dangerous for staff to approach an inmate like that," Shaw said after Owens showed him one recorded incident where staff members stood by while an inmate ran up to another inmate's cell, kicked another inmate through the cell door and ran off.</p>

<p>Shaw has been the warden at Wilkinson County Correctional Facility during his time with MTC as well as at a facility in Arizona called Kingman. In July 2015, inmates rioted at that facility while Shaw was the complex administrator there. Inmates destroyed enough property that the Arizona Department of Corrections had to relocate more than 1,000 inmates.</p>

<p>"The targeted destruction of MTC property, together with the near absence of destruction of inmate personal property and the absence of inmate-on-inmate violence, strongly suggest that the riots were more likely precipitated by inmate dissatisfaction with MTC's operation of the prison than by anger among the inmates themselves," Arizona's Department of Corrections stated in a report.</p>

<p>MTC lost the contract to run Kingman after the riots, and Shaw returned to Mississippi to be warden at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility.</p>

<p>Cause of Death?</p>

<p>Attorneys representing inmates pointed to several inmate deaths as proof that those housed at EMCF are at risk of harm, but the warden maintained that violence and death are at every correctional facility.</p>

<p>"Every correctional facility that I've ever worked at has a different number of deaths. People unfortunately die in custody," Shaw said when Owens cross-examined him April.</p>

<p>"And as people unfortunately die in custody, having four deaths in three months, is that a high number for you?" Owens asked of the deaths at the East Mississippi facility so far in 2018.</p>

<p>"I don't define it as a high number. It's an unfortunate number," Shaw responded. Hill, the inmate who trembled throughout his testimony, testified seeing a man choke to death in the hallway in January.</p>

<p>Rogelio Solis/AP</p>

<p>Another inmate died during the course of the trial in the hospital bringing the death count at EMCF to five this year, Owens said after the trial.</p>

<p>Defense attorneys, technically defending the state in the case, relied on two narratives when it came to inmate harm. First, they argued that the inmates themselves cause a lot of violence and self-harm. When attorneys representing the plaintiffs brought up contraband, weapons and self-harm, often the defense's response was to point to an inmate who tore down the light fixture to make the contraband weapon or clog his toilet by trying to flush items down it.</p>

<p>Lawyers representing the State of Mississippi also said a lot of the plaintiffs' claims were common in other prisons around the state and country.</p>

<p>"When you have 1,200 men who are hardened criminals ... murderers, rapists ... living in close proximity, you're going to have fights," W. Thomas Siler, an attorney defending the State of Mississippi, told Judge Barbour in his closing argument.</p>

<p>The State called Ken McGinnis, a former warden in Illinois who now consults on corrections, as a witness to analyze the rates of assaults in the facility. Using data MTC provided, McGinnis concluded that the rates of assault were not significant.</p>

<p>"And the problem with most of these units, the numbers are so small that statistically it's basically irrelevant, but it gives you some indication of what's going on and where the majority of incidents were occurring with assaults," McGinnis testified. "And not surprising, at least to me, the majority of those were going on in the mental-health area and in segregation."</p>

<p>"Segregation" refers to inmates who are kept in single-unit cells, separate from other inmates and isolated from other parts of the facility.</p>

<p>Attorneys for the inmates argued that McGinnis' numbers were not correct, finding a few reports not included on his list. SPLC counted 160 assaults in 2016 and 99 assaults in the first six months of 2017.</p>

<p>'Not Going to Do It'</p>

<p>Ultimately, a lot of problems at EMCF appear to boil down to staffing levels, testimony revealed. When the state contracted with MTC to run EMCF in 2012, the State sought to cut costs by using a private vendor to operate the facility.</p>

<p>The original contract signed in 2012, on the state's public contract portal, shows that the state only pays $26.24 per minimum-security inmate; $31.19 per medium-security inmate; and $71.11 per single-cell security inmate every day.</p>

<p>At the time, these costs were cheaper than what MDOC was paying to house its own prisoners. Since the initial contract was signed, Commissioner Pelicia Hall has renegotiated the MTC contracts she told lawmakers at the Capitol in April.</p>

<p>"We pay a per diem of about $41.74 in our private facilities because they have to by law operate those facilities at a rate of at least 10 percent less than the Department of Corrections, so they have some blended rates," she said at the Capitol April 23.</p>

<p>However, the bond indebtedness the state incurred on its private prisons is enormous. Mississippi still owes more than $81 million for building EMCF alone, which the State will not pay off until 2023. The State's bond debt totals nearly $218 million on the three operating private prisons and Walnut Grove, which shuttered in 2017—bonds taxpayers will be on the hook for through 2027, MDOC numbers show.</p>

<p>MTC paid for private attorneys to defend the State in the federal lawsuit, because Mississippi law creates immunity for the State in the case.</p>

<p>When MTC came to run the facility in 2012, even defense attorneys admitted the facility was a "bleak place." MDOC and MTC negotiated staffing levels at the time—and then renegotiated them in 2014. The state is paying MTC more than $92 million to run EMCF through July 2022, according to the contract, which was modified in 2017 and is now available for viewing on the Transparency Mississippi.</p>

<p>During the trial, MTC and MDOC employees testified that current correctional officers and medical staff levels cost more than the currently required contract obligation. In other words, both MTC and Centurion are paying some staff with their own money, not the State of Mississippi's money.</p>

<p>Gloria Perry, MDOC's chief medical officer who is a named defendant in the lawsuit, testified that EMCF is still looking for a chief psychiatrist. Perry testified that although Centurion proposed about 60 full-time medical-care employees for the facility in 2016, MDOC proposed to cut that to 43.</p>

<p>"What was the reasoning to do that ... to save money?" Judge Barbour asked her.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. We were under constraints from the (state) contract review board," Perry said.</p>

<p>Barbour asked about the funding that the Legislature cut from MDOC's budget, which might have led to cuts in staff.</p>

<p>"We use the same contract (that requires 43 medical personnel). Centurion added more staff, but they've done it at their expense—the state of Mississippi is not paying for that," Perry testified.</p>

<p>Centurion currently has 52 medical personnel employee openings, and 48 of those are occupied, Monju confirmed during questioning at trial. Centurion is paying for the employees above the 43-employee mark, Perry said.</p>

<p>"They felt that additional staff was necessary," Perry said.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs' attorneys pointed out that Centurion could drop personnel levels back down to 43 employees at any time, due to how the contract is written. Centene provides medical services in all of MDOC prisons, private and public. The most recent contract between MDOC and Centurion runs from July 2016 to June 2019 and is valued at nearly $150 million. It is posted on the Transparency Mississippi website.</p>

<p>MTC also staffs EMCF at higher levels than its contract with MDOC requires. Warden Shaw testified that he has 177 correctional officers on staff at EMCF. He has approved adding officers during his time at the prison. The MTC-MDOC contract only requires 136 officers, however.</p>

<p>"Could you go back to 136?" Owens asked Shaw during trial.</p>

<p>"Not going to do it," Shaw said.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs' attorneys maintained that there is nothing contractually stopping MTC from dropping back to what even their organizations have deemed—by their actions at least—too low of staffing levels at EMCF. Recruitment, especially for mental-health care workers, is a statewide struggle that Judge Barbour alluded to during closing arguments.</p>

<p>"Where does the State of Mississippi find enough state psychiatrists to come to a rural area?" Barbour asked SPLC attorney Elissa Johnson during closing arguments.</p>

<p>Johnson maintained that MDOC has decided to send inmates with mental-care needs to EMCF and that the State enjoys no constitutional exception.</p>

<p>"The Mississippi Department of Corrections has demonstrated deliberate indifference," Johnson said. "... The Commissioner has been aware of these issues since she's been in office."</p>

<p>Martin Horn, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said that private prison contractors will usually do what a state asks them to do—but this is spelled out in the contract.</p>

<p>"I would say typically when we see poor performance in private prisons, the fault is perhaps more with the contracting state or municipality than it is with the private operator," Horn told the Jackson Free Press. "... (Perhaps) the state is trying to do this on the cheap."</p>

<p>Where is the 'Dividing Line'?</p>

<p>Judge Barbour certified the inmates' case as a class-action lawsuit back in 2015.</p>

<p>But after several failed settlement agreements, the case went to trial this spring. Defense attorneys consistently relied on the claim that the prison had improved significantly since MTC took over in 2012.</p>

<p>Barbour, a Ronald Reagan appointee who is a cousin to former Gov. Haley Barbour, seemed intent on moving the trial along whenever he could. By the third week, Barbour vocalized his irritation with the plaintiffs' attorneys.</p>

<p>At one point, ACLU attorney Eric Balaban was questioning Bruce Gage, a psychiatrist and expert witness in the case. Gage described the risks of inmates being isolated in segregation unit.</p>

<p>"Did you find anything that was done right with medical at EMCF?" Judge Barbour asked Gage.</p>

<p>"Prescribers were a bright spot," he said, noting that the medical staff at EMCF seemed to be giving inmates what he viewed to be the proper medications for their conditions in most instances.</p>

<p>Balaban continued to question Gage, but Barbour seemed irked. He grew impatient with the style of questioning. When Balaban asked to show a video, the judge refused to see another one. He told him to move along with his testimony, but when Balaban returned to his prepared questions for Gage, Barbour cut him off.</p>

<p>"Why can't you change so you don't irritate the judge?" he asked. "... The mental health is not good. You don't have to prove every mental-health problem in this prison." Barbour cut Balaban's questioning off and ended court 10 minutes before he normally did, telling the plaintiffs to shorten their testimony in the coming week.</p>

<p>Judge Barbour toured the prison facility after the plaintiffs' attorneys concluded their arguments and before the defense's rebuttal. Attorneys for both the defense and the plaintiffs, along with the warden, toured the facility before Easter weekend. EMCF was in the midst of an audit from the American Correctional Association at the time of the visit.</p>

<p>"My observation from the tour of the prison was it was pretty well spit-shined. Unit 5 (the segregation unit) had been repainted and appeared to be clean," Barbour said. "... Should I take that with a grain of salt with plaintiffs noting that ACA came in three days before?"</p>

<p>Rogelio Solis/AP</p>

<p>Siler said the facility is in good condition and could not recall it looking any different. The State requires ACA to certify all its private prisons and to audit the facilities every three years. EMCF passed its past ACA inspection and is compliant with the Prison Rape Elimination Act.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Barbour was looking for what he called the "dividing line." He asked Johnson and Monju repeatedly where the line was when it came to what level of mental and medical health care is needed for inmates or what rate of assaults is commonplace in other prison facilities.</p>

<p>"Don't assaults happen at every prison handling mental-health inmates?" he asked Johnson during closing arguments.</p>

<p>Neither party seemed to budge on their views that the prison was in bad shape or just fine.</p>

<p>"I can't get the plaintiffs to say anything good, and I can't get the defendants to say anything is wrong," Barbour said.</p>

<p>Beyond the dividing line, Barbour was also looking for a potential solution. He repeatedly asked Johnson and Monju, "What do you want me to do?"</p>

<p>Technically, the complaint asks the court to rule on seven specific grievances, deeming the treatment of prisoners unconstitutional. It also asks the judge to order MDOC to develop a plan to address the "substantial risks of serious harm" to inmates in the facility, and for the defense to pay their attorneys' fees.</p>

<p>During closing arguments, Monju and Johnson said the judge could order a staffing analysis at the facility or mandate that MDOC create an oversight system or appoint a monitor to the prison.</p>

<p>None of these remedies is listed in their complaint, however.</p>

<p>Owens and Johnson said their requests for relief are broad solutions because there are several different approaches to remedies.</p>

<p>Ron Welch, a retired Mississippi prison litigation attorney, says in most of the major prison cases where a judge takes action, he or she will appoint a court monitor to come in and inspect the prison regularly for progress, depending on what conditions need to change.</p>

<p>"I think if you have a neutral third party, the judge can appoint an expert to go in and look and report every quarter, at a minimum," Welch said in an interview.</p>

<p>Welch explained that sometimes judges will order attorneys to submit proposed findings of fact and then issue an order based on those briefs.</p>

<p>But Barbour would not even let plaintiffs' attorneys argue for post-trial briefing. Instead, he asked each side for a list of cases they referenced in closing arguments. Judge Barbour could also direct the legal teams for both parties to come up with an agreement to remedy any grievance he finds to be unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Barbour will have to decide if any of the seven claims amounts to "cruel and unusual punishments" defined in the Eighth Amendment. If the judge believes some of the inmates' claims are credible, he will have to decide how to hold MDOC responsible for its contracts that have led to conditions at EMCF.</p>

<p>"This is the problem with private prisons," Welch said. "How the hell do you enforce it when they screw up?"</p>

<p>Future of Private Prisons</p>

<p>After the State passed a massive criminal-justice reform package in 2014, the number of incarcerated Mississippians dropped, leading to less of a need for private prisons. Or at least, that is what MDOC claimed when it closed Walnut Grove Correctional Facility, which was at the heart of a 2010 federal lawsuit and a U.S. Department of Justice investigation in 2006 for its maltreatment of youth who were previously housed in the facility until they were old enough to transfer to adult prisons.</p>

<p>In 2010, the ACLU Prison Project and SPLC sued the Walnut Grove Correctional Facility over conditions and won a consent decree for the facility. Inmates in that case testified about riots, violence and staff members smuggling contraband inside the prison. Similar to the EMCF case today, MTC had taken over the contract at Walnut Grove and alleged that conditions had greatly improved.</p>

<p>In 2015, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves kept the facility under the consent decree. A year later, MDOC closed the prison permanently.</p>

<p>"MDOC's budget is lower than what we anticipated," then-Commissioner Marshall Fisher said in a press release in 2016. "Pursuant to an intensive budget review and evaluation, we have determined this is the most prudent action. We have the space in our state-run prisons to house the 900 inmates at Walnut Grove."</p>

<p>Former MDOC Commissioner Chris Epps signed all of the initial private-prison contracts with MTC. Epps was the epicenter of a massive bribery scandal, which landed him and Carl Reddix of Health Assurance LLC, which previously provided health care at EMCF, in federal prison.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jim Hood filed 11 racketeering civil lawsuits in response to the Epps scandal in 2017, including against MTC and Health Assurance LLC, for conspiring with Epps in the bribes. Neither of those claims has been settled.</p>

<p>The civil suit against MTC accuses the corporation of contracting with former Rep. Cecil McCrory of Rankin County to lobby on their behalf in order to secure a contract with Epps.</p>

<p>"MTC and McCrory pursued a common plan and course of conduct, acted in concert with, aided and abetted and otherwise conspired with one another, in furtherance of their common scheme to defraud the State," the suit says.</p>

<p>"MTC knew, or should have known, that the 'consulting fees' it was paying Defendant McCrory were being used to pay bribes and kickbacks to assure that Defendant Epps would award public contracts, paid for by the State, to MTC."</p>

<p>Both Epps and McCrory are in federal prison; Epps is housed in Texas, and McCrory is in Alabama. MTC maintains that it was not aware of the bribery scheme.</p>

<p>"MTC hired McCrory as a lobbyist to communicate with state leaders about the progress we were making in the Mississippi prisons we operated," a statement from the corporation says.</p>

<p>"We had no idea he was sharing what we paid to him with Chris Epps. We terminated his contract immediately when we heard the reports."</p>

<p>While Mississippi taxpayers owe millions of dollars for private-prison bonds, they did not have to pay to defend the state in the EMCF trial. State law says that "the contractor shall defend any suit or claim brought against the State of Mississippi arising out of any act or omission in the operation of a private facility, and shall hold the State of Mississippi harmless."</p>

<p>MTC would not release the cost of litigation attached to paying for private attorneys to the defend the State for the last month. Whether or not Mississippi needs private prisons to house its population of around 19,000 inmates is also at the heart of this case.</p>

<p>On April 9, the sun lit up the federal courthouse on the day of closing arguments, and a few pastors gathered to pray on the steps. CJ Rhodes, the president of Clergy for Prison Reform, said his group formed in 2015 during the Walnut Grove trial. His group wants to reduce and eventually eradicate any private-prison contracts in Mississippi.</p>

<p>"I'm not convinced that if you have a profit motivation, you're concerned about making prisons humane," Rhodes said outside the courthouse.</p>

<p>" ... The criminal justice system (should be) about rehabilitation."</p>

<p>Rhodes said his understanding of the gospels in the Bible lead him to believe that all people have an opportunity for redemption. He hopes Judge Barbour is not "soft" on the prison in his ruling.</p>

<p>Barbour said he will issue a written opinion. He did not allow plaintiffs' attorneys to petition for post-trial briefing. He adjourned court before noon on Monday, April 9, as he crumbled up several pieces of paper sitting in front of him, clearly ready for a vacation.</p>

<p>Rep. Jay Hughes of Oxford said the state needs to improve public education, highways and mental health services. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — First-term Democratic state Rep. Jay Hughes of Oxford announced last week that he is running for Mississippi lieutenant governor in 2019, saying the state needs to improve public education, highways and mental health services and create a lottery.</p>

<p>Hughes , 54, said current state leaders are not squarely facing the state's challenges.</p>

<p>"I believe that commonsense problem solving is what we need a lot more of, instead of spin and political posturing," Hughes told a few dozen people during a campaign kickoff at a Jackson hotel.</p>

<p>"Mississippi problems are not miraculously cured and fixed by ignoring them.... The first step in solving a problem is admitting there is one," he said. "And I'm tired of hearing career politicians in Mississippi claim that everything — everything — is great for jobs, economy, food on the table, college students not really leaving, roads and bridges are fine. They aren't."</p>

<p>Hughes is the first candidate to announce for what will be an open seat. Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves is limited to two terms and is preparing to run for governor.</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor presides over the state Senate and has considerable influence over which bills become law.</p>

<p>Republican Delbert Hosemann, the third-term secretary of state, is widely considered another possible candidate for lieutenant governor.</p>

<p>Republicans hold seven of eight statewide offices in Mississippi. The last person elected lieutenant governor as a Democrat was Amy Tuck, in 1999. She switched to the Republican Party in late 2002 and won a second term the next year.</p>

<p>Hughes is an attorney and developer and served as an Oxford alderman before winning a House seat in 2015. He's also a U.S. Army veteran.</p>

<p>During the campaign kickoff, he spoke about growing up poor in south Louisiana and east Texas. He said his biggest influence was the grandfather he called Poose, who hand-dug sewer ditches for a city water department and taught him to work hard.</p>

<p>"I didn't get my values from some national political party or a cable news program," said Hughes, who was joined on stage by his wife, Cris, and their daughter, Patricia. "I got them from my parents and grandparents at home, at church and at the school of hard knocks."</p>

<p>Democratic former Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove said after the event that he is backing Hughes because he believes Hughes has joined Democratic Sen. Hob Bryan of Amory as one of the most vocal supporters of public schools.</p>

<p>"Jay Hughes has been a consistent voice for improving and investing in education," said Musgrove, who served two terms in the state Senate and one as lieutenant governor before serving as governor from 2000 to 2004.</p>

<p>Answering questions after his speech, Hughes said he used to consider himself a Republican and has long voted based on which candidate he prefers, not a party label. He said he doesn't know when he started considering himself a Democrat, but he has been elected to both offices under that label.</p>

<p>Hughes has been a frequent critic of Republican leaders in the Mississippi House and is known for frequent social media posts giving his own ideas about education funding and other issues.</p>

<p>State GOP chairman Lucien Smith said in a statement: "Jay Hughes is an Oxford liberal best known at the Capitol for not supporting gun rights, running from legislation to protect the unborn, and generally achieving nothing except getting his name in the papers. Mississippi voters should reject him just as they've rejected other liberals like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama."</p>

<p>In 2016, Hughes sued Republican House Speaker Philip Gunn for using a computer-generated voice to read bills aloud in the House chamber. Reading aloud is a common filibuster tactic used by opponents to issues being debated, and House Democrats forced readings in March 2016 because they thought their ideas were being ignored by the Republican supermajority.</p>

<p>Hughes said in the lawsuit that Gunn had violated the Mississippi Constitution by setting the machine to read so quickly that the bills could not be understood. Hughes also said lawmakers were calling it a "demon chipmunk" voice. The state Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that it has no power to settle a dispute over how the Legislature operates.</p>

<h2 id="sheriffsdecrycutbacksprivateprisoncontracts">Sheriffs Decry Cutbacks, Private Prison Contracts</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>MDOC Commissioner Pelicia Hall defended her decision to pull inmates out of regional facilities due to budget constraints at the Capitol on Monday, where sheriffs had gathered to tell lawmakers they were going to be in funding danger. Photo by File Photo/MDOC</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi sheriffs packed into Room 113 at the Capitol Monday to express frustrations after the Mississippi Department of Corrections announced a reduction in inmates housed at the 15 regional facilities in the state even as taxpayer money is going to fund private, corporate-operated prisons.</p>

<p>MDOC Commissioner Pelicia Hall said she had no choice fiscally but to pull inmates out of regional facilities. MDOC had budget problems at the start of 2018 and asked the Legislature to help fund its budget deficit. The Legislature came up with $7 million to fund MDOC's request for the state's private-prison bond obligations and medical costs for inmates—but stopped short of providing the $3.6 million deficit the department requested for the regional correctional facilities.</p>

<p>Even House Corrections Committee Chairman Bill Kinkade, R-Byhalia, admitted the challenges in corrections funding on Monday.</p>

<p>"The fact is we have funding issues in corrections. That's not a revelation to anybody," he said. "There have been some deficit-spending issues, and all of them haven't been addressed."</p>

<p>MDOC currently houses medium- and low-custody inmates at the 15 regional facilities, run by 22 counties and local sheriff departments in the state. The counties own these regional facilities, and MDOC pays the counties at a range from $20 to $29.74 per inmate per day, depending on the county's bond indebtedness. Counties and sheriffs use these funds to help pay off bonds or balance their budgets.</p>

<p>If the department removes inmates from regional jails, local counties and sheriffs' departments will receive less funding than they do currently from MDOC to house state inmates.</p>

<p>William Allen, an attorney who represents the Mississippi Sheriffs' Association, pointed out that the State initially asked the counties to build the regional facilities back in the late 1990s and early 2000s to house the ballooning state prison population. The State also contracted with private-prison contractors to operate facilities they built during this time. Fast forward two decades, however, and Mississippi passed substantial criminal-justice reform measures in 2014 that led to a drop in inmate population statewide, lessening the need for cells. MDOC closed the Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in 2016, citing budget reasons and less need for space.</p>

<p>"We're struggling financially; we're struggling to keep the lights on in these facilities," Allen told lawmakers on Monday.</p>

<p>Allen and sheriffs questioned the State maintaining contracts with private prison corporations when they are cutting funding to regional and local jailers at the same time. Some sheriffs testified about being unable to repair their buildings or keep prison guards employed without funding for adequate salaries.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the regional jails weren't funded while the private prisons were. The private facilities have been funded, and you may have seen one of these facilities in the news lately," Allen said referring to the class-action lawsuit against the East Mississippi Correctional Facility in Meridian brought by prisoners for lack of treatment and bad conditions.</p>

<p>Commissioner Hall is in a tough spot, however. The State contracts with the Management and Training Corporation to run the three operational private prisons; those contracts were signed before her tenure began. Those agreements require certain inmate population levels and payment guarantees.</p>

<p>"There's a prison-population guarantee that the State is required to have with those facilities," Hall told lawmakers on Monday. "... And to remove those potential inmates, the State would have to basically renegotiate or re-do those particular contracts whereby we're not obligated to fill those beds."</p>

<p>Additionally, Hall said that the private prisons house medium- to high-security level inmates, as well as inmates with special mental-health needs like at EMCF, while the regional facilities house state inmates considered to be low- or medium-custody. With the Legislature's criminal-justice reforms, Hall said the dynamics of the prison system will change over time.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, the low-level offenders are not going to be the ones spending those long sentences in the county jails, and that's just the nature of the beast that comes with criminal-justice reform," she said. "I think in this state we built too many prisons, and we were over-incarcerating at some point. Well, the trend has turned."</p>

<p>MDOC pays about $41.74 per inmate per day in a private prison, Hall said. At the Capitol on Monday, she said that the contract for Wilkinson County Correctional Facility is up for renewal in June this year, and she is having her staff prepare a request-for-proposal for contractors to bid on. She said she is also considering bringing the operations there back in-house.</p>

<p>The State still owes more than $217 million in bond indebtedness on private prisons, and taxpayers will pay for those bonds, including for the closed Walnut Grove, until 2027, MDOC numbers show.</p>

<p>These bond costs are in addition to the State's contractual obligations to MTC to operate the facilities and to other contractors such as Centene Corporation to provide medical care in the state's prison system.</p>

<p>County taxpayers in the 22 counties that issued bonds to open regional prisons will have to foot the bill for those facilities, however, which is why the room was tense on Monday. There are about 3,000 inmates in the state's three private prisons, while regional facilities house more than 4,000 inmates.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, it comes down to funding, and just like you all have needs and issues in your regional facilities, we have them in the Department of Corrections, too," Hall said.</p>

<h2 id="travelbancaseisjusticesfirstdiveintotrumppolicy">Travel Ban Case is Justices' First Dive into Trump Policy</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-23</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/apr/23/travel-ban-case-justices-first-dive-trump-policy/ </p>

<p>The Supreme Court justices' first deep dive into a Trump administration policy comes in a dispute over the third and latest version of the administration's ban on travel from some countries with majority Muslim populations. Photo by Flickr/NCinDC</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court has so far had little to say about Donald Trump's time as president, even as the nation has moved from one Trump controversy to another. That's about to change.</p>

<p>The justices' first deep dive into a Trump administration policy comes in a dispute over the third and latest version of the administration's ban on travel from some countries with majority Muslim populations. Opponents of the policy and some lower courts have labeled it a "Muslim ban," harking back to Trump's campaign call to keep Muslims from entering the country.</p>

<p>The high-stakes arguments at the high court on Wednesday could offer some indication about how a court that runs on respect for traditions and precedent will deal with a president who regularly breaks with convention.</p>

<p>Apart from the campaign statements, Trump's presidential tweets about the travel ban and last fall's retweets of inflammatory videos that stoked anti-Islam sentiment all could feature in the court's discussion of the travel ban's legality.</p>

<p>"The court could get to the right outcome without getting into the question of his tweets. But I think the president set it up so that it's virtually impossible to ignore him when he's shouting from the rooftops about what his purpose was in the three versions of the ban," said Cecillia Wang, the American Civil Liberties Union's deputy legal director.</p>

<p>Solicitor General Noel Francisco, who will argue the administration's case, said in a court filing that the ban is well within the president's authority and is not based on prejudice against Islam.</p>

<p>In a sign of heightened public interest, the court is taking the rare step of making an audio recording of the proceedings available just hours after the arguments end.</p>

<p>One key issue will be how the court evaluates administration actions.</p>

<p>Neil Eggleston, President Barack Obama's last White House counsel, suggested in an online forum last week that Trump does not merit the same measure of latitude that courts usually give presidents, especially in the areas of national security and immigration.</p>

<p>"The court will have to wrestle with how much to defer to a President who has created this record of chaos and animus," Eggleston and co-author Amanda Elbogen wrote on justsecurity.org.</p>

<p>Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, cautioned that the court would be breaking new ground if it were to treat Trump differently from other presidents.</p>

<p>The policy under review at the court applies to travelers from five countries with overwhelmingly Muslim populations — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. It also affects two non-Muslim countries: blocking travelers from North Korea and some Venezuelan government officials and their families. A sixth majority Muslim country, Chad, was removed from the list this month after improving "its identity-management and information sharing practices," Trump said in a proclamation.</p>

<p>Francisco said the Chad decision shows that the restrictions are premised only on national security concerns. He also said that the State Department has cleared more than 430 visa applicants from the affected countries for waivers that would allow them to enter the U.S.</p>

<p>But the challengers argue that the administration cannot ask the court to ignore all that has happened.</p>

<p>Trump's first travel ban was issued just a week after he took office in January 2017, and was aimed at seven countries. It triggered chaos and protests across the U.S. as travelers were stopped from boarding international flights and detained at airports for hours. Trump tweaked the order after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco refused to reinstate the ban.</p>

<p>The next version, announced in March 2017, dropped Iraq from the list of covered countries and made it clear the 90-day ban covering Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen didn't apply to those travelers who already had visas. It also eliminated language that would give priority to religious minorities. Critics said the changes didn't erase the ban's legal problems.</p>

<p>The 9th Circuit and the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, agreed with the ban's opponents. The 4th Circuit said the ban "drips with religious intolerance, animus and discrimination." The 9th Circuit ruled that Trump violated immigration law.</p>

<p>The third version is indefinite, unlike the other two, and the administration said it is the product of a thorough review of how other countries screen their own citizens and share information with the U.S.</p>

<p>It fared no better than its predecessors in the lower courts, but the Supreme Court said in an unsigned order in December that it could take full effect while the legal dispute continues. The justices said nothing about the substance of the policy, either in December or in earlier actions involving the ban.</p>

<p>Now, though, they are confronted with the administration's view that Trump has broad discretion to impose limits on immigration and that the courts don't even have a role to play. The Justice Department has said throughout the course of the legal fight that the lawsuits challenging the policy should be dismissed without ever reaching the challengers' claims. The administration says that foreigners have no right to enter the United States and no right to challenge their exclusion in American courts.</p>

<p>Supporting briefs for the ban's challengers dwarf filings on the administration's side. Retired high-ranking military officers, former Republican officeholders, Catholic bishops, Amazon, Facebook and 113 other companies, the children of Japanese-Americans who were held in internment camps during World War II and more than a dozen mainly Democratic-led states are among those calling on the court to strike down the Trump policy.</p>

<p>The administration's supporters include roughly the same number of Republican-led states, as well as conservative groups and Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's personal lawyers.</p>

<p>A decision in Trump v. Hawaii, 17-965, is expected by late June.</p>

<p>Panelists discussed childhood trauma, re-entry and mental health at the City of Jackson's Crime and Justice Summit at the Jackson Convention Center on April 19, 2018. The panelists were, from left to right, Larry Perry, Devon Loggins, Tiffany Anderson Washington, Fallon Brewster and Etta Morgan. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — A panel of Mississippi-based professionals sat in black leather armchairs on the stage of the Jackson Convention Center's theater on April 19. Larry Perry, Devon Loggins, Tiffany Anderson-Washington, Fallon Brewster and Etta Morgan were there to lead a panel discussion for the City of Jackson's Crime and Justice Summit.</p>

<p>The conversation went in several directions, but at the core, the panelists and the audience addressed childhood trauma, re-entry services and how to better support victims of crime.</p>

<p>But, some pivotal and controversial crime issues in Jackson were left off the table for the most part, such as officer-involved shootings and Project EJECT, although U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst had come to the summit with his two youngest daughters in tow. He left before the conversation got started, however. He is leading Project EJECT in the capital city under the direction of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, working with the Jackson Police Department and other agencies.</p>

<p>Some members of the Jackson Police Department briefed the room on this year's crime stats as well as the Interim Chief of Police Anthony Moore's hopes for Jackson in the near future: new police cars, a larger police force and community-oriented policing.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>"I just want to say that I'm a strong advocate of community policing. It's my goal as chief and for the officers of this department to have a strong partnership with the community and a strong commitment," Moore said.</p>

<p>Then Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba took the microphone, speaking of his brother who is 16 years his senior, who was shot in the head in Jackson in the early 1990s but survived. Referring to himself as a "recovering attorney," the mayor also spoke from the familial perspective, saying he wants a fruitful, honest, productive conversation about the criminal-justice system.</p>

<p>Of Stigma and Trauma</p>

<p>Etta Morgan, a professor of sociology and criminal justice at Jackson State University, served as the moderator. She prefaced the panel's dialogue with a message about stigma.</p>

<p>"I tell my students that you want to talk about a convict as long as it's not in your family," she said. "When it's in your family, you say 'my cousin made a mistake.' Your cousin is also a convict. So don't try to ostracize the person down the street and you have family members with the same issue. We need to embrace and retool those persons in the community."</p>

<p>Devon Loggins, president and CEO of Methodist Children's Homes of Mississippi; Larry Perry, president and CEO of New Way Mississippi, which does reentry work in Jackson; Tiffany Anderson Washington, coordinator of mobile crisis response at Hinds Behavioral Health Services, and Fallon Brewster, Jackson Medical Mall Foundation's VP of marketing and communications joined Morgan on stage.</p>

<p>Loggins, who used to work in prisons, focused on youth trauma. He said that he found that many of the incarcerated people over 18 he worked with had identical backgrounds of trauma as the kids in the Methodist Children's Homes.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to get you to make the connection between childhood trauma, those experiences that kids have no control over whatsoever, abuses that have been perpetrated against them. They're hungry, they don't have anyone," Loggins said.</p>

<p>He added that the anger and poor decisions can result from traumatic events during childhood, such as witnessing or being a victim of violence, which can cause a person to act out or become violent and caught up with law enforcement, Loggins said.</p>

<p>Brewster, who grew up in Georgetown, put the onus on communities having each other's backs, especially when people shy away from therapy.</p>

<p>"When communities feel empowered, and they know each other, and they have those relationships with each other— there's a lot of counseling that can go on amongst the community," she said. "What I've learned was just knowing your neighbors and just understanding what they're going through, you may not be as comfortable going to a counselor, but you can talk to your neighbor...."</p>

<p>Perry, who does re-entry work in Jackson, said the perception of crime in Jackson can be worse than the actual crimes taking place, and that people here spend a lot of time talking about the problem and complaining rather than focusing on solutions.</p>

<p>JPD Assistant Chief James Davis said that he wanted more of the resources on hand that Perry offers because he has had people come to the police department after getting out of prison, asking for things to do so that they will not return there.</p>

<p>"Everybody (doesn't) want to go back to prison, so we have to have that avenue where we can direct them," Davis said to the room.</p>

<p>Needed: Better Police Treatment and Protocol</p>

<p>Then came community voices asking for better treatment and protocol by law enforcement.</p>

<p>Lucinda Wade-Robinson asserted herself to get a chance to speak—she said she had been skipped over as she sat at least eight rows back from the stage. Her son was murdered in Jackson in front of their house as she and other family members sat inside in 2014. She said she and her family were treated horribly by officials, from the police investigator to the Mississippi attorney general's office.</p>

<p>"We were not treated like victims, we were treated like criminals, and the young men that did this, they were treated like they were the victims," Wade-Robinson told the room.</p>

<p>Wade-Robinson said the only person from the City who had reached out to her was Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps, leading Mayor Lumumba to interject that it was before his time in office.</p>

<p>The mother who lost her son said she did not want to bash law enforcement, whom she appreciates and even prays for, but that she wants better treatment for the families of victims in the future. She implored the mayor to reach out to the victims of violent crimes as they learn to cope with a lifetime of grief.</p>

<p>"You learn to deal with it but it does not get better—it has not gotten better for me," Wade-Robinson said. "I miss my son more and more every day, and it has not gotten better. And he was murdered over a vehicle ... people mean more than things. He was murdered over a raggedy piece of junk. It was a car that was not running."</p>

<p>"...I feel that things are going to change now that we're under a new mayor. I commend him for what he has done so far," she added.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi sheriffs packed into Room 113 at the Capitol Monday to express frustrations after the Mississippi Department of Corrections announced a reduction in inmates housed at the 15 regional facilities in the state even as taxpayer money is going to fund private, corporate-operated prisons.</p>

"I think in this state we built too many prisons, and we were over-incarcerating at some point. Well, the trend has turned."</p>

<p>MDOC pays about $41.74 per inmate per day in a private prison, Hall said. At the Capitol on Monday, she said that the contract for Wilkinson County Correctional Facility is up for renewal in June this year, and she is having her staff prepare a request-for-proposal for contractors to bid on. She said she is also considering bringing the operations there back in-house.</p>

<p>The State still owes more than $217 million in bond indebtedness on private prisons, and taxpayers will pay for those bonds, including for the closed Walnut Grove, until 2027, MDOC numbers show.</p>

<p>These bond costs are in addition to the State's contractual obligations to MTC to operate the facilities and to other contractors such as Centene Corporation to provide medical care in the state's prison system.</p>

<p>County taxpayers in the 22 counties that issued bonds to open regional prisons will have to foot the bill for those facilities, however, which is why the room was tense on Monday. There are about 3,000 inmates in the state's three private prisons, while regional facilities house more than 4,000 inmates.</p>

<p>"Ultimately, it comes down to funding, and just like you all have needs and issues in your regional facilities, we have them in the Department of Corrections, too," Hall said.</p>

<p>A recent survey of Mississippi jails conducted by the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law shows that 2,500 defendants—more than one-third of all of those jailed before trial—have been in jail 90 or more consecutive days.

<p>BRANDON, Miss. (AP) — Jerry Sanders has been sitting in a jail cell on a relatively minor charge of methamphetamine possession for more than a year—longer than the sentence he could get if he's convicted.</p>

<p>And with no money to post bail or hire his own lawyer, he may be sitting there for weeks or months more.</p>

<p>"I miss my children, I miss my woman, I miss my dog, I miss my job, I miss my home — everything," Sanders, 58, said recently by videoconference from inside the Rankin County jail in Brandon.</p>

<p>Long pretrial detentions are not unheard of elsewhere in the United States. But poverty, scarce resources, and a pattern of locking up people for low-level crimes make them particularly prevalent here, in the country's poorest state.</p>

<p>A recent survey of Mississippi jails conducted by the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law—released exclusively to The Associated Press—shows that 2,500 defendants—more than one-third of all of those jailed before trial—have been in jail 90 or more consecutive days. More than 600 have been in jail longer than a year.</p>

<p>The most recent census conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2013, showed an average pretrial jail stay in Mississippi of 40 days, the sixth-longest in the country. The census also revealed that Mississippi had the second-highest number of local jail inmates per capita, behind Louisiana.</p>

<p>Cliff Johnson, who directs the Ole Miss branch of Chicago-based MacArthur, said he hopes the information will show the true extent of long pretrial jail stays in Mississippi and bolster efforts to lessen them. MacArthur has repeatedly sued cities and counties in Mississippi for jailing poor people who can't afford to pay bail or fines.</p>

<p>Data was nearly impossible to compile until last July, when the state Supreme Court, lobbied by the MacArthur center, ordered sheriff's offices to provide it.</p>

<p>The numbers reinforce what Johnson says he already knew: "Mississippi's criminal justice system, for a variety of reasons, is set up so that lengthy pretrial incarceration is not only possible, it's common."</p>

<p>Among those reasons:</p>

<p>— Most defendants in Mississippi can't afford their own lawyers or the high bails judges continue to slap on them, despite decades-old federal court rulings that they consider what a defendant can pay.</p>

<p>"They've been convicted of nothing," Johnson said. "They're presumed innocent, and I think we lose sight of that fact."</p>

<p>— Public defenders in Mississippi are overworked and underpaid. Attorneys may spend five minutes with a defendant while a judge sets bail, but defendants may not see lawyers again until after they've been indicted. A recent report slamming indigent defense called this period the "black hole" of representation. Judicial leaders plan to ask lawmakers for more funding to increase the amount of help available to poor defendants.</p>

<p>— In many rural Mississippi counties, grand juries and courts meet only twice a year. In 2012, a woman in Choctaw County was jailed for more than three months without a preliminary hearing because the court was out of session.</p>

<p>On the same day The Associated Press interviewed him, Mark Chandlee, a part-time public defender in Lauderdale County, was handling an armed-robbery plea in which the defendant had been jailed just a few months shy of two years.</p>

<p>"I don't really have much standing to get the case rolling until they're indicted," Chandlee said.</p>

<p>In January, records show, a Lauderdale County man pleaded guilty to disposing stolen property. His sentence carried no prison time, but he'd already been in jail 310 days.</p>

<p>Such long jail stays pressure people into pleading guilty, public defenders say.</p>

<p>"Spending time in a county jail, it can make guys crack," said Marvell Gordon, a public defender in Lauderdale and Yazoo counties.</p>

<p>Too poor to scrape up the $5,000 needed to cover his $50,000 bail, or to hire his own lawyer, Sanders said he's ready to plead guilty to the felony charge. He knows he's been jailed so long that he would be immediately eligible for release.</p>

<p>But Sanders' girlfriend, Kathy McGovern, said she can't even get the part-time public defender to answer her calls.</p>

<p>"Simple drug charge, why are you holding him for over a year?" she asked.</p>

<p>Lauderdale County District Attorney Bilbo Mitchell acknowledges there is a problem and says he has told his assistants "to do everything they can to speed things up."</p>

<p>Money is also a reason for delays in presenting evidence and conducting autopsies. Crime Lab Director Sam Howell says one of the state's four labs is six months behind on testing, because of a lack of analysts to verify and weigh illegal drugs. Many autopsies from last year remain incomplete because Mississippi only has two medical examiners, Howell said. After news stories about the delays, lawmakers this spring allotted money to hire four more beginning July 1.</p>

<p>And inmates who may be mentally ill face truly extraordinary delays, said Dr. Tom Recore, a forensic psychiatrist with the state Department of Mental Health.</p>

<p>"There are 15 beds for 82 counties," he said. "If that sounds like it's not a lot, your ears are not deceiving you."</p>

<p>Recore said 90 to 100 inmates statewide need evaluation at any given time, with most waiting three to four months. The wait time got shorter after more evaluators were hired and counties began using private contractors. But some of the 60 people currently awaiting treatment have been on a list for years, Recore said.</p>

<p>Under a pilot program, mental health professionals are treating inmates directly in two county jails. The state plans to expand the number of beds for prisoners, and lawmakers allotted $1 million to explore a permanent expansion of treatment facilities.</p>

<p>For Sanders, state officials can't act fast enough.</p>

<p>"I've told them I want to plead guilty to my charge," he said. "I've done lost my car, my home, my job, over some nonsense. ... I should have been home a long time ago."</p>

<h2 id="debtorsprisonsoutparoleformorepeople">Debtors’ Prisons Out, Parole For More People</h2>

<p>JACKSON — Criminal-justice reform is and has been a bipartisan issue in the Mississippi Legislature in recent years, and 2018 is no exception. Lawmakers unanimously passed House Bill 387, which had the support of conservative and progressive local and national organizations from Americans for Prosperity to the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p>

<p>The legislation stops the State from running what is, in essence, a debtors' prison for Mississippians who cannot afford their fines and court fees. Judges must determine a defendant's indigence before sending him or her to prison for nonpayment of fines and fees. If a defendant's income is at or below 125 percent of the federal poverty guidelines, the judge must allow the person more time to pay, reduce the amount needed to pay the fines, or allow community service instead of fines.</p>

<p>A single person making $15,175 or less a year would be considered indigent under the new law, which goes into effect July 1. A defendant in a household of four that makes less than $31,375 annually would be considered indigent.</p>

<p>Zoe Towns is the senior director of criminal justice reform at Fwd.us, a bipartisan advocacy organization that follows immigration and criminal justice. She pointed to other lawsuits, including in municipalities in Mississippi where this practice has been deemed unconstitutional.</p>

<p>"(HB 387 is) trying to make sure that the law does not allow the practice of debtors' prisons," Towns told the Jackson Free Press. "Fees and fines and other criminal-justice payments are resulting too often in being pulled back in jail."</p>

<p>No More Stacking</p>

<p>Part of House Bill 387 ensures that the massive criminal-justice reform package the Legislature passed in 2014 has the impact it was intended to have. One part of the new law will prevent judges from stacking technical violations when a person violates the terms of probation or parole. This clarification will ensure that instead of a judge sending someone back to prison or revoking parole entirely on the first technical violation, he or she will go to a technical violation center instead.</p>

<p>Towns said this stacking issue came, in part, from a lack of clarity from the 2014 law.</p>

<p>"We expect that (change) to have a broad impact since there are such high numbers of these revocations," she said.</p>

<p>State Public Defender Andre de Gruy, who serves on the state's re-entry council, estimates that if judges adhere to this change, it could mean a savings of between $12 million to $20 million for MDOC. The logical outcome of this reform would mean fewer Mississippians getting parole or probation revoked and more of them going to a technical violation center for 90 to 180 days as state law allows. MDOC already plans to expand its technical violation center operations this spring, re-opening the Delta Correctional Center in Leflore County as a new 300-bed TVC.</p>

<p>The new reform law also loosens parole eligibility for nonviolent offenders who received enhanced sentences before 2014 (when House Bill 585 passed).</p>

<p>De Gruy estimates that about 177 people will eventually become parole-eligible under this new law, more than 140 of them on July 1. He provided numbers showing that MDOC could save $1.1 million in fiscal-year 2019.</p>

<p>One Passed, Another Vetoed</p>

<p>While Gov. Phil Bryant signed the new reform law with advocates and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers surrounding him, he quietly vetoed another reform effort. Senate Bill 2841 contained a handful of other reforms, including language to allow those in prison to keep their drivers licenses and drug courts to administer opioid drug treatment.</p>

<p>Bryant said he vetoed the bill primarily because a provision would have required MDOC to determine whether an inmate is indigent before making him or her pay parole, probation or supervision fees. Current Mississippi law requires an inmate to pay a monthly $55 fee when he or she is paroled or on probation or supervision 30 days after their release.</p>

<p>When Bryant vetoed the bill, he said MDOC risked losing "millions" of dollars due to the fact that certain inmates paying supervision fees could be deemed indigent. These fees will total an estimated $13.5 million, or about a third of MDOC's community corrections budget, in fiscal-year 2019, legislative budget office documents show.</p>

<p>MDOC estimates it would have lost as much as 75 percent in supervision fee collections in fiscal-year 2019 if SB 2841 became law. This means in the upcoming fiscal year MDOC could collect as much as $10 million in supervision fees from inmates that the legislation would have deemed unable to pay in the first place because they cannot afford it.</p>

<p>SB 2841 would have allowed inmates to be out from behind bars for 90 days before paying their first $55 fee. The bill also would have guaranteed that an inmate deemed indigent did not have parole or probation revoked because they could not pay the fee. While the reform law Bryant signed allows judges to determine whether or not someone can pay a court fine or fee, it does not cover parole or probation fees collected by MDOC in its language.</p>

<p>Download .NEWSDOCUMENTS20180425MBR-1<em>BUDGET</em>REQUEST_SUMMARY</p>

<p>Vetoing SB 2841 will continue a scenario that can go like this: If formerly imprisoned people have appointments with their probation officers, but they do not have their probation fees, they can either show up and risk a violation for nonpayment, or they do not show up because they do not have the money and get a violation for not showing up.</p>

<p>"It really cannot be overstated how mentally and emotionally draining it would be going to your appointment every month knowing that they could revoke your probation or parole that day," criminal-justice advocate Blake Feldman said. "... It really becomes a shakedown with so much on the line."</p>

<p>Rep. Joel Bomgar, R-Madison, who advocated for and supported both criminal justice reform measures during the session, said SB 2841 would have helped improve employability in the state.</p>

<p>"This bill would have helped increase employment prospects for those reentering society after an interaction with the criminal justice system. The bill restored driver's licenses to individuals, as long as their offense wasn't related to driving. This is a common-sense reform that is essential to gainful employment in a rural state like ours. The bill also included provisions to encourage work training in prisons and ensure that fees and fines don't stand as a barrier to employment for those reentering society," Bomgar said in a statement to the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Other states have supervision fees as well, Towns said, but the trends and evidence seem to be moving in the opposite direction as states begin to examine who can pay these fees and who's being punished when they cannot.</p>

<p>"The point of supervision needs to be for public safety, not debt collection," she told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<h2 id="insidejacksonsofficerinvolvedshootingtaskforce">Inside Jackson’s Officer-Involved Shooting Task Force</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Last month, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba had prepared to make an executive decision about how the Jackson Police Department would handle transparency following officer-involved shootings. There have been two deadly ones in Jackson this year alone, and the mayor fundamentally supports releasing the names of officers who shoot citizens, he says, even though the police department is against naming them.</p>

<p>But in the name of a people-oriented government, Lumumba opted to create a task force of citizens and law enforcement to develop the City's policy on how it will handle these instances in the future.</p>

<p>"[I] thought that if we were going to truly make a decision for the community, the community should be involved," the mayor said April 11 at the first officer-involved shooting identification task-force meeting.</p>

<p>Some have critiqued the mayor for choosing "bureaucracy," but Lumumba contends that this is the best way forward, entrusting that the task force will move swiftly but not at the sacrifice of being diligent and prudent.</p>

<p>The task force has the full ability to request any City documents it needs, to have officials to come and speak before them, and to determine how long the process of developing policy needs to take.</p>

<p>While this could be the first task force of this exact nature the nation has ever seen, the 21-member group has a lot to work through including getting nearly two dozen people to reach a consensus on an extremely divided issue.</p>

<p>Who's Who on the Panel?</p>

<p>Rukia Lumumba, the mayor's sister and a social and economic justice advocate, walked into the second officer ID task-force meeting with a list of suggestions on April 16, although she had missed the first meeting.</p>

<p>Most of her motions passed, including moving the meeting times, expanding public comments to at least 20 minutes and adding an additional youth member. She also suggested the group meet in more neutral spaces, as the first meeting took place in a city building across from Jackson City Hall and the second at the police academy.</p>

<p>The group tabled her suggestion of incorporating a citizen affected by an officer-involved shooting with no pending litigation.</p>

<p>The other members who join Rukia Lumumba on the task force include at least five Jackson police officers, who sit next to each other in a bloc. The task force has not yet gone into the weeds of everyone's viewpoint on releasing officers' names, but Paul Hobson, a detective with JPD and president of the Jackson Police Officer Association and member of the task force, has spoken on behalf of JPD's views recently and often in meetings.</p>

<p>"I can tell you and assure you that 100 percent of our department is against the release of officer names as it pertains to shootings," Hobson said in March.</p>

<p>The mayor and JPD Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore sat in on the first meeting to offer guidance and show support, but they are not members of the task force. With not everyone coming to both meetings, it is fuzzy as to who will remain as the core group of devoted individuals throughout this process.</p>

<p>Keyshia Sanders of constituent services for the City of Jackson and the mayor's chief of staff, Safiya Omari, represent the City as non-voting members. Former school-board member Jed Oppenheim of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation takes the minutes for the group. Kay Gex, who only came to the first meeting, is the mayor's neighbor who said she is committed to law enforcement. Nsombi Lambright, a past executive director of the ACLU of Mississippi and current director of a nonprofit called One Voice, is also on the task force. There is also Matt Bolian, a former military intelligence officer and now the channel development manager at C-Spire, and Frances Greer-Morris, who served on the City's Historic Preservation Committee.</p>

<p>Others include consultant Mike Walker; coach James Davis; Ricky Jones, a former JPS school board member; attorney Edley Jones, consultant Mike Walker and Michael Starks. Attorney C.J. Lawrence, the mayor's former law partner and close friend who created the #iftheygunnedmedown campaign following Michael Brown's death in Ferguson, is the chairman, and Jim Hill High School student Ruben Banks serves as the co-chairman of the task force.</p>

<p>The Clarion-Ledger critiqued the mayor for including a man named Terun Moore on the task force. Moore was convicted of capital murder in 2001 at the age of 17 and was sentenced to life without parole. The late Chokwe Lumumba served as his lawyer back then.</p>

<p>A Mississippi Supreme Court judge vacated Moore's sentence in 2014, citing a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that life without parole for juveniles is unconstitutional. At the City's Crime and Justice Summit on April 19, the mayor called out the Ledger for the pushback, although their reporter had left for the evening.</p>

<p>"I knowingly put a member on that board who was someone that was a 'returning citizen' because I thought that that perspective needed to be incorporated in the conversation... . I think that the perspective that does not allow for that to be added to the conversation is an elitist one," the mayor said during the discussion.</p>

<p>Time Will Tell</p>

<p>Nationally speaking, Jackson is taking a unique approach to figuring out how the City will handle police shootings in the future. This is not a citizen's review board as seen in other cities like Charlotte, N.C., and Atlanta, Ga., where a group of appointed citizens review police misconduct, among other things. However, the officer ID task-force could implement a citizen's review board in the forthcoming policy.</p>

<p>What is not different is that police departments throughout the nation have been trying to decide how to deal with releasing names or withholding them in the post-Michael Brown and Ferguson era. In 2016, The Washington Post found that following the 990 lethal officer-involved shootings in 2015, one in five officers' names went undisclosed, with departments citing state laws or department-wide practices for keeping the names a secret.</p>

<p>But, there is more than just the police department feeling unsavory toward a potential release of officers' names.</p>

<p>Adofo Minka, a criminal defense attorney who used to work with the mayor in the early days of both men's legal career, interrupted and effectively brought the first task-force meeting to a close. He wanted community members to be able to speak and brought a list of 15 questions he wanted to raise before the task force. As he sat with the wife and sister of Lee Edward Bonner, whom JPD shot and killed in February, he demanded to know why nobody from a victim's family was appointed to the task force.</p>

<p>When Minka got up toward the end of the meeting and passed out the list of questions to the task-force members, Omari asked him to stop.</p>

<p>"This is a public meeting, ma'am," Minka said to Omari.</p>

<p>"This is a meeting of this task force, the public is invited...," Omari responded before motioning to adjourn.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Bonner family walked out in tears after not being given a chance to speak, as tensions rose between Minka and Omari.</p>

<p>With Rukia Lumumba's motion a week later to include an impacted family member still out on the floor, a family like the Bonners may be included in the future, but only time will tell.</p>

<p>Bipartisan criminal-justice reform is something to sing about, and we applaud the Mississippi Legislature and the governor for passing and signing House Bill 387 into law this session. The measure follows a trend of steady reforms intended to keep nonviolent inmates from serving long sentences and enable them to come back to society.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Legislature passed House Bill 585, which began the wave of reforms, as the State of Mississippi realized savings in corrections costs and judges began to adjust their sentencing habits. What is missing from these discussions, particularly at the Legislature, however, is how the State and counties will pay off their bonds, issued back in the 1990s and early 2000s to build more prisons.</p>

<p>Criminal-justice reform means decreasing reliance on incarceration, which means less money from locking people up. The sheriffs in 22 counties that operate regional jails understand this firsthand and went to the Capitol this week to say so. The majority of those counties are losing funds, while still paying off prison bonds they issued years ago.</p>

<p>Similarly, the State of Mississippi, despite closing the privately run Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in 2016, will be paying for the prison until 2027. These costs need to be at the heart of criminal-justice reform conversations, as well as repairing conditions. As savings are realized in the Mississippi Department of Corrections, justice reinvestment is crucial in helping the state and counties counter their lost revenue with fewer inmates to lock up.</p>

<p>The State cannot idly stand by and shrug as MDOC and local counties lose funding—and eventually jobs—due to a shrinking prison population. It is time to be innovative and evaluate how re-entry and employment programs can help Mississippi communities provide jobs for local people and second chances for those coming out of the prison system.</p>

<p>State leaders must start using basic math and smart planning when it comes to long-term spending on prisons. The State must choose Mississippians over running these facilities as taxpayer-funded enterprises that exist to benefit private prison corporations.</p>

<p>The City of Corinth agreed to settle a lawsuit alleging that the city ran a debtors' prison, locking up men and women before they saw a judge for not paying their fines and fees. Photo by Zeakky/File Illustration</p>

<p>JACKSON — The City of Corinth will stop locking up men and women who cannot afford to pay their fines or bail after reaching an agreement with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the MacArthur Justice Center.</p>

<p>The federal judge needs to approve the plan, but both parties filed an agreement late Wednesday. In December, SPLC and MacArthur sued Corinth on behalf of Sammy Brown and Brian Howell. Howell was unemployed but fined $1,000 for three traffic violations. Municipal Court Judge John C. Ross assessed the $1,000 fine, and Howell had to pay his fine in full or sit in jail at a rate of $25 a day, the lawsuit says.</p>

<p>Brown, charged with public drunkenness in December, had to stay in jail because he could not afford his $600 bond. He does not have a job.</p>

<p>The court and plaintiffs entered an interim agreement in late December, but that agreement did not mean the Corinth Municipal Court and Judge Ross have admitted liability in the case, however.</p>

<p>The proposed settlement agreement ensures that defendants arrested without warrants see a judge within 48 hours, and that the municipal court cannot jail those men and women who cannot afford to pay their fines or bail. Defendants can choose between a $25-a-month payment plan or community service instead of staying in jail, the agreement says.</p>

<p>The settlement agreement sets up a detailed plan for the City of Corinth, which is in line with criminal-justice reforms that take affect statewide on July 1. Judges must determine a defendant's indigence before sending him or her to prison for nonpayment of fines and fees once House Bill 387 becomes state law.</p>

<p>The City of Corinth has also agreed to train all employees whom the new agreement affects.</p>

<p>"The proposed settlement will ensure that the Corinth Municipal Court stays focused on justice and fairness, and eliminates a two-tiered system of justice that previously punished people simply because they were poor. Now, everyone should be treated fairly," Sam Brooke, deputy legal director for the SPLC, said in a press release.</p>

<p>The settlement agreement in Corinth is in line with the new court rules that the Mississippi Supreme Court issued last year that direct judges to follow certain steps when a defendant cannot afford to pay their fines and fees.</p>

<p>"Everyone arrested in Mississippi must be taken before a judge within 48 hours, and except in very rare cases, the law requires that they be released at that first appearance on conditions that do not include buying their way out of jail by giving money to a bail bondsman," Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law, said in a press release.</p>

<p>"Many Mississippi judges continue to impose money bail in every criminal case they handle despite the fact that they have been reminded again and again to stop using bail improperly. Some judges are getting the message, but many are not," he continued. "Those defiant judges who misuse bail are filling our local jails with poor people and costing local taxpayers a huge amount of money in incarceration expenses."</p>

<p>JACKSON — Big House Books, a nonprofit that sends free books by request to inmates, filed a lawsuit against the South Mississippi Correctional Institution this week because inmates there cannot receive books that are donated, the lawsuit says.</p>

<p>"That prison permits inmates to receive books through the mail only if the books have been purchased or if the books are religious. Inmates are not permitted to receive free, non-religious books by mail," the complaint says.</p>

<p>"... The only way to receive secular books through the mail is if the prisoner, family member, or other sender pays for them."</p>

<p>The Mississippi Center for Justice filed the lawsuit in federal court, alleging that the policy to allow inmates to have some books but not donated ones, violates inmates' First and 14th Amendment rights. The complaints asks the court to issue an injunction against the Mississippi Department of Corrections policy cited to inmates about why they cannot receive books from Big House Books.</p>

<p>Two inmates, Charles Owens and Jess Green, at SMCI were told that they could not receive free books from Big House Books due to a certain MDOC policy. Even after filing complaints and formal remedy forms, both Owens and Green were told they could not receive free books unless they were religious.</p>

<p>"The restriction discriminates against inmates like Mr. Owens and Mr. Green who sometimes wish to read donated, non-religious books," the lawsuit says. "The restriction discriminates on the basis of religious content and limits prisoners' access to donated, non-religious books without any justification."</p>

<p>Beth Orlansky, advocacy director at the Mississippi Center for Justice, said that there are similar problems with inmates receiving books from Big House Books at Parchman, too. She said her organization wrote a letter to MDOC asking for the rationale behind the policy change.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Gov. Phil Bryant has blocked an effort to help wean those addicted to opioids off the drugs with medication, as well as assist indigent prisoners. SB 2841, which he vetoed on April 13 citing financial concerns at the Mississippi Department of Corrections, would have enabled drug courts to make medication available to addicts.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 2841 also would have required MDOC to determine the indigence of Mississippians on parole, probation or supervision before assessing monthly community corrections fees. The governor took issue with this part of the bill.</p>

<p>"This bill replaces the discretion of the court or department to grant a hardship waiver to an offender with a statutorily mandated 'determination of indigence' based on Federal Poverty Guidelines. The department estimates that this change in the law could cost millions of dollars annually," he wrote in his veto message.</p>

<p>If the governor's message is correct, it follows that MDOC is bringing in millions of dollars to the Community Service Revolving Fund from Mississippians on probation or parole, who are at or below the federal poverty line currently.</p>

<p>Current state law allows the department to grant a hardship waiver if a person on parole, probation or supervision cannot pay their $55-per-month fee. The sentencing court or MDOC can give out a hardship waiver, but the waiver cannot last past 90 days. Bryant said the current hardship waiver process "has worked."</p>

<p>The Mississippi Department of Corrections had a statement pending at press time, and this story will be updated once it releases it.</p>

<p>Two days before the veto, Bryant signed another criminal-justice reform bill. House Bill 387 extends parole eligibility and judicial discretion for Mississippians considered "habitual offenders" under state law as well as orders judges to determine whether or not a person can afford their court fees or fines before sending them back to jail or prison for not paying.</p>

<p>The law, which Bryant vetoed last year, had support from progressive and conservative groups, including Americans for Prosperity and Fwd.us. The governor signed the bill surrounded by a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers and advocates, Democrats and Republicans. House Bill 387 also creates the Mississippi Sentencing Disparity Taskforce to study how Mississippians are sentenced differently for the same crime from county to county.</p>

<p>"A critical piece of this legislation going forward—one that will be monitored closely—is the effective administration of expanded data collection efforts within the criminal justice system," Jody Owens, managing attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a press release. "Gathering more relevant data on the children who are housed in juvenile detention centers, as well as in county and municipal jails in Mississippi, will provide the state with the starting point it needs to bring additional reforms to the juvenile justice system that will allow it to rehabilitate, not punish, Mississippi's children."</p>

<p>Russ Latino, the state director of Americans for Prosperity, commended the governor for signing House Bill 387 in a statement on April 11.</p>

<p>"HB 387 will reduce the burden on taxpayers, focus precious resources on criminal activity that represents a real threat to the public, and provide people with a second chance to contribute to their families and communities after prison," Latino said in a press release. "This bill and its counterpart, SB 2841, are proof that people from all backgrounds and persuasions can come together to make a difference."</p>

<p>Bryant addressed his embrace of HB 387 while vetoing the second bill in his veto message. "During my administration, we have made good criminal justice reforms, including House Bill 387 that I signed this year," Bryant wrote, saying he supports removing mandatory suspensions of driver's licenses for controlled-substance violations. "... However, I cannot force the Department of Corrections to potentially suffer the loss of millions of dollars, particularly in light of the department's operational budget being cut for fiscal year 2019 by legislative appropriation."</p>

<p>Rep. Joel Bomgar, R-Madison, supported SB 2841 because it would have improved employability, he says.</p>

<p>"This bill would have helped increase employment prospects for those reentering society after an interaction with the criminal justice system. The bill restored driver's licenses to individuals, as long as their offense wasn't related to driving. This is a common-sense reform that is essential to gainful employment in a rural state like ours," Bomgar said in an emailed statement. "The bill also included provisions to encourage work training in prisons and ensure that fees and fines don't stand as a barrier to employment for those reentering society. I was disappointed that the bill did not become law this year, but I am optimistic that the legislature will continue to work on these issues going forward to improve our state's economy."</p>

<p>Correction: A previous version of this story defined the federal poverty guidelines as at or above the federal poverty line, when it should have said "at or below." We apologize for the error. </p>

<p>JACKSON — Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the City of Jackson will host a Crime and Justice Summit tonight at 6 p.m. at the Jackson Convention Complex downtown. While the mayor has made a couple announcements about the summit at public events, including Jackson City Council meetings, scarce details are available about structure and subject matter.</p>

<p>"The summit will address important issues and concerns centering on crime and justice in the capital city. City officials and representatives from the Jackson Police Department will be in attendance," reads a press release about the event.</p>

<p>With so many crime initiatives and issues taking place in the City of Jackson, one has to imagine there are a host of directions this event could go. In a recent interview with the Jackson Free Press, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore confirmed 26 homicides in Jackson in 2018 as of April 11—an average of 6.5 homicides per month.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>There have been at least seven officer-involved shootings since Mayor Lumumba took office, and the City is trying to address that currently. Although the mayor himself supports releasing the names of officers who have shot people on the job, last month he signed an executive order implementing a task force to decide the future policy on if/when officers who shoot people will be identified. Jackson has a longstanding practice of shielding officers' names in these situations and, perhaps, has never willingly released names.</p>

<p>JPD is also facing criticism over the controversial U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions-backed initiative, Project EJECT (Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together). U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst announced the initiative in December, and since then his office has been working "hand in glove" with the Jackson Police Department, he says, to identify which Jacksonians qualify to be prosecuted in the federal system that has no parole and has a much higher propensity for sending those convicted to far away prisons—ejecting them, as Hurst would say.</p>

<p>More recently this JPD-federal partnership has taken the form of gang sweeps with the Monday announcement of 45 arrests, 75 percent of whom were alleged gang members, Hurst said. He would not provide names, however.</p>

<p>Local, state and federal law enforcement also rounded up sex offenders and those with existing warrants, some of whom were found with drugs. There are no details available about arrestees as of yet, but Hurst said it is likely that some of them will fall under Project EJECT. Thirty-five people have been indicted under Project EJECT as of February, with 40 percent of them being charged as felons in possession of a weapon.</p>

<p>Lumumba has distanced himself from Project EJECT, saying at a city council meeting in February that it is not "and never has been an initiative of the City."</p>

<p>Hurst has made it clear to the Jackson Free Press that this violent-crime fighting strategy has been designed strictly for Jackson at the moment, despite reported surges of gang activities on the Gulf Coast and other parts of the state.</p>

<h2 id="supremecourtstrikesdownasvaguepartofimmigrationlaw">Supreme Court Strikes Down as Vague Part of Immigration Law</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-17</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/apr/17/supreme-court-strikes-down-vague-part-immigration-/ </p>

<p>The Supreme Court said Tuesday that part of a federal law that makes it easier to deport immigrants who have been convicted of crimes is too vague to be enforced. Photo by Photo courtesy Flickr/NCinDC</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Tuesday that part of a federal law that makes it easier to deport immigrants who have been convicted of crimes is too vague to be enforced.</p>

<p>The court's 5-4 decision — an unusual alignment in which new Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the four liberal justices — concerns a catchall provision of immigration law that defines what makes a crime violent. Conviction for a crime of violence makes deportation "a virtual certainty" for an immigrant, no matter how long he has lived in the United States, Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her opinion for the court.</p>

<p>The decision is a loss for President Donald Trump's administration, which has emphasized stricter enforcement of immigration law. In this case, President Barack Obama's administration took the same position in the Supreme Court in defense of the challenged provision.</p>

<p>With the four other conservative justices in dissent, it was the vote of the Trump appointee that was decisive in striking down the provision at issue. Gorsuch did not join all of Kagan's opinion, but he agreed with her that the law could not be left in place. Gorsuch wrote that "no one should be surprised that the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague that reasonable people cannot understand its terms and judges do not know where to begin in applying it."</p>

<p>The case turned on a decision from 2015 that struck down a similarly worded part of another federal law that imposes longer prison sentences on repeat criminals. The majority opinion in that case was one of the last written by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016 and whose seat Gorsuch filled.</p>

<p>The 2015 decision "tells us how to resolve this case," Kagan wrote.</p>

<p>Tuesday's decision involves James Dimaya, a native of the Philippines who came to the United States legally as a 13-year-old in 1992. After he pleaded no contest to two charges of burglary in California, the government began deportation proceedings against him. The government argued among other things that he could be removed from the country because his convictions qualified as crimes of violence that allowed his removal under immigration law.</p>

<p>Immigration officials relied on a section of immigration law that lists crimes that make people eligible for deportation. The category in which Dimaya's convictions fell is a crime "that, by its very nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force...may be used in the course of committing the offense."</p>

<p>Immigration judges would have allowed Dimaya to be deported, but the federal appeals court in San Francisco struck down the provision as unconstitutionally vague. The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling Tuesday.</p>

<p>The decision does not interfere with the government's ability to deport people who are convicted of clearly violent crimes, including murder and rape, as well as drug trafficking and other serious offenses. The ruling is limited to a category of crimes that carry a prison term of more than a year, but do not otherwise comfortably fit in a long list of "aggravated felonies" that can lead to deportation.</p>

<p>The case was initially argued in January 2017 by a court that was short a member because of Scalia's death and the refusal of Senate Republicans to act on Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. Deadlocked 4-4, the justices scheduled a new round of arguments once Gorsuch joined the court.</p>

<p>The case is Sessions v. Dimaya, 15-1498.</p>

<h2 id="usattorneytoutsprojectejectstingofallegedgangsterscriminals">U.S. Attorney Touts 'Project EJECT' Sting of Alleged Gangsters, Criminals</h2>

<p>Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst called a press conference at the United States Courthouse downtown Monday to release some details about the results of a recent cooperative sting to go after a mix of alleged criminals with outstanding warrants, gang members and their associates, and sex offenders. He said other agencies will likely refer some of them to his office for prosecution under his controversial crime-fighting initiative Project EJECT—Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together—under which Hurst pledges to go after the "worst of the worst."</p>

<p>"[T]his is what Project EJECT is all about: increased cooperation among our law enforcement to take the worst of the worst off our streets and the empowerment of our citizens and our communities through education, awareness, and assistance," he said Monday.</p>

<p>Last week, a "surge" of law enforcement took place in Jackson to sweep up a variety of suspects, whom Hurst declined to name. The U.S. Marshals Service's Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force led the arrests sweep, with members from the Jackson Police Department, Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics, Mississippi Bureau of Investigations, Mississippi Department of Corrections, Pearl Police Department, Homeland Security Investigations, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives, Ridgeland Police Department, Biloxi Police Department, the Metro 1 Air Support, and sheriff's departments from Hinds, Madison and Rankin counties.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>Task-force members arrested 45 individuals of various races, almost 75 percent of whom were identified as gang members, including Gangster Disciples, Vice Lords, Simon City Royals, Latin Kings and Aryan Brotherhood, Hurst said. The task force "substantially increased" its numbers of officers up to 60 for last week's bust, and that kind of cooperation among law enforcement, Hurst said, allows them to dismantle gangs, prosecute violent criminals and remove sex offenders from the capital city.</p>

<p>"[B]ecause of the actions taken last week, the City of Jackson and the surrounding areas today are safer and more secure," Hurst said.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions praised the action in a statement emailed to local media. "When law enforcement officers work together, we get results,” Sessions said. “The arrest of more than 30 gang members in Jackson is the result of effective collaboration between all levels of law enforcement—federal, state and local—to target the most violent criminals in our communities."</p>

<p>Sessions' approach to crime-fighting draws much criticism, however, including from David Kennedy, a criminologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, who called the AG's "evidence-free strategy ... a criminologist's nightmare." That despite Hurst telling the Jackson Free Press that Project Eject is modeled on the Kennedy-led Boston Gun Project and Operation Ceasefire violence strategies.</p>

<p>"Sessions has called for a return to the 'war on drugs' menu—more law enforcement, mandatory minimums and long sentences, even the anti-drug D.A.R.E. program—plus a new focus on heavy immigration enforcement and a withdrawal from DOJ attention to police misconduct. But we now know for a fact that these things don’t work, and can actually make matters worse," Kennedy wrote in an essay for The Hill.</p>

<p>Hurst said it is important to identify gang members if his office is going to make any headway on "breaking gangs" so they can go up the ladder and get the leaders. "It's only by getting the gang members and getting the gang leaders that we're able to break the gang' themselves," Hurst said.</p>

<p>Many violence experts, however, say that it is unwise for law enforcement to fixate on gang membership over investigating and prosecuting specific crimes. "If I say you're a gangster and that you're talking to gangsters, then you're a gangster. ... It is the standard way that law enforcement will try to deal with a problem that cannot be dealt with with force," Ron Noblet, who trains law enforcement around the country in effective gang intervention and consults with the Urban Peace Institute in Los Angeles, Calif., told the Jackson Free Press. Noblet was also the lead investigator on a State-funded 2016 study of gangs and youth crime in Jackson and is a featured character in the book, "Blue: The LAPD and the Battle to Redeem American Policing," for his role in reducing gang violence there.</p>

<p>In addition, violence experts warn that suddenly disrupting, or "splintering," a gang by arresting a leader can create a leadership vacuum and increase the chance for violence as members jostle for power.</p>

<p>The details of the arrestees in last week's operation have not yet been made public, so it is not clear whether or not the gang members arrested were leaders, low-ranking members or active gang members.</p>

<p>Hurst said the task force seized a number of firearms and found illegal drugs including ecstasy, marijuana and crystal methamphetamine.</p>

<p>How Mississippi pursues people believed to be in gangs.</p>

<p>Officers identified targeted gang members through word-of-mouth and tattooed insignia, Hurst said at the press conference, but he would not divulge further details about how they decided who was in a gang or on the round-up list. The U.S. attorney diverted a question from a reporter about whether or not there has been a surge in gang activity in Jackson, pointing instead to a surge in law enforcement. He added an oft-quoted and unsupported statement by law enforcement—that some people deny that there is a gang issue in the state.</p>

<p>"But I think, not only the arrest, but the engagement with various gang members this week show that we have a gang problem not only in Jackson, but I think you'll start to see this around the state, unfortunately," Hurst said.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Legislature recently declined, for the second year in a row, to pass an expanded gang law in the state to make it easier for prosecute and attach additional sentences due to gang membership.</p>

<p>The U.S. attorney told the Jackson Free Press earlier this year that he does not have a plan to do a Project Eject-type operation outside Jackson, including on the Gulf Coast, which has seen a surge of gang-related activity and violence over the last decade. The JFP reported recently that the state's existing gang law was only used against African Americans from 2010 until 2017, even as the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators told The Clarion-Ledger last fall that 53 percent of the state's verified gang members are white.</p>

<p>Project EJECT is part of Project Safe Neighborhoods, a national strategy revived by Sessions that is known for targeting mostly African Americans in U.S. cities for possessing illegal weapons. The idea is to subject people picked up for federal gun crimes to expanded sentences and "eject" them into federal prisons far from their home state—a strategy that experts such as Kennedy, the criminologist behind Operation Ceasefire, say targets street-level people of color over the suppliers of the weapons and does not, in fact, make communities safer over time.</p>

<p>Sessions, though, is a fan of the massive-arrest approach behind both Project EJECT and Project Safe Neighborhoods. "It’s also an example of how customizing our strategy at the local level through the Project Safe Neighborhoods program helps us use our resources more effectively," he said in the statement.</p>

<p>A full archive of the JFP's "Preventing Violence" series, supported by grants from the Solutions Journalism Network. Photo of Zeakyy Harrington by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Hurst said the task force is also rounding up sex offenders, weapons or not, because they're the "worst of the worst" and would not necessarily have to be charged with a gun crime. As of February, all people indicted under Project EJECT had been accused of a crime involving a gun from felons in possession of a weapon to armed robbery.</p>

<p>"I know there's been some misconceptions about the only crimes that fall under Project EJECT are guns, and that's actually not accurate—we're going after violent criminals. And those criminals can be violent without guns so we're prosecuting whatever tools we have in the federal system we're going after the violent offenders in our community," Hurst said, veering from the original Project Safe Neighborhoods mission and design into crimes that are typically in the jurisdiction of local, not federal, authorities.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department's involvement in Project EJECT, in Hurst's eyes, is a "match made in heaven." The Project EJECT Task Force works "hand in glove" with his office, he said, and either JPD will call his office when they think something qualifies for federal charges or vice versa.</p>

<p>"Again, I can't say enough good things about (Interim Chief Anthony Moore) and his department and what they've meant to this project and how successful it's been so far," Hurst said.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has distanced himself from Project EJECT, however. "Project EJECT is (not) and has never been an initiative of the City," Lumumba said at a recent Jackson City Council meeting that drew heated pushback on the City's role in Project EJECT. "... This administration has never said it is in favor of Project EJECT, we have never made any comments on Project EJECT. In my opinion, it may be out of our sphere of influence. What our police department is tasked with doing is investigating cases."</p>

<p>Hurst said more details will be available soon about the promised prevention, the reentry and the awareness aspects of Project EJECT.</p>

<p>In his latest attempt to provide a smoke screen for violent cops, Lumumba has created a task force through executive order to deliberate over the question of whether the City should release the names of police officers involved in acts of violence against civilians. Photo by William H. Kelly III.</p>

<p>In the "most radical city on the planet," the "emperor" has no clothes. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has repeatedly provided cover for the Jackson Police Department, which has consistently exacted violence on residents. He allows JPD to operate with impunity in the face of calls from community members to hold officers accountable for their actions.</p>

<p>In his latest attempt to provide a smoke screen for violent cops, Lumumba has created a task force through executive order to deliberate over the question of whether the City should release the names of police officers involved in acts of violence against civilians. The task force is comprised of government bureaucrats, police officers, Lumumba family members and professionals who will likely never have the types of experiences that poor and working-class black people have with JPD.</p>

<p>His campaign slogan, "when I become mayor, you become mayor," speaks to a governing process that allows residents to have democratic control over the decisions that impact their lives. However, the task force's creation is mayor-centered and does not represent direct democracy.</p>

<p>At the first meeting on April 11, it was evident from the start that JPD would dominate it. Officers who were not a part of the task force spoke at will. However, community members were told they would not be allowed to address the task force.</p>

<p>Eventually, after residents pressed them about the undemocratic nature of the process, members relented and voted to offer residents 10 minutes to speak toward the end of each meeting. The task force also adopted the suggestion of a non-member officer to host the second meeting at JPD training headquarters. Apparently, no one on the task force thought it would be problematic to invite residents to a meeting space that the department controls to discuss matters critical of JPD.</p>

<p>Mayor Lumumba has said that the task force represents the will and voice of the people. During the second meeting, this well-dressed lie was exposed. Previously, the mayor said that he established the task force because certain community members did not want him to release the identities of officers. Task-force appointee and Lumumba administration Chief of Staff Safiyah Omari revealed that the committee came about as a result of a compromise between Lumumba and JPD.</p>

<p>He could have issued an executive order mandating the names of officers involved in violence against civilians be released without the smoke screen of a task force. However, he won't because it is not politically expedient for him to do so. When task-force members discussed expanding the scope of the committee, Omari told them that they would have to get the approval of the mayor because his executive order would not allow them to do that. But if we are all "co-mayors," shouldn't the people be able to decide the scope and direction of the task force?</p>

<p>Lumumba and his political allies say that "the people" must decide. Who are the people? How do "the people" decide? It appears that his desire to follow the will of the people has been relegated to the realm of theory. His practice is to appoint individuals who are loyal to his political interests. This is the type of nepotism and cronyism that breeds political corruption and opportunism.</p>

<p>This is the status quo. This is not the "radical" change that he promised to the residents of Jackson. The task force is a farce and cruel jest in the face of very serious calls for the imposition of transparency and accountability on a murderous and violent police state.</p>

<p>Within a week of my reports in the JFP and The Guardian about that glaring disparity going viral, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst had assembled heavily armed members of 15 agencies to swarm Jackson decidedly looking for gang members of all hues. Photo by</p>

<p>Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Dozens of officers from 15 federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies gathered in a circle in front of the new colorful Jackson mural facing State Street meant to symbolize a better capital city. The Clarion-Ledger's cops reporter was invited to join the nighttime gang hunters with her video camera.</p>

<p>The videos the reporter later posted may not have included interviews of family members of the 45 people arrested that night, or with the man whose face she filmed pressed to a porch with a cop sitting on top of it, or with violence and gang experts around the country who would tell her, and local cops and political leaders here if they asked, that this "surge" is exactly the wrong way to go about making our communities safer.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Donald Trump adore these kinds of old-school arrest sweeps, especially when used against people of color—which they usually are in America, even in states that have high numbers of white gang members and other criminals.</p>

<p>I reported recently that from 2010 to 2017, only African Americans (97 of them) were prosecuted under the state's existing gang law, even as the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators is hawking the growth of white gangs over the last decade, telling the Ledger that 53 percent of the state's verified gang members are white.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>If that is true—and it could be considering the growth of Simon City Royals, Aryan Brotherhood, Latin Kings (many are white, I'm told), biker gangs like the Bandidos and others—it means that the gang hunters are still targeting a lot of black people. Within a week of my reports in the JFP and The Guardian about that glaring disparity going viral, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst had assembled heavily armed members of 15 agencies to swarm Jackson decidedly looking for gang members of all hues.</p>

<p>In his press conference, Hurst made a point to mention the Royals, the ABs and other white gang members rounded up in Jackson, and the Ledger cops reporter was sure to include images of white people arrested in her PR videos for the raid that really could be used as warrior cop recruitment. She even showed an officer in Army green with an AR-15 patch on his shoulder, holding a mugshot of a white suspect.</p>

<p>We got it. White arrests, too. Check.</p>

<p>How Mississippi pursues people believed to be in gangs.</p>

<p>But don't let all the posturing obscure the key point. This should not be a race to round up and film more white gang members just to prove law enforcement aren't racist (and it doesn't prove that anyway). Bad policing is bad policing even if you throw more white mugshots on the pile.</p>

<p>These sweeps are bad policing for everybody, just like cops high-speed-chasing shoplifters and killing bystanders, or firing into moving vehicles instead of getting out of the way. ("Move!" an NYPD captain told me is the response to a moving car.)</p>

<p>It's a fallacy to believe a traditionally racist-plus-bad policy is suddenly a smart one or no longer racist just because officials apply them to more white people. No, that just means more whites are victims of the practices that actually make them more likely to commit worse crimes.</p>

<p>This embrace of debunked practices is where it's really time to challenge law enforcement in Mississippi. This is not the wild, wild west anymore, and law enforcement aren't hired to be warriors in the OK Corral with AR-15 patches and he-man slogans like, "Certainly there is no hunting of man like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never really care for anything else thereafter." That, by the way, was an Ernest Hemingway quote the infamous Street Crimes Unit in New York City had printed on T-shirts to inspire them when they went prowling the streets at night there.</p>

<p>What they found was Amadou Diallo smoking in his front yard, whom they shot 41 times because he had a wallet in his hand. Then, the hunters were acquitted.</p>

<p>Much is written about the "warrior" mindset in policing. Sometimes, such as with Diallo's killers, it's hard to know which side of the gang fight is the most violent. And that should not ever be the case with the ones professing to be the good guys.</p>

<p>What good cops, and their leaders, do is constantly welcome new information about what works and what doesn't. Study. Train. Retrain. Question practices. It's the same thing I've done both in the craft of journalism, and it's the same thing I do to know what I know about crime policies. I read long evidence-based reports, talk to the best criminologists and crime researchers in the country, visit cities that are instituting smart policing strategies designed to prevent crime and not increase recidivism and grow gangs by packing more young people into violent prisons without trying to rehabilitate them first.</p>

<p>Those practices are antiquated policing that continue cycles of violence. And it's often done because a) no one has bothered to know any better (and that includes cops reporters) and b) they are doing it for the wrong reasons—votes, racism, meanness, feigned toughness, playing with artillery.</p>

<p>Mississippi has always been stubborn about seeking or letting in new information. David Kennedy and colleagues designed Operation Ceasefire, which Hurst told me is a model for Project EJECT. Kennedy scoffed at that in a later interview. Kennedy also told me he had evolved much about his model since the early Boston Gun Project, because he embraced feedback, data and research on what works for violence reduction and community trust, and what does not. (Hurst also mentioned the Boston project as a model for Project EJECT, which Kennedy roundly disputes.)</p>

<p>Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, openly conflates criticism of the expanded gang law he sponsored with saying "gangs do not exist."</p>

<p>What doesn't work is rounding up people, squishing their faces into a porch or the pavement for the cameras, and then packing them into prisons across the country, per Kennedy and every top crime researcher in the country right now. Sessions may be salivating to re-ignite the mass-incarceration wave, but all of us will pay for that serious mistake here at home. Think about it this way: The need for re-entry programs wouldn't be so urgent if many people weren't coming out of prison hellholes ripe to commit more crime.</p>

<p>Oh, and let's put this straw man to rest. Even if Hurst, along with Sen. Brice Wiggins and the Ledger's cops reporter keep proclaiming that phantoms out here are saying that "gangs do not exist in Mississippi," no one with a brain is saying that. What we are saying, if they will actually listen, is that they are hawking the very strategies that will make gangs, and violent crime, worse and our state much less safe. This must stop.</p>

<p>Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore, known since Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba appointed him in January as a man of few words, opened the door to his office in the Jackson Police Department on April 11. He was cheerful and ready to engage.</p>

<p>The chief only declined to answer one question—about his views of the newly formed officer-involved-shooting identification task force the mayor authorized last month. The first meeting would be just a couple hours after the interview, and he wanted to defer to it.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Moore went into the weeds of federal partnerships, his hopes to secure funding for tasers and body cameras ,and the realities of being a police officer in the capital city of Mississippi.</p>

<p>There are new things in place under Moore, including a downtown foot-patrol unit, the Project EJECT partnership with the U.S. Attorney's office and other federal entities, and an in-house Hinds County assistant district attorney.</p>

<p>Moore and the mayor have also halted "perp walks," where media request that a suspect in custody be paraded before them for photos and camera footage. JPD is no longer sending out mugshots of juveniles charged as adults or anyone shot by an officer in order to avoid implying criminality at the point of arrest.</p>

<p>With 34 years of experience with JPD, Moore knows the ins and outs of the department he inherited, one with low officer numbers and under scrutiny for its use-of-force policy that dates back to 2004 and does not include identification of any officer who shoots a civilian.</p>

<p>Since Moore took over as chief from former Chief Lee Vance in January, JPD officers have killed two people.</p>

<p>Moore also brings an academic background in criminal justice, and he hopes to use all of his tools to rewrite the use-of-force policy, keep morale high in the police department, and keep people safe in Jackson, which has seen an average of 6.5 homicides a month in 2018 as of April 11. The interim chief spoke to the Jackson Free Press in his office in police headquarters.</p>

<p>How have your first months as chief been?</p>

<p>It's been challenging. Of course being a new chief, obviously, you're going to experience various issues and things you have to deal with. But I can say that we're moving forward with a lot of things I'm trying to implement. Obviously, our manpower is a major issue right now. And so we're addressing that, trying to get our recruit class started. We anticipate on getting this class started, hopefully, at the end of May or either mid-June. That's our wish right now.</p>

<p>So, we're still in the process of trying to get 50 recruits for this particular class. We don't know if we're going to get that many, but we're hopeful. ... I'm also trying to implement a career-development plan to retain officers and recruit officers, and we think that is extremely important, along with benefits for officers—it's (also) about retaining officers.</p>

<p>Right now, we're at 351 officers—extremely short. I can remember when we were at 525 officers here at the police department. Currently we're budgeted for 418. But, we hope to increase those numbers, and we also hope to have continuous classes after this first class. We want to get our numbers back up over 500. That's the goal right now. But, this is as low as I have ever seen it since I've been employed at the police department.</p>

<p>What can you do with a fuller police force that you cannot do now?</p>

<p>I think it's going to help us in our efforts of being proactive. ... Obviously, when you're proactive, you deter crime.</p>

<p>So having a lot more manpower is going to help us be more efficient in our delivery of services to the citizens of Jackson, and I think that's a key component when it comes to community policing in our efforts.</p>

<p>Do you hope to replicate the new downtown foot-patrol unit elsewhere in the city?</p>

<p>I haven't looked at it as far as implementing it in other parts of the City as of yet. I think it's extremely important to have a presence in the downtown area. A lot of cities have downtown walking beats, and I know at one time we've had it here. Not only that, we don't just want to have a walking beat, but we want to implement a bike patrol along with a Segway patrol.</p>

<p>We've gotten positive feedback about our officers walking downtown, being visible, communicating with a lot of the businesses downtown. I know it's only been a week or so, but so far I think it's been very successful, and it's been met with a lot of praise. So we want to continue to do that also. I think that's extremely important in developing that bond and that collaboration with the business owners and the citizens downtown.</p>

<p>Is it hard to hire for police departments in general, or is this a Jackson-specific issue?</p>

<p>Ko, you know, I think it's a combination of both. I think you're dealing with a different breed of millennials, so to speak. I think there are a number of factors. The law-enforcement profession is a tough profession, and I don't know if a lot of people are more dedicated, more or less, as to coming into the profession.</p>

<p>You also have to look at the benefits associated with it, too. So, I think it's a combination of both. We've got to also look at the fact that we're in competition with other agencies. When you look at places like Memphis, Atlanta, Dallas, when we have to compete with those agencies, those are extremely hard things to do. But we're doing everything we can to try to attract as many officers as we can to beef up our force.</p>

<p>With the Jackson residency requirement lifted, do you still hope the core of the force will be from the community?</p>

<p>Well, yes. I think so, but again, a lot of times you have to be able to attract quality candidates, and my concern is if you can come to work, be here on time, serve the citizens of Jackson.</p>

<p>How do you deal with violent crime in Jackson?</p>

<p>Homicide is an issue in the city of Jackson. We stand at 26 homicides as of right now (for this year). They occur for various reasons, everything from domestic disputes, arguments between individuals, (and) there have been a few cases of robberies-—some that we're still trying to determine why.</p>

<p>But I can say that I think homicide is a behavioral problem. I believe people need to learn how to settle their differences other than using violence, other than using guns. I don't' think that's just a problem here in Jackson, Mississippi; I think it's a problem across the nation.</p>

<p>You can have a million police officers out here—now keep in mind, we're going to do our part, we're going to be out there. We're going to hit the hot spots, we're going to hit the troubled areas, we're going to do everything that we can to reduce crime and reduce violent crime in the City of Jackson. But, I think, by and large, it's a big behavioral problem. People need to learn how to settle their difference other than using violence. I think if we educate people, I think that's going to be a big help to us.</p>

<p>I can say that we're doing various things when it comes to addressing crime. We're deploying several crime-fighting strategies. We typically have quarterly searches that we do in the City of Jackson. Now that's composed of our partners from the federal agencies, everybody from ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives), DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration, (U.S.) Marshals (Service).</p>

<p>We all come together, and we do these surges in Jackson at various times, which may be for three to four days, and those have been very successful in deterring crime in the City of Jackson.</p>

<p>Not only that, we also have other units, and I don't give away all of my crime-fighting tactics, but I'll just touch on them on the surface. We have a street-level unit that I used to run prior to becoming chief, and we address those various issues hitting hotspots in certain areas, problem areas where we have high crime. That unit works all over the city; it's composed of approximately 15 officers. It's been in existence for going on two years now.</p>

<p>That's been a big help in the City of Jackson along with DART (Direct Action Response Team), who's also out there doing a lot of good things.</p>

<p>A lot of times it's not just about being reactive, you have to have a proactive approach in order to fight and deter crime, I think that's extremely important.</p>

<p>How much support do federal agencies provide JPD, especially in programs like Operation Cross Country and Project EJECT?</p>

<p>It really depends on the type of crime. We get assistance from all the federal agencies, everybody from the FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigations), ATF, and as I mentioned the DEA and the Marshals' service. Now, there is a task force that's currently in operation, it's known as the violent crime task force that's composed of members from those various agencies I mentioned. The idea is to go out and address violent crime.</p>

<p>What I mean by that is, let's say there's an armed robbery of a business, well, you'll have members from the task force who will go out on scene. Say JPD is dispatched out there. These members will go out on scene, assist in the investigation and come back and try to work that case and develop leads which could potentially lead to a federal investigation, or if it doesn't rise to that level, a local investigation or state investigation. So that's been very successful with our federal partners in addressing crime, and I can say we've had a high rate of success with that.</p>

<p>How much do you work with Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith?</p>

<p>A lot. Of course, I don't know if you're aware, we actually have an assistant district attorney assigned to the police department who's actually housed here. That is something that I, along with the agreement of DA Smith, that we instituted recently. It's been a big help.</p>

<p>An archive of reporting on controversies surrounding Hinds County district attorneys, present and past.</p>

<p>A lot of times having someone housed here in the police department is really beneficial to our detectives because they can discuss cases and go over cases. And you have a district attorney here that can help answer a lot of questions, you know, from the legal aspect.</p>

<p>I can remember years ago when I was a detective, we had that very thing here. We would have an ADA assigned to the police department. We were able to re-implement that, and that's been very successful. We started in January, and we want to continue that partnership along with the district attorney.</p>

<p>Could you touch on the topic of juveniles and perp walks in the City?</p>

<p>Well, perp walks is a practice that's been going on for some time. I along with the mayor's office have been discussing this, and we've decided to discontinue this practice for a couple reasons. We don't want to seem like a person is being criminalized by having them photographed as they're leaving out of the jail, handcuffs and waist shackles on them. We think that this is not in the best interest, and so we decided to discontinue that practice at this time.</p>

<p>Talk about the decision to withhold mugshots of citizens shot by police.</p>

<p>Well, again, I think it's a situation where you don't want to make it seem like a person is guilty of something by showing a mugshot of them. That's something that we've gotten away from. We just want to let the criminal-justice system and the process play out like it should and not seem like, again, we're trying to criminalize somebody based on a mugshot. So that's something that we are getting away from.</p>

<p>Are you looking to revise the use-of-force policy?</p>

<p>Absolutely, absolutely. That is a huge topic that I am currently looking into right now. And I can say it is going to be revised. It's no question about that. We anticipate probably having a new use-of-force policy I am hoping very, very soon. I can't give you an exact date on it. But, absolutely, we're definitely going to revise that.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>It's important—change of times. I mean, there's some things in our use-of-force policy we need to update. It's just plain and simple. We think that's important to do. Not only that, with the scrutiny that the Jackson Police Department has been under, we've taken a long look at it, and we do believe it needs a revision. So we are in a process of revising it now.</p>

<p>How do tasers work in this department?</p>

<p>Every officer in the department does not have a taser. We're in the process of trying to purchase tasers for every officer in the department to have one.</p>

<p>I want to say we have about maybe 60 to 65 officers (who) actually have tasers. We think that it's definitely a less lethal weapon that could be used, and it could be beneficial to us in not using deadly force in various instances. It's being worked on.</p>

<p>How about body cameras? Although imperfect, is there any interest for them at JPD?</p>

<p>There is. Of course funding is the biggest issue right now, and we're looking at trying to come up with some grant funding to try to see if we can purchase body cameras. That is something that is on our list, and we hope to have that accomplished real soon. Sometimes it takes time with grants, but that is something that we're looking at.</p>

<p>What's morale like at JPD?</p>

<p>I've been out to speak with the officers. I haven't spoken with every single officer in the department. I think they are optimistic. I like to go out and personally introduce myself and look at somebody face-to-face and talk to them and let them know what the vision is for the department. Getting feedback, I think they are optimistic about the future of the police department.</p>

<p>It's going to take time. Nothing happens overnight, and I think trying to implement new things and bring things to the police department, our officers understand that it takes time. So I want to make sure that I emphasize that to them where they can understand what we're trying to do.</p>

<p>Can you talk about your academic background with criminal justice?</p>

<p>I've been in it a long time. I started out back in 2000, so I've been teaching for 18 years. I teach criminal justice and political science courses. My background is in both political science and criminal justice. I have graduate degrees in those areas. I've been teaching at Hinds Community College and also Jackson State. I enjoy it. I still do it on a limited basis, but it's been adventurous. Once I retire (from JPD), it's something that I want to keep doing in the future, and I've enjoyed every bit of it, the entire 18 years I've been doing it. It's helped me a lot in my skills and experience being a better person in being able to apply some of those things at the police department.</p>

<p>How long have you been in Jackson, and what do you hope for the city?</p>

<p>I've been here all my life. Obviously I want Jackson to be a safe city, that's first and foremost.</p>

<p>By Stephen Wilson</p>

<p>I would love to see it flourish back to the way it used to be. I would love to see our infrastructure be a lot better. I want to see businesses come back to Jackson. I want to see Metrocenter Mall come back to life.</p>

<p>A lot of times people grow up and they leave Jackson. I've had a vested interest in Jackson all my life, decided not to leave. Had a few opportunities to leave, but I love Jackson been here all my life, and I don't plan on going anywhere when I retire.</p>

<p>This has been my home, I have a passion for Jackson. I want to see it get back to being one of the most thriving cities, and I think we're doing that.</p>

<p>A lot of the things that the mayor's implemented in the City of Jackson are a lot of good things, and I think we're getting back on track to where we need to be.</p>

<p>What made you want to be a police officer?</p>

<p>Ever since I was a kid, it was something that I always dreamed about. I can remember coming up that I used to be a police explorer. We have that program today. It was just something that I dreamed as a kid that I always wanted to be a police officer. I've been fortunate and blessed enough to be able to put on the uniform ever since I was 20, 21 years old and enjoy what I do every single day. Wouldn't trade anything for it. I'm just one of those diehard people when it comes to what I do.</p>

<p>Why do you think you were chosen to be interim chief?</p>

<p>Well, that's a decision the mayor made obviously. I think a lot of officers around the police department respect me as an individual and know what I stand for and that was a deciding factor in why I became interim chief. So, that's what I can say. I think the mayor has confidence in me to be able to run this department and make sure that it's being run and managed the best it can be. But, I think a lot of it did happen based on my character and who I am.</p>

<p>Do you want to stay on as chief permanently?</p>

<p>Yes, I would love to. There are a lot of things I would like to see change here; it's going to take a little time to get them done. But I would love to serve as permanent chief. Of course, that's not my decision. We'll see how things work out.</p>

<p>What would you want people to know about you?</p>

<p>I can say that I'm a passionate person, I believe in treating people fairly, and I believe in our officers treating people fairly and with professionalism and respect. So I want the citizens to know that we're going to do everything in our power to make sure that we're the most professional police department here in the state of Mississippi.</p>

<p>With that being said, obviously I want crime to go down, and I think it's important for us to be proactive, and I think it's important for us to have a connection with the community—community policing is paramount. You must have community policing; you have to have the citizens support you. If not, you're going to fail.</p>

<p>Having that support, having the community behind us, us partnering with the community is extremely important. I can say there's a lot of things that we're doing right now when it comes to that.</p>

<p>We have COPS (Community Oriented Policing Services) meetings every month where we sit down with members out of the community in each precinct and discuss crime issues. We have individual meetings with citizens that may want to talk with a commander.</p>

<p>Bigger things are citizens' police academies, from which we recently had approximately 35 citizens graduate. I encourage all citizens to try to go through the citizens police academy. It really gives you a sideline view of what the police department is about and what officers do on a daily basis. And we have nothing but positive feedback from it. We went from having citizens police academies two times year to four times a year now. Our next one is going to be scheduled in June.</p>

<p>Would you say police have a scary job day-to-day?</p>

<p>It is. Being a police officer is a tough job. Police officers are often faced with dangerous, violent situations on a daily basis that a lot of times the media never hears about. Officers put their lives on the line each and every day. They don't know if they're going to come home at night to their families.</p>

<p>But we know what we signed up for, we know what we have to do as officers, and we take that risk every single day we put on the uniform. It's part of the job, and I can say.</p>

<p>A lot of times officers engage in situations where they de-escalate them. No violence is used, nobody gets hurt. And I know that there have been some issues with officers when it comes to officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>It's a dangerous job, and with encountering the criminal element that these officers do, it's tough. I'm thankful that no officers have been seriously injured, and I pray that that doesn't happen.</p>

<p>When they took an oath to serve, they understand what they face.</p>

<p>Does JPD communicate with families of people that police shot and killed?</p>

<p>We've reached out. I personally reached out to the (Crystalline) Barnes family and expressed my condolences.</p>

<p>I've said in the past, these are very unfortunate situations. Nobody wins.</p>

<p>It's just bad when it comes to officer-involved shootings, and I expressed my sentiments all the time, and I just think it's very unfortunate. ... But again, it's part of the job that we do.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions is praising the efforts of federal, state and local law-enforcement agencies, including the Jackson Police Department, for sweeps in Jackson netting 45 arrests, of which 31 are "documented gang members," he says. hoto courtesy Flickr/Gage Skidmore</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. — The U.S. Department of Justice and Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement today praising its operation last week alongside the Jackson Police Department and other agencies that swept up 45 people in Jackson, including 31 "documented gang members, the release says. The sweeps were a part of the controversial Project Eject/Safe Neighborhood strategy that Sessions resuscitated since Donald Trump's election. The DOJ press statement follows, verbatim:</p>

<p>JACKSON, MS – The U.S. Marshals Service’s Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force, made up of Deputy U.S. Marshals and other federal, state and local law enforcement officers, increased their numbers, expanded their operations, and led a successful violent crime reduction initiative last week in the Jackson metro area, announced U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst and U.S. Marshal George White. This surge of law enforcement, in cooperation with the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Project EJECT, executed outstanding warrants, targeted known gang members and their associates, and searched for sex offenders who had violated the terms of their supervised release. The Task Force also worked to identify targets and collect tangible criminal intelligence to further its work in the future of removing violent criminal offenders from the streets.</p>

<p>“When law enforcement officers work together, we get results,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said. “The arrest of more than 30 gang members in Jackson is the result of effective collaboration between all levels of law enforcement – federal, state and local – to target the most violent criminals in our communities. It’s also an example of how customizing our strategy at the local level through the Project Safe Neighborhoods program helps us use our resources more effectively. I want to thank our Deputy U.S. Marshals and all of the task force members who played a role in these arrests. They exemplify the proven law enforcement methods that we will continue to prioritize going forward.”</p>

<p>“We are dismantling gangs, prosecuting violent criminals and removing sex offenders from the streets of Jackson,” said U.S. Attorney Hurst. “I commend the U.S. Marshals and the Gulf Coast Fugitive Task Force for substantially increasing their manpower this past week in our Capitol City, becoming a force multiplier on our streets and proactively taking the fight directly to the criminal element. I look forward to our office prosecuting some of these violent criminals under Project EJECT. It is only through such cooperation among law enforcement, and by empowering our citizens and our communities, that we will make Jackson and its people safer and more secure.”</p>

<p>During last week’s operation, the Fugitive Task Force increased its manpower to 60 members and was able to arrest 45 individuals, 31 of whom were documented gang members, including Gangster Disciples, Vice Lords, Simon City Royals, Latin Kings, and the Aryan Brotherhood, among others. During these arrests, a number of firearms were seized and several arrestees were found to be in possession of various illegal drugs, including marijuana, ecstasy, and crystal methamphetamine. While the details of these arrests cannot yet be made public, as investigations are ongoing, some of these individuals are expected to be prosecuted under Project EJECT.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Hurst, who accompanied the Task Force one night during their operations, praised the tenacity, dedication and professionalism of these Deputy U.S. Marshals and Task Force Officers from the following agencies:</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department</p>

<p>Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics</p>

<p>Hinds County Sheriff’s Office</p>

<p>Mississippi Bureau of Investigations</p>

<p>Rankin County Sheriff’s Office</p>

<p>Mississippi Department of Corrections</p>

<p>Homeland Security Investigations</p>

<p>Madison County Sheriff’s Office</p>

<p>Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives</p>

<p>United States Attorney’s Office</p>

<p>Metro 1 Medical Air Support</p>

<p>Project EJECT is an initiative by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Mississippi under the U.S. Department of Justice’s Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program bringing together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to reduce violent crime and make our neighborhoods safer for everyone. Attorney General Jeff Sessions reinvigorated PSN in 2017 as part of the Department’s renewed focus on targeting violent criminals, directing all U.S. Attorney’s Offices to work in partnership with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement and the local community to develop effective, locally-based strategies to reduce violent crime.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Gov. Phil Bryant has vetoed a bill that he says would cause a financial hardship to the Mississippi Department of Corrections.</p>

<p>Bryant says Senate Bill 2841 would have erased the discretion of department employees or judges to grant hardship waivers for offenders who say they're too poor to pay $55-a-month fees while on probation, parole or other supervision.</p>

<p>The bill would have made waivers automatic for those fitting the federal definition of poverty. Bryant says the current process has worked, and granting more waivers could cost the Department of Corrections millions of dollars.</p>

<p>The governor says he regrets that the veto kills other parts of the bill, including expansion of treatment options for people supervised by drug courts and suspension of driver's licenses for drug convictions unrelated to driving.</p>

<p>JACKSON — If you walked into Jackson City Hall two weeks ago at just after 7 p.m., you would have seen the mayor's chief of staff, Safiya Omari, in a tense, loud exchange with public defender Adofo Minka, who had just criticized Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba publicly on how he is handling officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>The capital city has had two fatal officer-involved shootings this year alone, with seven total shootings by police since the mayor took office in July. The Jackson Police Department has a longstanding practice of withholding those officers' names.</p>

<p>During public comments at the March 27 city council meeting, Minka, who is also an occasional columnist for the Jackson Free Press, pressured the mayor to clarify his position on releasing names of officers who shoot civilians. Earlier that day, the mayor had signed an executive order to create a task force to evaluate how the City will handle transparency in officer-involved shootings moving forward, but Minka wanted to know more.</p>

<p>"I'm not asking where a task force stands," Minka said then. "I'm asking you as the mayor of the City of Jackson right now where you stand."</p>

<p>The two men have a history dating back to the early days of both men's legal careers, and Minka has been active in the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, which the mayor's father helped start. In response to Minka, Lumumba said he had heard from both sides of the argument, but that the process needed to move beyond him.</p>

<p>"[I]f it was just Chokwe that had to make the decision based on his personal views, then I would release them," the mayor said. "But I also give people opportunity for a democratic process...."</p>

<p>"To be clear, you're bringing government bureaucracy to the table through a task force," Minka shouted back, as he turned to walk out of the chambers. City Council President Charles Tillman of Ward 5 struck his gavel. "That's not the people," Minka added.</p>

<p>The rift between the mayor and Minka is not the only fracture over policing the mayor faces. As Lumumba looks for consensus over how the City handles officer-involved shootings, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore's department wants to leave things where they are, with officers asking the community to support JPD.</p>

<p>'Luxury of Anonymity'</p>

<p>Chief Moore walked into the meeting room at JPD headquarters in a light-blue oxford, gray slacks, an olive-green tie and his gun on his waist on March 27. Nearly a dozen officers filed in behind him, standing shoulder to shoulder behind the podium where Moore stood to address the room.</p>

<p>The day before that meeting, a message went up on the NextDoor neighborhood website warning that the City might force JPD to release officer names within 72 hours of cop-involved shootings—a nationally recommended standard used in many cities. The post encouraged concerned community members to show up to the precinct meeting to support JPD.</p>

<p>Moore addressed a mixed-race crowd that nodded and sounded off in agreement whenever anyone brought up officer safety. He said wanted to learn about how people feel about the practice, and yielded to Paul Hobson, the president of the Jackson Police Officer Association, the labor union that represents JPD officers. Hobson said Jackson's small size means the officers do not have the "luxury of anonymity" like some of the larger cities do—a reason the police union does not believe in releasing names.</p>

<p>"I can tell you and assure you that 100 percent of our department is against the release of officer names as it pertains to shootings," Hobson said. "We believe that there should be transparency in the process ... but we do not believe that it is in the best practice to release names." Hobson is a member of the new officer-identification task force.</p>

<p>Deputy Chief Tyrone Buckley seconded what Hobson said about anonymity because his kids go to Jackson Public Schools, he said, adding that JPD has made progress by working with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>"Just recently, we elected MBI to come in and do all our officer-involved shootings. That adds another level of transparency," Buckley said.</p>

<p>The bureau has stepped in to investigate the last officer-involved shooting that claimed the life of Lee Edward Bonner in February. It is also investigating an officer-involved shooting by Flowood police at a Kroger there.</p>

<p>Buckley tried to make the case that crime suspects in Jackson are not plastered throughout the press, which is actually a standard practice in this City throughout different types of media. He said that if officers' names went out following an officer-involved shooting, the "officer could be convicted way before going before a jury of his peers."</p>

<p>National experts acknowledge that officers can be in danger after shooting someone on the job, but call for balancing that concern with the public's right to know. "If (departments) are coming out, and they're saying, 'we've got to protect our officers,' and they're not talking about what the cost is to community trust, that's probably not someone who's balancing the right set of things," Philip Atiba Goff, president of the Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College in New York, said in March.</p>

<p>The room agreed with Buckley, and throughout the meeting, people asked officers how they could support them further. Keyshia Sanders of constituent services, who represented the mayor's office, encouraged them to speak before the council that night. Only one woman did, however.</p>

<p>Thin Blue Line</p>

<p>Susan Lunardini, wearing a baby yellow sweater, stood up at the precinct meeting to talk about the importance of law enforcement. As a Jackson resident, business owner and former president of the Jackson Police Foundation, she expressed concern that releasing officer names would gravely affect recruiting, and also might incite violence from families of loved ones shot by JPD.</p>

<p>"I greatly feel for the victims' families," she said. "I know they want information, it's the first thing you want. ... But vengeance is in the heart of some people when they're in grief, and it just is a dangerous emotion until you have time to work through it." Lunardini was one of the only people to mention families of people who JPD has shot. Later that night, Lunardini spoke at city hall just before Minka. "I want to see that thin blue line we have get thicker and longer. It's just what gives us civilization," she said.</p>

<p>Minka feels the opposite. "When we have a situation where people's human rights can be abused and officers can skirt being identified, you have a police-state situation," Minka said before the council.</p>

<p>With clear polarity between the mayor's personal views and JPD, but also citizens like Minka and Lunardini, the 21-person task-force will have to pack a lot into their bi-monthly meetings beginning April 11.</p>

<p>Six of them are law-enforcement officers.</p>

<p>As soon as Gov. Phil Bryant signs legislation reauthorizing the Jackson Convention and Visitors Bureau, Lumumba will have 90 days to confirm six members to the board that technically controls the actions of JCVB. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>There's a modern-day adage that is good advice for the Lumumba administration: "Stay ready so you don't have to get ready." As we get to the one-year mark of Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba's time as mayor, it is clear that he has not tended to all the regular business of the city. Take the unfilled school board, the lackluster and even retroactive "fight" for the zoo, and the out-of-compliance Jackson Convention and Visitors Bureau (see page 7).</p>

<p>We applaud the mayor for reaching a needed compromise to avoid a state takeover of the Jackson Public School District. However, Ward 3 has gone without a school-board member for more than four months, while the rest of the board has been seated since November. Is he waiting for the six-member board to reach an impasse with an evenly split vote to realize the dire need for a seventh member, especially with the superintendent search?</p>

<p>Early in his term, Lumumba sat down with the leadership of the Jackson Zoo to hear their concerns, and they felt hopeful at that time. Fast forward to late March, and the zoo has decided to pack up and leave west Jackson. The mayor just announced a press conference for April 11 about keeping the zoo where it is, but it might be too late—the executive director of the zoo, Beth Poff, is already envisioning her new zoo elsewhere with donor support after years of failed promises to revive the area around the current one. This last-ditch effort to save the zoo is reactive rather than proactive.</p>

<p>In December, the mayor and the JCVB ping-ponged blame over who was responsible for proposing an increased 2-percent tax to fund the bureau that was up for legislative reauthorization. The city council rejected the heightened tax, and meanwhile, members are still sitting on the board with expired terms, and the mayor is responsible for those nominations needed to comply with the law.</p>

<p>As soon as Gov. Phil Bryant signs legislation reauthorizing the Jackson Convention and Visitors Bureau, Lumumba will have 90 days to confirm six members to the board that technically controls the actions of JCVB. We encourage the mayor to appoint these members promptly and quickly and fill that remaining school-board position. Ten months in, it is time for the administration to get organized, become proactive and plan ahead on all fronts.</p>

<h2 id="opinionmississippiwomensactivistberniesanderscantcometothecookout">OPINION: Mississippi Women's Activist—Bernie Sanders Can't Come to the Cookout</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Laurie Bertram Roberts</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-04</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/apr/04/opinion-mississippi-womens-activistbernie-sanders-/ </p>

<p>U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent politician from Vermont, came to Canton in March to support some Nissan workers' effort to unionize, which failed. He routinely emphasizes economic "class" issues over racism, which turns off many black voters. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>When the run-up to the 2016 primary season started, I was so ready to feel the Bern, y'all. I wasn't a Hillary stan even though I loved her in the '90s as a young woman. What I didn't like as a feminist was being told to support her due to our shared gender without knowing her specific platforms. I was feeling Bernie.</p>

<p>Yet some people can't be invited to the cookout. They just can't. They might sound like they are kinda down but then they open their mouth a few too many times, and there it is—nonsense just flows freely from their lips like water over Niagara falls. Bernie cannot come to the cookout. Sorry, not sorry.</p>

<p>It is also why Bernie Sanders shouldn't come to any Martin Luther King Jr. memorial events in Jackson, such as tonight's town hall with Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba. Sanders has no place here, certainly not as a featured speaker. Before someone thinks I'm saying this simply because he's white, that's not why. But it does inform how I came to this conclusion because his privilege as a white man (yes, I know he's Jewish) informs how he moves in the world.</p>

<p>Shortly before his death, MLK launched the Poor People's Campaign, envisioning it as a multiracial coalition to combat poverty. He understood that poverty, while impacting racial groups, differently cuts across all societal groups. What MLK never did that Bernie Sanders has repeatedly done is say that class concerns override racial issues. That isn't true. The Poor People's Campaign recognized that simply in the way it was designed to work—as a coalition of voices with shared goals.</p>

<p>A coalition means I can come to the table and be fully present as a black woman with needs and concerns for my community. So, too, can every other community, and we all move forward together with everyone's needs in mind. What it doesn't mean is doing what Bernie has done repeatedly—throwing people of color under the bus in order to make white voters comfortable by denouncing "identity politics" and saying that racism didn't really influence white Trump voters. It was just "economic anxiety," he tells us.</p>

<p>It doesn't mean appeasing those who think abortion is icky by saying it's OK to be flexible on abortion rights. They are rights; what is there to be flexible about? There is no economic justice without racial justice and reproductive justice.</p>

<p>There is also no economic justice without safe communities that have fewer guns on our streets. Most of us in Jackson, including black gun owners like myself, know that but Bernie Sanders has been iffy about gun-control measures as black families have been victims of gun violence grieving and marching for our dead loved ones for decades.</p>

<p>Sanders needs to make up his mind if he's "in for a penny in for a pound" as the elders say. So far he's just playing the hokey pokey with social justice and, frankly, black people and especially black women don't need any more white so-called allies who do that.</p>

<p>Martin Luther King Jr. was many things but he was never a man who was flexible about human rights. He died working for economic and racial justice. He certainly wasn't a man who didn't understand intersectionality even before we had a word for it. The Poor People's Campaign is an intersectional vision.</p>

<p>Bernie Sanders' so-called "revolution" of mostly white people is not any such thing. As I write this, I am confused and insulted that our city and our mayor whom I've supported would bring this man to honor one of the most revered black leaders in our history. We're supposed to believe that Bernie Sanders has insight on the economic legacy and vision of Martin Luther King Jr. when he doesn't even understand the racism of white people and intersectionality?</p>

<p>I'm not here for it.</p>

<p>This town hall isn't special; they are taking the usual Bernie town hall and putting Martin Luther King's name on it. It's glaringly obvious, offensive and frankly it is just gross. This is especially true as our city is still refusing to address state-sanctioned violence in the form of a long string of police shootings since last summer with the mayor and police chief, so far, refusing to reveal the officers' identity or other specifics.</p>

<p>Jackson, let's really talk about economic justice and how it's tied to reproductive justice, gender justice, disability justice, racial justice, birth justice and criminal-justice reform. Otherwise, the discussion is incomplete. Bernie Sanders isn't the person who can have that conversation. He gets no invite to the cookout, none.</p>

<p>Laurie Bertram Roberts is a grassroots reproductive-justice activist, full spectrum doula and writer based in Jackson. She is the co-founder and executive director of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Cries of "Bernie 2020!" accented the conversation between U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba at a town hall on economic justice 50 years to the night since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis.</p>

<p>Thalia Mara Hall in downtown Jackson hosted the predominantly white audience, mostly Sanders supporters in T-shirts with slogans like "Feel the Bern" or even one that said "Don't Blame Me I Voted for Bernie," among other paraphernalia with Sanders' face on it. Some arrived an hour before the doors officially opened at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>Sanders told the crowd that he had come to Mississippi because he believes the Democratic Party has to become a 50-state party, which prompted enormous cheers from the crowd.</p>

<p>In line with the theme, Sanders said King was his "major political inspiration," and that he resonates with the work for economic justice King did toward the end of his life.</p>

<p>"You have got to ask yourselves ... how it could be that in this great country with so much wealth, we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on earth? Bad for whites, much worse for African Americans," Sanders said. "How could it be that we are the only major country not to guarantee healthcare to all people—," but the cheering crowd didn't let him finish.</p>

<p>Sanders picked back up saying that Dr. King taught us to have a bold vision and to move the country forward to create the America the late hero envisioned.</p>

<p>Race, and Also Class </p>

<p>Hours before the town hall, Sanders was in Memphis for the "I Am 2018" rally and events throughout the city where King took his last breaths after a white assassin shot him on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel. King had gone to Memphis in 1968 to support a sanitation workers' strike after two black men, Echol Cole and Robert Walker, had been crushed in a faulty trash truck.</p>

<p>Less than two weeks later, black men from the public works department in Memphis went on strike to fight poor wages that left many of them on welfare and food stamps and working on dangerously malfunctioning trucks.</p>

<p>King stepped in to help, as the mission of this strike directly supported his Poor People's Campaign for economic justice. With hesitation, King went back to Memphis on April 3 and spoke before sanitation workers there, delivering his final and now iconic speech, "I've Been to the Mountaintop." He was killed the next day.</p>

<p>The Memphis sanitation strike in 1968 was inextricably linked to race, and therefore class because black people were second-class citizens still. Sanders described it without including that important nuance, or the race of the sanitation workers, which often draws him criticism.</p>

<p>"All of us know where he was when he was assassinated 50 years ago today," Sanders said. "He was in Memphis to stand with low-income sanitation workers who were being exploited ruthlessly, whose wages were abysmally low and were trying to create a union."</p>

<p>Racial inequality in Memphis is still real 50 years later. 2015 U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission statistics say white people in Memphis held 88 percent of senior-level management and executive positions, while more than 70 percent of labor workers and service workers were black. In the 2010 census, Memphis ranked sixth out of 10 American cities with the largest number of black people.</p>

<p>Those same 2015 EEO numbers show that white executive/senior-level officials and managers in Jackson make up more than 86 percent of those positions, while black people only represent 12 percent of those roles, despite Jackson being nearly 80 percent black.</p>

<p>As Lumumba pointed out, economic injustice in Jackson, and the entire state is prevalent, too.</p>

<p>"The Wednesday after Donald Trump was elected, I woke up in Jackson, Mississippi," Lumumba said. "And what that means to me is no matter whether Donald Trump is the president, to be honest no matter whether Barack Obama, Bill Clinton or George Bush, we've always been at the bottom.</p>

<p>"Jackson, Mississippi, or Mississippi as a state, no matter whether the country is experiencing great booms or busts in terms of its economy, we are always at the bottom. And so what is apparent to me is that we have to begin to rescue ourselves," Lumumba added.</p>

<p>'Charismatic' Obama and a 'Big Giant Redneck'</p>

<p>Sanders also evoked President Barack Obama's name in a comment that some on social media took to be offensive because they felt the senator downplayed America's first black president in an event meant to honor another black leader.</p>

<p>"The business model, if you like, of the Democratic Party for the last 15 years or so, has been a failure," Sanders said in response to a question about how to harness millennial energy in efforts to reimagine the Democratic Party in Jackson and beyond.</p>

<p>"[P]eople sometimes don't see that because there was a charismatic individual named Barack Obama who won the presidency in 2008 and 2012. He was obviously an extraordinary candidate, brilliant guy. But, behind that reality, over the last 10 years, Democrats have lost about 1,000 seats in state legislatures all across this country," Sanders added.</p>

<p>This was not Sanders' first trip to this area. In 2017, Sanders came to Canton, Miss., in support of the polarizing efforts to unionize Nissan plant workers there—a campaign that ultimately failed with more than 62 percent of workers voting against the union.</p>

<p>However, from the union T-shirts with Sanders on them and long-time union leaders like Johnnie Smith, 54, a white Mississippian who voted for Sanders in the primaries, last night made it clear that the 2017 loss didn't ice "the Bern" for many people.</p>

<p>Smith was one of the first to arrive at the town hall in cowboy boots, a John Deere trucker hat, a denim jacket over a black button-up shirt tucked into jeans held up with an American flag belt buckle. He gets frustrated that people often mistake him for a Republican or Trump supporter, when, in actuality, he voted for Hillary Clinton "when it counted," but initially supported Sanders because of his economic-justice campaign.</p>

<p>"They look at me as a big giant redneck, and it's probably true. But, I grew up in the sticks and poor. Trade unions helped me to get out of poverty," Smith told the Jackson Free Press. He came to the town hall to hear some progressive voices—a welcome change to what he calls, "the conservative junk that you hear day in and day out."</p>

<h2 id="yesdrkinghowcanihelpyoublackrightsleadersrecallmlk">'Yes, Dr. King, How Can I Help You?': Black Rights Leaders Recall MLK</h2>

<p>James Meredith, Flonzie Brown-Wright and Charles McLaurin spoke about their experiences with Martin Luther King Jr. on Wednesday, April 4, at the 2 Mississippi Museums. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Flonzie Brown-Wright first met Martin Luther King Jr. over the phone. She lived in Canton and got a phone call from King himself three days before the participants in the March Against Fear in 1966 got to Canton on their march from Memphis.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dr. King how can I help you?" Brown-Wright recalled answering the phone.</p>

<p>"Can you provide housing and food for 3,000 people?" King had said.</p>

<p>"Without giving it a thought. Without wondering 'Should I?' 'Could I?'...'Why me,' I said to him, 'Y,es I can.' And when I hung up the phone, my knees knocked. I got very nervous, but I knew I could do it. I knew I could do it because Canton was so together," Brown-Wright said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The marchers came to Canton and registered lots of black residents to vote, and Brown-Wright, who later became the first African American woman in Mississippi to hold public office as an election commissioner, recalled seeing thousands of marchers sleeping in yards, homes and gyms in Canton. She also remembered King sitting down with a dozen Mississippians in Canton before completing the march to Jackson.</p>

<p>"I sat at his feet, while he shared with us, 'My days are numbered. I won't be with you very long. The freedom movement, the Civil Rights Movement, is not about Martin King, it's about you. If the movement dies with me, it was never about me,'" Brown-Wright said Wednesday.</p>

<p>"He asked 12 local people that day to make him a promise that as long as we lived, as long as we saw racism, as long as we saw segregation, separation, that we would call it out for what it is. That we would confront it for what it is, but also try and find a remedy to be able to make the lives of people better—not just black folk people, brown people, tan people, red, yellow, black and white," she continued.</p>

<p>Brown-Wright, Charles McLaurin and James Meredith spoke at the 2 Mississippi Museums on Wednesday to commemorate the 50th anniversary of King's death and reflect on how his work affected them personally.</p>

<p>McLaurin, who was active in the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, shared a story about playing touch football with King in Georgia during Southern Christian Leadership Conference training.</p>

<p>"I got a chance down there during the break one day to play touch football with Dr. King. ... Bernard Lee, John Lewis and others who were down there ... and I didn't really think much about that until a few days ago," he said on Wednesday, remembering his time in Dorchester, Ga.</p>

<p>McLaurin, a Jackson native, joined SNCC after hearing King speak and meeting him in Jackson in 1961. McLaurin went on to work with SNCC, registering black Mississippians to vote and working with Fannie Lou Hamer on her Congress run and political campaign.</p>

<p>"I was so amazed and elated over the fact that the guy could stand up and just let kind of words flow from his mouth," McLaurin said. "And he's talking about things of significance that I had read about in history books."</p>

<p>In 1968, McLaurin spent some time with King in the Delta, three weeks before his assassination. King was pulling together the Poor People's Campaign at that time, McLaurin said, and he drove him to catch his plane outside of Clarksdale back to Atlanta. King was assassinated outside the Lorraine Motel in Memphis a few weeks later on April 4, 1968.</p>

<p>Meredith, who famously integrated the University of Mississippi in 1962, also led the March Against Fear in 1966. He was shot and wounded along the route from Memphis to Jackson, but black-freedom organizations rallied in response, completing the march and detouring through the Delta. It was during that march route that Stokely Carmichael was thrown in jail for trying to set up a tent for marchers in the Delta. McLaurin said they helped get Carmichael out of jail; they had to set up the tent in a park in the middle of the black Delta community.</p>

<p>McLaurin recalled Carmichael stepping up to the stage, famously saying, "'We have no power. Black people have no power. ... We need some black power.'"</p>

<p>As the March Against Fear continued, the marchers worked to register African American Mississippians to vote as they went along—eventually staying in Canton with Brown Wright's community.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi's Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a woman has parental rights to a 6-year-old boy born to her ex-wife when the two were married, in a case watched by gay rights activists and groups aiding in vitro fertilization.</p>

<p>Christina "Chris" Strickland brought the appeal, challenging a lower court decision that an anonymous sperm donor still had parental rights and that Strickland did not. Strickland ultimately hopes to win 50-50 custody of Zayden Strickland, who bears her last name and was born by Kimberly Day through artificial means when Day and Strickland were married.</p>

<p>"I'm on cloud nine right now," Strickland said by phone. "I knew I was my son's mother from the start and I would be at the end and this just confirms it with the Supreme Court backing me 100 percent."</p>

<p>All nine justices, in a series of separate opinions, found flaws in the original ruling by Rankin County Chancery Judge John Grant III, which favored a sperm donor over Stickland. The case was ordered back to Grant for further proceedings to decide on custody of Zayden Strickland, with orders to treat Christina Strickland as an equal co-parent.</p>

<p>"At bottom, to deny Christina the relationship she has built with Z.S. would be a miscarriage of justice," Associate Justice David Ishee wrote for a four-judge plurality.</p>

<p>The justices found that Grant's ruling that the unknown sperm donor had parental rights and that Strickland did not was unworkable and unfair, saying such a standard would "would disrupt the familial relationships and expectations of Mississippians who have conceived children" using artificial insemination.</p>

<p>"For one, it would elevate the rights of a donor — who is a complete stranger to the child, and likely never will be identified — over the rights of a person who has known and cared for the child," Ishee wrote.</p>

<p>The original judge had granted Strickland visitation rights and she pays child support. But Attorney Beth Littrell, who works for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Strickland had a much inferior status to legal parenthood.</p>

<p>Day's lawyer argued that sperm and egg donors should have legal rights and that when a child is conceived through artificial means, a second parent is more akin to someone who is adopting a child. The lawyer, Prentiss Grant, had argued Strickland should have gone through the legal process of terminating the sperm donor's parental rights during the divorce proceeding.</p>

<p>Grant didn't immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment late Thursday.</p>

<p>Justices wrote that a ruling for Day could have allowed another adult to adopt Zayden Strickland, and if Day had died as the sole parent, Zayden Strickland could have ended up as an orphan in state custody. A ruling against Strickland could have meant that opposite-sex couples who use someone else's eggs or sperm would have had to terminate donors' parental rights to achieve legal status.</p>

<p>Some justices said the court was going too far, ruling on a legal principle that wasn't argued in the original trial or saying they should order Grant to basically start the case over.</p>

<p>Chief Justice William Waller Jr., who provided a key fifth vote agreeing with the outcome of the four-justice opinion, wrote separately that Mississippi lawmakers needed to clarify state law.</p>

<p>"The Legislature should speak directly to the recognition of the legal status of children born during a marriage as the result of assisted reproductive technology," Waller wrote.</p>

<p>Littrell said she was also pleased that no Mississippi justices opposed Strickland because of same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>In a 2015 opinion where the Mississippi Supreme Court granted a divorce to lesbian couple, two of its justices questioned the U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage and suggested that its landmark ruling has no constitutional basis. One of those justices has since retired.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Closing arguments are set in a federal trial in which inmates say they live in unsanitary and excessively violent conditions in a Mississippi prison.</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union and Southern Poverty Law Center argue the conditions at East Mississippi Correctional Facility are unconstitutionally abusive. The state's lawyers say the prison conditions are acceptable, and many of the prisoners' problems are self-inflicted.</p>

<p>Closing arguments are expected Monday.</p>

<p>The state prison is operated privately under a contract with the Utah-based Management and Training Corps.</p>

<p>Inmates have testified to U.S. District Judge William Barbour Jr. that they live in poor conditions with inadequate health care.</p>

<p>Warden Frank Shaw has testified that the prison followed state and company protocol and the facility has no worse conditions than other correctional facilities.</p>

<h2 id="mississippioutslegalimmigrantsondriverslicenses">Mississippi Outs Legal Immigrants on Drivers' Licenses</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-04</p>

<p id="url">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/apr/04/mississippi-outs-legal-immigrants-licenses/ </p>

<p>Mississippi has a policy that brands immigrants’ driver licenses with the words “Non-US Citizen” despite the fact that they must present proof that they are in the U.S. legally to get the I.D. Photo courtesy Abigail Pena Mandujano</p>

<p>JACKSON — Abigail Piña Mandujano had to start carrying her visa with her when she drives because her license is not enough to fend off questions from law-enforcement officials at roadblocks, she says. That's because "Non-US Citizen Driver License" is emblazoned on Mandujano's Mississippi driver's license in red letters.</p>

<p>"[D]own here we have a lot of roadblocks, and the officers will question me, and I've had to actually start carrying my visa because some of them will ask for it," Mandujano, who lives in Blue Springs, told the Jackson Free Press recently.</p>

<p>Mandujano is not a U.S. citizen, but she is in the country legally. She has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, meaning her parents brought her to the U.S. as a young child. She has lived in the U.S. for 18 years since her family came from Mexico City when she was 3 years old. When she turned 18 in 2013, she went to get her driver's license and found that she and fellow DACA immigrants had different licenses than their other Mississippi friends.</p>

<p>Licensing for immigrants varies in different states, but Mandujano said her friends in other states do not carry licenses labeled that way.</p>

<p>Amelia McGowan, an immigration attorney at the Catholic Charities Migrant Support Center in Jackson, said she is unaware of another state with the "Non-US Citizen" demarcation on the license.</p>

<p>"We have a number of clients who apply for driver's licenses," McGowan said. "You have to have immigration status ... to get a driver's license, so if you are undocumented you cannot get a license in the Mississippi."</p>

<p>That's the unique part of Mississippi's policy. The "Non US Citizen" could imply that a documented immigrant is not in the U.S. illegally, although undocumented immigrants cannot obtain a driver's license at all.</p>

<p>"If you are a non-U.S. citizen, you must meet all other requirements for obtaining an operator's license or identification card except for providing a Social Security card," the DPS website says. To get a license, an immigrant must present valid immigration papers, a birth certificate that is translated by a state-run university or an approved translator, passport and other proof of residency.</p>

<p>The license is good for the amount of time an immigrant's visa or papers allow her to stay.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press obtained the Department of Public Safety's "Out-of Country and Non US Citizens License and ID Applicants policy, which was most recently updated in November 2013. The policy shows that the "Non US Citizen" demarcation is required. "All applicants who are Non US Citizens must be issued a credential marked 'Non-US Citizen,'" it states.</p>

<p>It is unclear how long this has been the policy of DPS or the purpose for this specific designation on an immigrant license. The Department of Public Safety did not respond to repeated interview requests from the Jackson Free Press about the policy or its purpose.</p>

<p>Bad Impressions</p>

<p>Mandujano is attending Itawamba Community College and wants to transfer to the University of Mississippi eventually. But as a non-U.S. citizen, she does not qualify for state financial aid for school, so she works to pay for her education. Some states have changed their laws to allow DACA recipients to receive financial aid for college. In Mississippi, Rep. Kathy Sykes, D-Jackson, introduced a similar measure this year, but it got little traction in a Republican-supermajority statehouse that passed legislation banning "sanctuary cities" statewide.</p>

<p>After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress passed the "Real ID Act" requiring states to upgrade and intensify their I.D.s. This meant a mix of policy changes in different states pertaining to immigrants. The Connecticut state government recently created a drive-only license that allows undocumented immigrants to at least drive around the fairly rural state, Kara Hart, an immigration attorney there, said.</p>

<p>"[I]f someone is stopped for whatever reason, at least they are not going to be cited for driving without for a license, so that removes an enormous worry from people who are driving particularly in places where you may not have access," Hart said.</p>

<p>Hart said Mississippi's licensing law is different than other states that she has looked at because the "Non US Citizen" licenses include immigrants who are lawfully present. While Connecticut's drive-only licenses might be an obvious sign to law-enforcement officers that the person is undocumented, a "Non US Citizen" license in Mississippi gives no such impression—in theory.</p>

<p>In practice, however, Mandujano is asked about her immigration status regularly despite being in the country legally, she says.</p>

<p>"They start questioning, 'well, why are you here if you're not legal?' And I think a lot of people don't understand that you can be legal but not a citizen, so you've got all these questions coming," she says. Such instances happen in Walmart or at roadblocks when she shows her Mississippi license.</p>

<p>"Even if you are legal here ... a lot of DACA recipients still live in the shadows, even though we are legal," she continued. "... It's a huge load to carry when people already have a bad impression of immigrants.</p>

<p>In the music world, self-titled albums are common, and self-titled songs are less so. Having two self-titled songs on the same album—well, that is an anomaly. But then again, Justin Scott, better known as hip-hop artist Big K.R.I.T., says that he has always felt like a bit of an anomaly.</p>

<p>It is a feeling that has long been present in his work, from the space-inspired cover art, atmospheric sounds, but also in the meta-narrative behind his music. It is a story that is still unfolding, he says.</p>

<p>The Meridian, Miss., native announced in the summer of 2016 that he had split from Def Jam Records after about six years with the legendary label. Rather than seeking out a new contract with another major label, though, Scott decided to use the opportunity to officially launch his own label, Multi Alumni. More than that, he says that he wanted to take time and create his most personal and expansive recording project yet.</p>

<p>In late October 2017, after about two and a half years of working on the project, Scott put out his third studio album as Big K.R.I.T., "4eva Is a Mighty Long Time," a 22-track double album that centered on his duality as an entertainer and as a real person.</p>

<p>Scott is currently on the road promoting the album through the "Heavy Is the Crown" national tour, which brings him to the capital city on Thursday, April 5. The Jackson Free Press recently spoke with him over the phone about the process of tackling two sides of himself on "4eva Is a Mighty Long Time," and taking the reins of his career as an artist, producer and executive.</p>

<p>What made you decide it was time for a new album as opposed to another mixtape?</p>

<p>I would say because, you know, mixtapes are what I've done. I obviously have a lot more mixtapes than I do albums, and I just had been gone for so long. It was like two and a half years, and I think I did (mixtape) "It's Better This Way" and "#12FOR12," which was also pretty much a mixtape, too. But I just didn't think a tape was how I needed to start off.</p>

<p>In the end, I had been recording so many songs, and I think it was also just that time for me where I really wanted to do a double album. I'd always wanted to do one. I think I actually wanted "Live from the Underground" (his 2012 album) to be one, but we just couldn't, just with the label and budgets and stuff.</p>

<p>So this one, I was like, "I'm free. I can do exactly what I want to." We decided to make it a double. I've always had a hard time sequencing records because I'd have the trunk-rattling, aggressive car-slab music, and then I'd have a song that was more pertaining to how I was feeling at the time, maybe like "The Vent" or something like that, where it breaks up the entire album. It's like an abrupt stop sonically on the low, so it was like, "Well, how do I raise people's spirits again?"</p>

<p>With this album, I decided to really tell my story, the duality of me. On one album, I could go be super hip-hop, rapper, superhero vibe, and then the Justin Scott side could be how I feel at home. It could have those elements of, sometimes, the insecurity, the doubt, the depression, the anxiety, but how I keep my faith together in a record like "Mixed Messages," where sometimes we all have confusing messages that we send out.</p>

<p>It's a blessing because I think we're at a place where everyone is starting to realize that there's a lot going on in society, a lot of social topics, and the presidential aspect. There's just so much going on. It gave me the opportunity to speak my truth, and people were ready to embrace it. It's been an amazing journey thus far.</p>

<p>When you have that defined split in terms of tone and lyrics, how do you also communicate that duality in the music?</p>

<p>Thank God that I actually produce, too, because sonically I could tell off the bat what made more sense. A record like "Drinking Sessions," being so stripped-down and the piano chords and the blues horns, ... the elements of that record sounded like "Justin Scott" to me. It didn't necessarily sound like hip-hop. It sounded like something else.</p>

<p>Even the intro to "Justin Scott," and I worked with DJ Khalil on that record, and it was important that I didn't rap on it because when I'm at home, as a music lover, I just love soul music, so I play records that I have nothing to do with and just vibe out. I wanted that to kind of (show) how I listen to music at home.</p>

<p>A lot of people don't even realize that I sampled the "Justin Scott" intro for the "Big K.R.I.T." intro and then rap on the "Big K.R.I.T." intro because that's what I do. That's what people know me for.</p>

<p>But just sonically, "Price of Fame" would not have worked on the "Big K.R.I.T." side. "Mixed Messages" would not have worked on the "Big K.R.I.T." side because it would have diluted everything on that side had it been on it. But it makes so much sense on the "Justin Scott" side because it's more vulnerable. It's the transparent part of me.</p>

<p>And I've always been this way, but you put that face on, that mask on, to go out in the world and be able to deal with the negativity and to try to embrace positivity. Then, you get back home and deal with all that. There might be one comment while you're at home, and it makes you question everything.</p>

<p>Try watching this video on www.youtube.com, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.</p>

<p>When you're putting not just your name as an artist but your name as a person on the album, you're kind of saying, "This represents all of me." Was that difficult for you?</p>

<p>Yeah, just a tad bit because you still leave yourself out there people to be like, "Mm, I don't like that vibe, and mm, I don't like that vibe. I would rather you rap about candy-paint (metallic finish) and cars," you know what I'm saying?" [Laughs] Like, "Oh, no. We don't want to be sad." ... But I think about a lot of old-school artists. I think about the Bobby Womacks, the Curtis Mayfields, Al Green, Willie Hutch and all these people. When they were doing these songs, I don't think they were much concerned about what people think about the songs as much as, "I have to tell you about this. I have to speak on this."</p>

<p>I had to look at it from that perspective. If people don't get it now, then maybe when they're 40, 50, 60—Lord willing, people still listen to my music—they'll go back and something will resonate with them. That's what timeless music is. And I have to grow as an artist.</p>

<p>After Big K.R.I.T., a Meridian native and hip-hop artist, announced that he had split from Def Jam Records in 2016, he decided to officially launch his own record label, Multi Alumni. Photo courtesy Joshua Kissi</p>

<p>If the people who listen to me aren't there yet ... or maybe don't recognize anxiety yet, or maybe they feel like they're not abusing their vice or they don't understand what that may be doing to them, then maybe when they do get to that point, my song will make more sense, and it'll be helpful to them to know, "I went through it, too. I understand, and we can relate."</p>

<p>Once I started to look at it from that perspective, it made it so much easier to put my government name on my album. But it's also made it easy to do interviews. We have conversations like this, and like a lot of the radio people that I've talked to, they've also gone through depression. The room opens up, and we start having conversations that aren't surface, you know? It's a beautiful experience, man.</p>

<p>Your fans might recognize the connection between the titles of "4eva Is a Mighty Long Time" and several of your past releases, including "Return of 4eva" and "4eva N a Day." What's the reason for that?</p>

<p>Well, all of my albums have a story I'm telling, and I have no idea how it's going to end. [Laughs] But it started with "K.R.I.T. Wuz Here" (his 2010 album) even, that idea of more of an alien perspective or a being somewhere, and letting people know that I've been there, I've done this, or I'm a part of this whether you realize it or not. Then, going to "Return of 4Eva," and that having still more of an outer-space experience to it, trying to take people somewhere.</p>

<p>I think some of that comes with me being from Meridian, Mississippi, and sometimes feeling so much like an outsider. I always felt like I needed to bring people to where I was from and having this more outcast, alien perspective when I do go out, because I know that, "OK. People may not be as familiar with where I'm from or have never been. I've got to take them there."</p>

<p>And you know, I love sci-fi. I think outer space is the only place we all look at in awe, the stars and the planets, and there's just this mystery behind it.</p>

<p>So creating my albums, even "4eva Is a Mighty Long Time," I'm still giving it that space where it fits with "Return of 4eva" and fits with "4eva N a Day," which was the first (release) where I really showed people that I had two sides—that album cover with the little boy, the church being on the left side and a strip club on the right, the Bible on his left but the bottle on the right, and having to deal with that.</p>

<p>So I've always been putting that in my music. I just think this is the first time I could materialize it with two different albums and really be playing with exactly what the album is about and even show it with the album cover.</p>

<p>I've never been the type of person to put my face on album covers, so this was the first time that I was like, "No, I have to put my face. I have to show the energy and how it's different."</p>

<p>This is also your first release through your label, Multi Alumni. What was the experience like having to be both an artist and an executive on this album?</p>

<p>Scary! [Laughs] It was scary at first because it's the realization, "Ooh, the ball is in your court now," you know? But having the strong team that I have, my manager (Sheldon "Dutch" John) and (Steven "Steve-O" Brown of public-relations company GFCNY) on the marketing level, definitely helped.</p>

<p>These are people that I've been working with for years, and (they) have a really good understanding of what my vision has always been for my music and how to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>I've been branding Multi since 2005, right? But it's one of those things where 2010 is where we really started, and even when I was signed to Def Jam, I never stopped screaming Multi and never stopped building what that meant. If anything, that was something I had the opportunity to do while signed to a major (label) was continuously putting my brand at the forefront.</p>

<p>So once we left Def Jam, Multi was still there and active, and people know that it's not just about me, but it's about being a king or queen of whatever you do, and having to multi-task and play more than one position in life to ensure your success.</p>

<p>The fact that I produce, and I rap, and I can mix my own records and (engineer) my own records, it put me in a position where I could survive off music longer than most. And then, it puts us in a boss situation where I'll never sign as an artist (on another label). It can only be partnerships from this point on because now I have Multi.</p>

<p>Why did you decide to go through the process of launching Multi Alumni instead of trying to shop the album out to have another major record label to release it?</p>

<p>Well, we went through BMG (Rights Management for distribution), but the thing about the label, in most cases, is the way that you create music having a mind for business is very important because business can get in the way.</p>

<p>It can really affect how you are in the studio, affect the music or affect how you record. Even your delivery on a song can be affected by the people in the room and what they may be looking for.</p>

<p>I've spent a lot of time sitting down in a boardroom, playing my album for people and hoping that they got it. If they didn't get it, then you're kind of fighting an uphill battle at that point, you know? This is the first album where I just (said), "This is the album. Let's go."</p>

<p>It's not where you have to play it for a lot of people, and they go, "Well, this is going to be the single." I was like, "No. This is the single. These are the videos. This is the album cover. This is how it looks, and this is the feel. Let's go." And even better, it was like, "This is the date. This is when we drop it."</p>

<p>It just was a freedom where it's so crazy because I'm so used to always working. The deadlines are usually so short that you work clean up until the deadline, and then, you go on tour immediately.</p>

<p>This is the first time where I was done with the album, everything was getting pressed, everything was working, and I was like, "So what am I supposed to do? What do you need me to do?" I'm asking my manager who's like, "Just chill! I don't need nothing from you!" [Laughs]</p>

<p>What have you learned since putting out your last album, "Cadillactica," in 2014 that you wanted to apply to "4eva"?</p>

<p>Man, life—I started living a little more. I spend so much time in the studio, man, that I really wasn't going outside and just enjoying nature and wherever I was at and actually being in the moment.</p>

<p>I was always thinking about the next song. I was always thinking about the next move and musically what I could do differently, and trying to compete and chase accolades ... in between "Cadillactica," that tour, getting off the label and what that meant and felt like, almost going to a point where people almost forgot about me.</p>

<p>You know, I pretty much went broke doing the album because I was investing all my money into it without the label knowing. I wanted to finish it without asking for any budget or anything. And man, I realized that money doesn't make you happy, and I realized that I had been abusing my vice in different ways.</p>

<p>That was affecting my emotions and the people around me. And my lady (neo-soul artist and singer-songwriter Mara Hruby) was a very impactful person in my life because she would get me out of the studio, get me out of the house, and we'd go experience things, and we'd travel.</p>

<p>It just helped with getting back in the studio and helped with writing and being more vulnerable on songs when, normally, I would try to kind of deal with whatever I was dealing with in life and not write about it. But I definitely put it all in this album. "Drinking Sessions," I was going through something the day that I wrote that, and I recorded it as it was. People can hear it and feel that I was being genuine.</p>

<p>Even without chasing the accolades, "4eva" peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard 200, No. 5 on the R&amp;B/hip-hop albums chart, No. 4 on the rap albums chart and No. 2 on the independent albums chart. What was it like to see that kind of impact after working on it for so long?</p>

<p>It means that people still want to hear my music. It means that I wasn't wrong about taking this route, the road less traveled. It paid off. It builds a certain amount of confidence that people, you know, can always expect me to do my best and always try to grow and to not conform and fit into whatever the latest trend might be, either.</p>

<p>People don't necessarily come to me or listen to my music for that. I think they enjoy that I'm going to give them something a little different.</p>

<p>(It shows) that you can be 100-percent yourself and still crack those numbers, still get the radio support and still do the radio interviews and be able to perform onstage with other artists, get the tours and all that by just being yourself without having to be (about) the shock value.</p>

<p>The 2018 legislative session's story largely revolves around Republicans' inability to get a lot done due to failed negotiations between the House and the Senate. While a laundry list of bills died this session, lawmakers did manage to fund some critical needs in the state—albeit partially due to lawsuits filed against the state. The state's crime lab, foster-care system and the Department of Mental Health all remained either intact or received more funding to continue operations, and hopefully fend off additional litigation.</p>

<p>We applaud lawmakers for understanding the gravity of using taxpayer dollars to fend off lawsuits—that is, until they passed the 15-week abortion ban this session. Beyond passing that unnecessary law, which will cost taxpayer dollars to defend in federal court, lawmakers neglected several other critical needs this session. For example, infrastructure funding, which they claimed to be their focus at the start of this year, went nowhere.</p>

<p>The House passed several road and bridge measures in January, but the lieutenant governor did not respond or even act on them, opting to introduce his own plan in mid-February instead. Discussions seemed limited until deadlines began to close in, and then it all crumbled. Never mind the fact that both the House and Senate plans come nowhere close to the Mississippi Economic Council's recommendation of $375 million needed annually to restore the state's infrastructure. Reeves' plan claimed to be a "billion dollar" infrastructure plan, but large parts of that would just shift existing revenue for the Mississippi Department of Transportation or force municipalities to come up with more money.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the House plan might have reached the MEC recommendation if all the measures had passed together—and state tax-revenue collections did amazingly well in the next few years, which remains to be seen after all those tax cuts. What really needs to happen is a dialogue about raising the state's gas tax, which is as flat as ever, but with Republicans like Reeves up for re-election next year, that conversation is out of the question. Mississippians will have to wait until 2019 to voice their opinions at the ballot box about roads and bridges, with the knowledge that a supermajority doesn't necessarily mean productivity on the issue.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Jackson Police Department will implement a foot-patrol unit in downtown Jackson beginning Monday, April 2, under Interim Chief Anthony Moore's direction.</p>

<p>Sgt. Roderick Holmes, public information officer for JPD, told the Jackson Free Press that the department has had these units in the past, and it is something Moore wants to re-implement beginning in the downtown area. Holmes said the idea is to foster a police presence for crime deterrence, but to also create a positive policing relationship in a place many people frequent during the day.</p>

<p>"We have a lot of people obviously that live downtown, work downtown, and a lot of people that come from other parts of state, if not the country, and actually visit downtown," Holmes said. "So it's a pretty active and pretty pedestrian-oriented location within the city."</p>

<p>This downtown unit will work Monday through Friday during normal business hours when downtown Jackson is busiest, Holmes said, and in the future JPD hopes to include patrol bicycles. Holmes said JPD wants to implement foot patrols in other areas of the city, but at the present time, the department does not have the manpower to do so.</p>

<p>"The more officers you have, the more you can actually do, and the more emphasis you can put in certain areas," Holmes said. "Manpower does play a role or does have an impact on everything that we do here."</p>

<p>Holmes estimates that JPD currently has 350 sworn officers, give or take a few, and in the past, it has had as many as 500 officers. JPD is currently recruiting for a new class, and Holmes said that process is going well so far.</p>

<p>This new downtown unit comes less than a week after a Greenbrook Flowers experienced a series of break-ins. The owner, Gwen Dearman, says one man caused thousands of dollars worth of damage with at least five break-ins over the course of a week. On March 27, she told the Jackson City Council that the man was "stealing us blind" and had broken into the shop three times one Sunday alone.</p>

<p>Dearman pleaded with the council to do something to secure downtown, especially because her family's business has been on State Street since the 1960s and in Jackson for far longer than that.</p>

<p>"This is the reason people are leaving Jackson," Dearman said. "We have been here over 100 years ... and we want to stay. We love Jackson, but we can't afford to stay here if we keep being robbed this way."</p>

<p>Holmes said this new unit, announced two days after Dearman spoke in front of the council with members of JPD in attendance, is not a direct response to the Greenbrook break-ins. However, he hopes it will create relationships and also opportunity for people to contact an officer quickly if need be.</p>

<p>"If (people) see an officer out and about, by all means don't hesitate to interact with that officer," Holmes said. "[I]f they have any questions or anything whether it's law-related or otherwise, feel free to ask an officer."</p>
        
        
<h2 id="judgeseparatedfamiliesmustbereunitedwithin30days">Judge: Separated Families Must be Reunited Within 30 Days</h2>

<p>MCALLEN, Texas (AP) — A judge in California on Tuesday ordered U.S. border authorities to reunite separated families within 30 days, setting a hard deadline in a process that has so far yielded uncertainty about when children might again see their parents.</p>

<p>If children are younger than 5, they must be reunified within 14 days of the order issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego. Sabraw, an appointee of President George W. Bush, also issued a nationwide injunction on future family separations, unless the parent is deemed unfit or doesn't want to be with the child. He also requires the government provide phone contact between parents and their children within 10 days.</p>

<p>More than 2,000 children have been separated from their parents in recent weeks and placed in government-contracted shelters — hundreds of miles away, in some cases — under a now-abandoned policy toward families caught illegally entering the U.S.</p>

<p>Amid an international outcry, Trump last week issued an executive order to stop the separation of families and said parents and children will instead be detained together. A Department of Homeland Security statement over the weekend on reuniting families only seemed to sow more confusion.</p>

<p>"The facts set forth before the Court portray reactive governance_responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the Government's own making," Sabraw wrote. "They belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our Constitution."</p>

<p>The ruling was a win for the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit in March involving a 7-year-old girl who was separated from her Congolese mother and a 14-year-old boy who was separated from his Brazilian mother.</p>

<p>"Tears will be flowing in detention centers across the country when the families learn they will be reunited," said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt.</p>

<p>The Justice and Homeland Security Departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment late Tuesday.</p>

<p>It's not clear how border authorities will meet the deadline. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Congress on Tuesday that his department still has custody of 2,047 immigrant children separated from their parents at the border. That is only six fewer children than the number in HHS custody as of last Wednesday. Democratic senators said that wasn't nearly enough progress.</p>

<p>Under questioning, Azar refused to be pinned down on how long it will take to reunite families. He said his department does extensive vetting of parents to make sure they are not traffickers masquerading as parents.</p>

<p>Also challenging will be the requirement the judge set on phone contact.</p>

<p>At a Texas detention facility, immigrant advocates complained that parents have gotten busy signals or no answers from a 1-800 number provided by federal authorities to get information about their children.</p>

<p>Attorneys have spoken to about 200 immigrants at the Port Isabel detention facility near Los Fresnos, Texas, since last week, and only a few knew where their children were being held, said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia.</p>

<p>"The U.S. government never had any plan to reunite these families that were separated," Sandoval-Moshenberg said, and now it is "scrambling to undo this terrible thing that they have done."</p>

<p>A message left for HHS, which runs the hotline, was not immediately returned.</p>

<p>Many children in shelters in southern Texas have not had contact with their parents, though some have reported being allowed to speak with them in recent days, said Meghan Johnson Perez, director of the Children's Project for the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project, which provides free legal services to minors.</p>

<p>"Things might be changing now. The agencies are trying to coordinate better," she said. "But the kids we have been seeing have not been in contact with the parents. They don't know where the parent is. They're just distraught. Their urgent need is just trying to figure out, 'Where is my parent?'"</p>

<p>The decision comes as 17 states, including New York and California, sued the Trump administration Tuesday to force it to reunite children and parents. The states, all led by Democratic attorneys general, joined Washington, D.C., in filing the lawsuit in federal court in Seattle, arguing that they are being forced to shoulder increased child welfare, education and social services costs. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the multistate lawsuit.</p>

<p>"The administration's practice of separating families is cruel, plain and simple," New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. "Every day, it seems like the administration is issuing new, contradictory policies and relying on new, contradictory justifications. But we can't forget: The lives of real people hang in the balance."</p>

<p>In a speech before the conservative Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in Los Angeles, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the administration for taking a hardline stand on illegal immigration and said the voters elected President Donald Trump to do just that.</p>

<p>"This is the Trump era," he said. "We are enforcing our laws again. We know whose side we are on — so does this group — and we're on the side of police, and we're on the side of the public safety of the American people."</p>

<p>After expressing reluctance in May to get too deeply involved in immigration enforcement decisions, the judge who issued Tuesday's ruling was clearly influenced by Trump's reversal last week and the Homeland Security Department's statement on its family reunification plan Saturday night, which, he said, left many questions unanswered.</p>

<p>"This situation has reached a crisis level. The news media is saturated with stories of immigrant families being separated at the border. People are protesting. Elected officials are weighing in. Congress is threatening action," he wrote.</p>

<p>Outraged by the family separations, immigrant supporters have led protests in recent days in states such as Florida and Texas. In Los Angeles, police arrested 25 demonstrators at rally Tuesday ahead of Sessions' address.</p>

<p>Outside the U.S. attorney's office, protesters carried signs reading, "Free the children!" and "Stop caging families." Clergy members blocked the street by forming a human chain. Police handcuffed them and led them away.</p>

<p>Later, protesters gathered outside the hotel where Sessions gave his speech. As the attorney general's motorcade arrived, the crowd chanted, "Nazi, go home."</p>

<h2 id="dasmithonpoliceshootingsbeingavictim">DA Smith on Police Shootings, Being a Victim</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/27/da-smith-police-shootings-being-victim/ </p>

<p>On June 18, 2018, Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith spoke to Jackson’s officer-ID task force about how officer-involved shooting cases go through the system. He is pictured here during one of his trials. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — For the better part of last week's officer-identification task-force meeting at the Jackson Municipal Art Gallery, some of the members didn't know they had a prominent guest.</p>

<p>In its sixth meeting since April without any recommendation, the group carried on its usual banter and monologues about policing, which some members would agree are getting a bit repetitive. It wasn't until the task force's co-chair, attorney CJ Lawrence, mentioned that he wanted to ask the district attorney how many officers his office has indicted that everyone realized that Robert Shuler Smith was in the room.</p>

<p>"Is he here?" Paul Hobson, a Jackson Police Department detective, asked as he looked around the room.</p>

<p>The Hinds County district attorney sat quietly at the end of an L-shaped meeting table inside the City's art gallery—a former stately home tucked behind tall trees and flora that line the garden entryway. Smith sipped from a 20-ounce plastic bottle of Coca-Cola and plucked potato chips carefully without rustling the bag.</p>

<p>After his snack, he scribbled notes randomly with a No. 2 yellow pencil.</p>

<p>Jackson's officer-ID task force invited the district attorney of Mississippi's largest county to speak to them about how officer-involved shootings go through the local criminal-justice system.</p>

<p>Smith's public appearances in the last two years have mainly been in circuit courts as he battled charges that range from hindering prosecution to domestic violence. His Rankin County domestic-violence trial will resume in the fall, after nearly a year of court-ordered delay.</p>

<p>Hinds County DA Robert Shuler Smith's domestic violence trial, which was scheduled for this Monday, has been continued by order of the Court until September 10, 2018. </p>

<p>Translation: you have plenty of time to read up on past @JxnFreePress coverage of him: https://t.co/4mJXVqry78 pic.twitter.com/e5zFdYzDne</p>

<p>— ko “that’s it” bragg. (@keaux_) March 16, 2018</p>

<p>At the June 18 meeting, however, Smith spoke about laws he enforces instead of laws he had been accused of violating. The DA demonstrated that he, in theory, supports progressive measures and national trends on transparency around officer-involved shootings, but, to date, he has not wielded his power as district attorney to make them a reality in Hinds County.</p>

<p>'The Families Deserve Answers'</p>

<p>DA Smith spoke in a cool and collected manner as he divulged as much information as he could about the grand-jury system and even spoke vaguely about cases currently under investigation in his office.</p>

<p>Smith said he did not recall an officer in Hinds County ever being indicted for an officer-involved shooting in his ten-year tenure as district attorney. In April, at least four JPD officers were "no-billed" in three deadly officer-involved shootings spanning from November to February, meaning that those cases will not go to trial unless the district attorney's office decides to investigate further.</p>

<p>Before a grand jury convenes, the district attorney's office receives a case file. Smith said the first thing he and his attorneys do is look at the investigating agency and determine whether or not there has been a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>"We prefer for an outside agency besides JPD to investigate these cases," the district attorney said. "We have a few cases that we're reviewing at this time because the families deserve answers."</p>

<p>Smith spoke of one current case in which his office realized that no one had interviewed a number of witnesses to an officer-involved shooting. He said that case would have to go back to the grand jury because families often hire private attorneys who can gather evidence before the district attorney's office gets to it, posing a problem if they do not cover all the bases in the investigative process.</p>

<p>"But (the investigation) certainly has to be very thorough because, again, we've seen some surprise press conferences where the families are standing outside and complaining, and that's something that we need to address before it continues," Smith said.</p>

<p>Notably, Baltimore-based attorney Jason Downs and the family of 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes held an impromptu press conference on the lawn outside Jackson City Hall in May to reveal that Downs' investigation had found details inconsistent with JPD's internal investigation into the traffic stop that resulted in two officers fatally shooting Barnes.</p>

<p>Downs also released the names of JPD Officers Rakasha Adams and Albert Taylor, believed to have killed Barnes. Their names are on the April no-bill list, with Adams appearing a second time for a separate deadly on-the-job-shooting in November 2017.</p>

<p>A DA's Immense Powers</p>

<p>Downs ultimately filed a petition against the City of Jackson to divulge information in Barnes', case, putting the onus on city officials and police chiefs to be transparent, as is the national trend.</p>

<p>District attorneys have immense powers to change and reform the criminal-justice system. At the meeting, Smith was under the impression that the purpose of the task force was to decide policy that would make everyone at the table, including him, comfortable, and he seemed willing to go along with whatever the end recommendations shall be.</p>

<p>"If there's going to be a policy, then there's going to be a policy. If you all agree that it's going to be 72 hours, then it's 72 hours," Smith said, noncommittally.</p>

<p>To have Smith's support in releasing names should Jackson follow the lead of many other U.S. cities would be the Crisco that eased the system along. But, he has the legal power to do much more than that, like progressive district attorneys nationwide.</p>

<p>Larry Krasner, the district attorney in Philadelphia, Pa., since November 2017, spent three decades suing police for civil-rights violations more than 75 times before be became the district attorney. He wanted to fix the system from the outside.</p>

<p>"I have—like a lot of civil-rights lawyers, like a lot of activists—been beating my head against the wall of the DA's office and the (Philadelphia) police department for a long time because the DA's office in Philly was not enforcing the law against police. Somebody had to do it," he told Business Insider.</p>

<p>Philadelphia is a distinctive place for a progressive district attorney, because he has the power to make a huge difference in a city with a staggering incarceration rate and the highest poverty rate for a big city in the U.S.</p>

<p>The DOJ's assessment of deadly force in the Philadelphia Police Department led to the best-practices recommendation to release names in 72 hours following an officer-involved shooting.</p>

<p>Krasner didn't just run on rhetoric, either. Earlier this month, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Krasner's office "asked the city's Police Department for nearly a decade's accounting of serious violations by its officers so it can compile a comprehensive roster of those who have lied while on duty, used excessive force, racially profiled, or violated civil rights."</p>

<p>The goal is to have more transparency around officers who appear as witnesses, although Krasner has not yet decided if the list would become public.</p>

<p>Transformation is happening in the South too. Kim Ogg, the district attorney of Harris County, Texas—which includes Houston—decriminalized small possessions of marijuana, which diverted 576 people from jail in the first six weeks following her decision and saved the county more than $1.5 million, she told the Texas Observer. She diverts them to drug-education programs instead.</p>

<p>Aramis Ayala, the state's attorney in a district near Orlando, Fla., and the first black state attorney in Florida history, decided not to use the death penalty in her district, despite pressure to implement it in high-profile cases or police killings.</p>

<p>These district and state's attorneys are among a growing class of reformers using their power as the highest prosecutors in their respective areas to enact change.</p>

<p>Many of them unseated longstanding conservative attorneys, including one in the state of Mississippi. Scott Colom, the district attorney in the 16th district that includes Noxubee, Clay, Oktibbeha and Lowndes Counties, defeated Forrest Allgood who had held the position since 1989. The Washington Post coined Allgood as "one of America's worst prosecutors."</p>

<p>Colom ran on the platform that tough-on-crime policies, such as Allgood's, don't work. In 2015 he told Slate that district attorneys should exercise more discretion when it comes to non-violent drug offenders and young people in the system.</p>

<p>During Colom's campaign for district attorney, he tried to inform people of the role's powers, and was "shocked" to find how few people know what DAs actually do. He sought messaging that would stick.</p>

<p>"What really, really resonates with people is when you say, 'We're sending too many young people to jail.' A lot of people agree with that statement. They don't have to understand what the district attorney does," Colom said.</p>

<p>Smith the 'Victim'</p>

<p>DA Smith left the task-force meeting to take a call after his cell phone chimed to the Firefly ringtone on AT&amp;T phones—watch any of the company's commercials, and you'd be familiar with the sound.</p>

<p>An hour into questions from journalists and task-force members, Smith posed a question himself—he wanted to know what Adofo Minka, a criminal-defense attorney who often attends the meetings and writes occasional opinion columns for the Jackson Free Press, thought about the policy of releasing names within 72 hours.</p>

<p>Minka believes the names should be released immediately and that police officers should get the same treatment as any other citizen who discharges a weapon.</p>

<p>"What's good for the goose is good for the gander is my position," Minka said.</p>

<p>While Smith has not proved to be a progressive leader in his role as district attorney, he knows what it is like to be on the other side of a grand jury indictment and to have a mugshot publicly circulated like many arrestees in the Jackson metro area.</p>

<p>Ironically, however, Smith's defense in cases where the State of Mississippi accused him of tampering with prosecutions was that he was trying to protect an innocent man. But Smith did not go through an obviously legal procedure to help Christopher Butler, later convicted of wire fraud and drug trafficking in separate cases.</p>

<p>Instead, Smith shouted at judges and claimed the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics tampered with video surveillance that his office never fully reviewed. A second jury believed Smith, after his first trial ended with a hung jury, and ultimately, a mistrial.</p>

<p>Smith continued to listen as Minka detailed his issues with grand juries.</p>

<p>"These are institutions of secrecy and deception sometimes, so we hold these institutions up like they're some kind of holy grail, but if we look at them from a historical standpoint, they have degraded people...," Minka said.</p>

<p>"I've been a victim of that," the Hinds County district attorney replied.</p>

<h2 id="publishersnotetimestheyareachanginatthejfp">PUBLISHER'S NOTE: Times They Are a Changin’ at the JFP</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Todd Stauffer</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/27/publishers-note-times-they-are-changin-jfp/ </p>

<p>JFP Magazine will focus on great storytelling, such as Donna Ladd’s long-form story this issue about former gangster Benny Ivey, who toured her through South Jackson and Rankin County to explain his history of house burglaries, addiction, dealing meth and leading a white gang. Photo by</p>

<p>Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Todd Stauffer</p>

<p>Let's jump right to it—we're announcing exciting changes with this issue. We've been planning for months how we will best serve the reader, how we serve local businesses and help make Jackson the best place we can moving forward.</p>

<p>In print, we are now Jackson Free Press Magazine. Our team has re-imagined and redesigned the publication to be more pleasing to the eye, and to present tons of interesting tidbits of information, longer story-telling features and in-depth listings.</p>

<p>In fact, "feature" is the critical word. We've heard frequently from readers that your favorite JFP articles go in-depth and tell engaging stories, such as Editor-in-Chief Donna Ladd's cover story on Benny Ivey and other men working to overcome crime and addiction. For news-focused articles, that means looking for both the causes and solutions for problems facing the city and state. For arts and culture, that means focusing more on the people behind those stories, including "why" and "how."</p>

<p>We've also heard it can be tough to get through an issue of the JFP in one week, especially those dense with rich content. We've been thinking for a while about how best to position the print publication and website to serve our readers and advertisers.</p>

<p>Step one: This magazine will be published every two weeks, not weekly. Our focus in print will be narrative feature pieces—built around stories about real people—on both news-related and cultural topics. Breaking news and most opinion will move exclusively to the online Jackson Free Press, where real-time content and commentary are best consumed and discussed. Ultimately, our goal is to put out a publication that makes you want to turn your phone over, lean back in a good chair, and read a story you can't put down.</p>

<p>Step two: We're redesigning Jackson Free Press online. The new design will be mobile-first, and will give us an opportunity to present very appealing layouts and photography in story packages. We're moving our entire 15+ year archive of stories (not a simple task) while taking advantage of the new system to present stories in different, exciting ways. We hope to launch that new site in July, at which point we hope you'll bookmark it, and return over and over again! (Oh, and, yes, our team is using words "podcast" and "more video" frequently as well, so keep an eye out.)</p>

<p>I won't pretend market forces don't influence these changes—paper prices have risen dramatically this year (I'll leave the "tariff talk" for online) while, at the same time, digital advertising options have exploded. By making this move now, we feel we can offer extraordinary benefit to our readers and the advertisers who want to reach our engaged readers through a mix of print and online marketing opportunities.</p>

<p>Nielsen Scarborough reports that the Jackson Free Press has more than 97,000 cumulative ("unique") readers of our print product; in May 2018, we had more than 105,000 unique visitors to our website. So, finding ways for advertisers to reach our audience in both mediums—affordably and targeted—is helping shape our strategy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, JFP Digital Services (jfpdigitalservices.com) has grown by more than 300 percent in the past 18 months. It offers web design, content, social-media and e-mail marketing, logo design, print collateral and more for local businesses and organizations. We're particularly good at working with local service firms who need to convert web visitors into paying clients. If you want your website to generate leads and appointments for you, give us a call. (Or if you need to be a better "publisher" on the web and in social channels, that's our bread and butter. Reach me at 601-362-6121 ext. 17 or todd@jacksonfreepress.com.)</p>

<p>JFP Digital has now added programmatic and retargeting advertising services, along with search-engine marketing. If you'd like a local resource for digital advertising advice—someone knowledgeable to meet with you regularly and work with you to meet your goals—call or write!</p>

<p>Now, let me talk about who has led these changes. We recently said goodbye to Arielle Dreher, with us for three years as our state reporter. Arielle did a fantastic job with award-winning reporting and dogged, shoe-leather, document-scouring investigations. She brought a fantastic attitude to the office every day and was a delight and inspiration for her co-workers and managers. And she helped envision these new products. Watch for an exciting new state reporter to arrive in August to pick up where she left off.</p>

<p>Ko Bragg, our city reporter since just last fall, first received a Bringing Home the World fellowship from the International Center for Journalists, which is sending her to Liberia for two weeks in July to report for the JFP. She then learned that she is a Reveal investigative fellow, with a hefty stipend to do in-depth reporting for us on juveniles tried as adults. And no city coverage we've done or seen rivals her work to date.</p>

<p>The news team—Arielle, Ko and Donna—won multiple awards this spring including Best in Division (and the most in the state) from the southeastern Society of Professional Journalists.</p>

<p>Kristin Brenemen, Zilpha Young, Amber Helsel, Micah Smith and Dustin Cardon played huge roles in the print and website redesigns; Meghan Garner is juggling digital services and sales tasks, and new client website design and launches.</p>

<p>We have three amazing in-house interns this summer: Marie Weidmayer (news), Kristina Domitrovich (editing) and Z'eani Furge (video) for online and print.</p>

<p>Kimberly Griffin, associate publisher, has collaborated with advertisers about the changes. And Cassandra Acker supports the team through office management, sales assistance, and our distribution team rocks.</p>

<p>We're excited to roll into the second half of 2018 with this new look, new focus and a determination to continue producing fantastic solutions journalism and culture coverage with the goal of improving the lives of Jackson-area residents. Thanks for being such a critical part of it!</p>

<p>GULFPORT, Miss. — With his family by his side, Rep. David Baria, leader of the Mississippi House Democratic Caucus, declared victory in his bid for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate Tuesday night.</p>

<p>“We were outspent by our opponents something like four-to-one,” Baria told a crowd of around sixty supporters gathered at Murky Waters BBQ in Gulfport. “But money does not buy Mississippi, folks.”</p>

<p>Baria defeated Democratic opponent Howard Sherman by double digits in Tuesday’s runoff election, after placing a close second to Sherman in the June 11 primary. He will now face incumbent Republican Sen. Roger Wicker in the November general election.</p>

<p>Throughout his primary campaign, Baria emphasized his support for criminal-justice reform, the protections of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion, and equal pay for women.</p>

<p>Baria said he made the decision early on to run an authentic campaign as an unapologetic Democrat, not as “Republican-lite.”</p>

<p>“We decided at the beginning to run the campaign we wanted to run,” Baria said. “We didn’t want to be middle-of-the-road, trying to run away from who we are and what we stand for, so we decided to do this the way we wanted to do it.”</p>

<p>Wicker, Baria said, has been in Washington for 24 years and has millions in campaign cash at his disposal. “But I ain’t scared,” Baria said. “Because every time I’ve been involved in a campaign, I’ve been the underdog. I’ve been outspent two or three to one, and we’ve come out on top every time.”</p>

<p>While admitting that this is his first statewide race, Baria said he feels “confident” going into November. “I’m ready for this fight. I’m eager for this fight. And with you folks on my side, we’re going to win this fight in November.”</p>

<p>Not long after Baria’s win was announced, Wicker’s office released a statement congratulating Baria and adding that he “looks forward to seeing him on the campaign trail.”</p>

<p>Baria will face Wicker in the general election on Nov. 6, 2018.</p>

<p>JACKSON — With his family by his side, Rep. David Baria, leader of the Mississippi House Democratic Caucus, declared victory in his bid for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, at Murky Waters in Gulfport, on Tuesday night after the announcement of the results of the primary run-off.</p>

<p>"We were outspent by our opponents something like four-to-one," Baria told a crowd of around 60 supporters gathered at Murky Waters BBQ in Gulfport. "But money does not buy Mississippi, folks."</p>

<p>Baria defeated Democratic opponent Howard Sherman with 58.5 percent of the votes in Tuesday's runoff election, after placing a close second to Sherman in the June 11 primary.</p>

<p>In Meridian, a smattering of Sherman supporters waited at Weidmann's Restaurant downtown as election returns ended the venture capitalist and businessman's first effort to win political office.</p>

<p>Howard Sherman (right) and his wife, acclaimed actress and Meridian native Sela Ward (left), arrived at the restaurant to accept the runoff defeat after the Associated Press called the election. The couple acknowledged sting from what they described as dirty politics.</p>

<p>Sherman and his wife, acclaimed actress and Meridian native Sela Ward, arrived at the restaurant to accept the runoff defeat after the Associated Press called the election. The couple acknowledged sting from what they described as dirty politics.</p>

<p>"It was a tough race," Sherman said. "Facts about my past were mischaracterized."</p>

<p>After defeating Sherman, Baria will face incumbent Republican Sen. Roger Wicker in the November general election. Throughout his primary campaign, Baria emphasized his support for criminal justice reform, the protections of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion and equal pay for women.</p>

<p>Baria said he made the decision early on to run an authentic campaign as an unapologetic Democrat, not as "Republican-lite."</p>

<p>"We decided at the beginning to run the campaign we wanted to run," Baria said. "We didn't want to be middle-of-the-road, trying to run away from who we are and what we stand for, so we decided to do this the way we wanted to do it."</p>

<p>Throughout Sherman's campaign, questions persisted about his commitment to the Democratic Party. Sherman, a California native, donated cash to Republicans, including Wicker. Sherman said he supported Wicker when the Tea Party Republican Chris McDaniel planned to challenge the senator.</p>

<p>Although Sherman said he has no plans to support Wicker in the general election, the Democrat said he's not ready to make an endorsement for Baria.</p>

<p>"We're not going anywhere," he said. "This where we live; this is where we love."</p>

<p>David Baria hugs his daughter, Merritt Baria, after learning he won the run-off.</p>

<p>Looking toward November, Baria said Wicker's millions of campaign dollars and the 24 years he has spent in Washington, D.C., doesn't faze him. "But I ain't scared," Baria said. "Because every time I've been involved in a campaign, I've been the underdog. I've been outspent two or three to one, and we've come out on top every time."</p>

<p>While admitting that this is his first statewide race, Baria said he feels "confident" going into November. "I'm ready for this fight. I'm eager for this fight. And with you folks on my side, we're going to win this fight in November."</p>

<p>Not long after Baria's win was announced, Wicker's office released a statement congratulating Baria and adding that he "looks forward to seeing him on the campaign trail." Baria will face Wicker in the general election on Nov. 6, 2018.</p>

<p>In the other primary run-off, Rankin and Madison counties District Attorney Michael Guest earned the Republican nomination for the Third U.S. Congressional District. He will face Democratic nominee Michael "Ted" Evans in November. Read the article about the race here.</p>

<h2 id="federalhatecrimechargesfiledinvirginiarallydeath">Federal Hate Crime Charges Filed in Virginia Rally Death</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/27/federal-hate-crime-charges-filed-virginia-rally-de/ </p>

<p>Authorities have said Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the "Unite the Right" rally Aug. 12 that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument. Photo by Flickr/Anthony Crider</p>

<p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring dozens more, now faces federal hate crime charges.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill dozens of other people who were injured. Another charge accuses him of "racially motivated violent interference" with a federally protected activity.</p>

<p>"Last summer's violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation," U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. "Today's indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation."</p>

<p>Authorities have said Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the "Unite the Right" rally Aug. 12 that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument.</p>

<p>Fields already faces state charges including first-degree murder and is set to face a jury trial later this year. He has been in custody since the rally. The attorney representing Fields on those counts declined comment Wednesday.</p>

<p>The car attack came after the rally had descended into chaos — with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators — and authorities had forced the crowd to disband.</p>

<p>The eight-page indictment alleges Fields decided to attend the rally on or before Aug. 8. As he prepared to leave to travel to Charlottesville, a family member sent him a text message urging him to be careful, the indictment said.</p>

<p>Fields replied, "We're not the ones who need to be careful," and attached an image of Hitler, according to the indictment, which also says Fields used social media to promote racist views.</p>

<p>Fields then attended the rally Aug. 12, engaging in chants promoting white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views, the indictment said.</p>

<p>After authorities forced the crowd to disband, Fields drove his car toward the area where a "racially and ethnically diverse crowd" had gathered to protest, the indictment said.</p>

<p>"Fields rapidly accelerated, through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd," it said.</p>

<p>In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge Adam S. Lee of the Richmond Division thanked the business owners and Charlottesville residents who he said "worked with us and provided a massive volume of evidence in this case."</p>

<p>The federal civil rights case is not the first under Sessions' Justice Department, but it is certainly the most high-profile one. Critics of Sessions for the last year have been concerned about what they see as less aggressive enforcement of federal civil rights laws, and especially the Justice Department's lack of intervention against local police agencies with troubled relationships with minorities.</p>

<p>But in bringing the prosecution, Sessions appeared to assert himself as independent from President Donald Trump — who blamed the violence on both sides and was accused of emboldening racists — and suggested that the Justice Department would continue to treat racially motivated acts of violence as hate crimes.</p>

<h2 id="projectejectpreventionpiecebeginsatlocalboysandgirlsclubs">Project EJECT 'Prevention Piece' Begins at Local Boys and Girls Clubs</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-07-02</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jul/02/project-eject-prevention-piece-begins-local-boys-a/ </p>

<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Candace Mayberry delivered a presentation to middle and high schoolers at the Boys and Girls Club on Raymond Road on June 27 and had them take a pledge against gun violence. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — Fifteen minutes before the U.S. Attorney's Office's presentation on June 27 to a room of seventh through twelfth graders at the Boys and Girls Club near Forest Hill High School, kids of all ages swept the floor of the gymnasium with industrial-sized and household brooms, amassing wrappers, dust and bags of chips into a pile by the garbage can. It took an adult to actually get everything into a dustpan and ultimately the trash.</p>

<p>As the particles from the vigorous sweeping job swirled in the air, Assistant U.S. Attorney Candace Mayberry plugged in a laptop and got some kids to use blue masking tape to hang up a pledge against gun violence printed on a white banner that included the Boys and Girls Club logo. Others pulled two sets of bleachers from the wall and moved them to the middle of the room, where the teens would sit for Mayberry's presentation.</p>

<p>Mayberry is from Jackson, so she was able to color her presentation with personal and relatable anecdotes.</p>

<p>"I also used to be a defense attorney, and I represented kids that were 13, 15, 16, 19, and it's not abnormal to see that," she said. "It hurts to see someone close to my daughter's age and someone who is what I consider still a child in handcuffs, but that's our reality."</p>

<p>Mayberry leads the "prevention piece" of Project EJECT, as it is labeled in a press release. It includes various speaking engagements with young people. This is a part of the U.S. Attorney's Office's L.E.A.D. Program: Legal Enrichment and Decision Making. U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst's predecessor, Greg Davis, began the program through which he spoke to students across the state.</p>

<p>Davis and Hurst differ, however, on their approaches to violent-crime in Jackson. Davis' Jackson Violent Crime Initiative aimed to remove violent offenders from the streets and also worked in conjunction with federal partners. But Davis did not include the caveat that such people would be thrown out of their communities, as is the fundamental promise in Hurst's Project EJECT: Empowering Jackson Expelling Crime Together.</p>

<p>In a March interview, Davis told the Jackson Free Press that by the nature of the federal system, people are "more than likely" sent out of the area.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>'That's Not Fair to You'</p>

<p>Project EJECT did not come up on June 27, but the program did focus on guns. Gun crimes are a fundamental element of Project EJECT, from being a felon in possession of an armed weapon to armed robbery of businesses that do interstate commerce, such as Family Dollar.</p>

<p>Jeffery Artis of the Jackson Federal Bureau of Investigations, also a Project EJECT partnering entity, led a hand-raising activity.</p>

<p>About two-thirds of the teens raised their hand to say they knew someone who had been shot. Fewer raised their hands to indicate that they knew someone who had shot someone. Five kids put their hands straight up to say they felt they needed a gun, with some hands hovering shoulder height. About the same number raised their hands to say they felt they one day might be shot.</p>

<p>"That's sad. That should not be. You should not know someone that's been shot or that has shot someone. ...That's not fair to you," Artis said.</p>

<p>Artis did not want the youth to accept homicides as normal behavior, and mentioned that some places do not have any homicides at all, but failed to name any major cities with such a statistic. The current homicide count in Jackson hovers at 51 at press time.</p>

<p>Mayberry was vulnerable with the kids and related to the violence in Jackson from personal experience, as younger kids' shrill voices from the connecting room competed with hers in the echoing gym.</p>

<p>"I have classmates ...behind bars, I have classmates who did not make it to 35 (years old)," Mayberry said. She encouraged the kids to think about where they want to see themselves as adults.</p>

<p>"I Will Never Bring a Gun to School' </p>

<p>Toward the end of her presentation, Mayberry rolled local-news footage of juveniles in orange jumpsuits facing adult charges and strolling by cameras for perp walks in the now-outlawed practice in Jackson following a Jackson Free Press analysis of the effects of sensationalizing youth crime.</p>

<p>The program at the Boys and Girls Club put emphasis on making better choices and choosing to stay in school because poor decisions lead to crime, as one PowerPoint slide summated.</p>

<p>"I came to talk to you all today because your decisions matter—your decisions matter to me," Mayberry said in her opening remarks.</p>

<p>The speakers put the onus on kids to make better decisions. However, crime stems from a host of other problems and situations, such as poverty, that do not fall under the purview of adolescent responsibility.</p>

<p>The afternoon closed with the teens and speakers gathering in a circle, holding hands and reciting a pledge against gun violence.</p>

<p>"I will never bring a gun to school. I will never use a gun to settle a personal problem or dispute. I will use my influence with my friends to keep them from using guns to settle disputes," the pledge reads.</p>

<p>The next events will take place on July 23 at the Boys and Girls Club on West Capitol Street and July 26 at the Boys and Girls Club on Sykes Road.</p>

<p>A press release said the U.S. Attorney's Office expects to reach more than 400 students in the metro area this summer, and the L.E.A.D. program will continue into the school year.</p>

<h2 id="abortionrightscouldbelitmustestforhighcourtnominee">Abortion Rights Could be Litmus Test for High Court Nominee</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-07-02</p>

<p>Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a key vote on President Donald Trump's pick for the Supreme Court, said Sunday she would oppose any nominee she believed would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Photo by Flickr/Medill DC</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a key vote on President Donald Trump's pick for the Supreme Court, said Sunday she would oppose any nominee she believed would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.</p>

<p>The White House is focusing on five to seven potential candidates to fill the vacancy of retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote on the court. The Maine senator said she would only back a judge who would show respect for settled law such as the 45-year-old Roe decision, which has long been anathema to conservatives.</p>

<p>"I would not support a nominee who demonstrated hostility to Roe v. Wade because that would mean to me that their judicial philosophy did not include a respect for established decisions, established law," Collins said.</p>

<p>Such a judge, she said, "would not be acceptable to me because that would indicate an activist agenda."</p>

<p>Trump spent the weekend at his New Jersey golf club conferring with his advisers, including White House counsel Don McGahn, as he considers his options to fill the vacancy that might make precedent-shattering court decisions on abortion, health care, gay marriage and other issues.</p>

<p>The president told reporters Friday that he was homing in on up to seven candidates, including two women, and would announce his choice on July 9.</p>

<p>Trump is expected to begin his search in earnest this week at the White House and said the process could include interviews at his golf club before he reaches a final decision following the Fourth of July holiday.</p>

<p>During his 2016 campaign and presidency, Trump embraced anti-abortion groups and vowed to appoint federal judges who will favor efforts to roll back abortion rights. But he told reporters on Friday that he would not question potential high-court nominees about their views on abortion, saying it was "inappropriate to discuss."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973, but anti-abortion advocates hope Roe v. Wade will soon be overruled if Trump gets the chance to appoint a justice who could cast a potentially decisive vote against it.</p>

<p>Without Kennedy, the high court will have four justices picked by Democratic presidents and four picked by Republicans, giving Trump the chance to shift the ideological balance toward conservatives for years to come. Both Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first pick to the high court, have indicated more broadly that they respect legal precedent.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Leonard Leo, an outside adviser to Trump on judicial nominations, said he expected Trump to select a nominee who is mindful of precedent but who is also more "originalist and textualist." That judicial approach typically involves a more literal interpretation of the Constitution, and not reading into the Constitution language that doesn't explicitly appear. Roe, for instance, relied on a right to privacy, which is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.</p>

<p>Possible nominees being eyed include Thomas Hardiman, who serves alongside Trump's sister on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and Raymond Kethledge, a federal appeals court judge who clerked for Kennedy. Also of interest are Amul Thapar, who serves on the federal appeals court in Cincinnati; Brett Kavanaugh, a former clerk for Kennedy who serves on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.; and Amy Coney Barrett, who serves on the federal appeals court in Chicago.</p>

<p>Echoing Leo's view, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Judiciary Committee, said he didn't think Trump would be overly focused on the Roe ruling.</p>

<p>"You don't overturn precedent unless there's a good reason," Graham said. "I would tell my pro-life friends: You can be pro-life and conservative, but you can also believe in 'stare decisis,'" he said, citing the legal term involving legal precedent that means "to stand by things decided."</p>

<p>Republicans hold a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate, and it's even closer because of the absence of ailing Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Even though McConnell changed Senate rules last year to allow confirmation by simple majority, if Democrats hold together, he cannot afford defections. Vice President Mike Pence can be called on to break a tie.</p>

<p>Collins appeared on ABC's "This Week" and CNN's "State of the Union," Leo spoke on "Fox News Sunday" and Graham was on NBC's "Meet the Press."</p>

<h2 id="interimjpdchiefjamesdavisstartsjobpermanentsearchunderway">Interim JPD Chief James Davis Starts Job, Permanent Search Underway</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-29</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/29/interim-jpd-chief-james-davis-starts-job-permanent/ </p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba selected former Assistant Chief James Davis (pictured) to serve as interim chief of police of the Jackson Police Department on June 28, 2018. He is the second interim police chief under Lumumba this year. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — James Davis' first words as Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba's second interim chief of police were "Glory be to God." He uttered them yesterday in Jackson City Hall's ceremonial office, just dozens of feet away from where a dead body had been found hours before.</p>

<p>In response to a call from a concerned citizen, the Jackson Police Department found an unresponsive black man on the sidewalk in front of the Warren Hood building (directly across from City Hall) shortly before 7 a.m. on June 28. JPD believes the man had been assaulted prior to his death. The cause of death is pending results of an autopsy, and the victim's identity has yet to be released.</p>

<p>For a few hours after discovering the body, JPD taped off the streets around City Hall, and city employees who work in the Hood building had to use a rear entrance.</p>

<p>By the time the afternoon press conference rolled around, things seemed normal outside the municipal buildings, and aside from the mayor's brief mention that he could provide very little information about the open investigation, the announcements about the new interim chief went as planned.</p>

<p>In the 25 years Davis has been with JPD, he has moved up the ranks from 10 years as a patrol officer to the first African American range master at the training academy, to sergeant, to lieutenant of the 3rd Precinct, to district commander, to deputy chief, to assistant chief, and now interim chief. Davis also spent 15 years with the S.W.A.T. team, and has been a Jackson resident for 30 years. He hopes to become the mayor's ultimate choice to run the capital city's police force.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would like to be permanent chief," Davis said to reporters.</p>

<p>Mayor Lumumba said he will be "simultaneously commencing a permanent search for police chief" alongside Davis' appointment.</p>

<p>The mayor did not want to suggest that his administration had not yet begun searching for a permanent police chief since Chief Lee Vance stepped down in late December, but rather that he had been considering how things were progressing under the outgoing interim chief. Lumumba stressed that his administration is the first to face the state law that only allows interim employees to serve 180 days. This went into effect in July 2017—the same month of Lumumba's inauguration.</p>

<p>Anthony Moore, the city's first interim chief following Vance's retirement in December 2017, was not at the press conference yesterday. In his absence, Lumumba summarized Moore's six-month tenure, which included starting the officer-ID task force, eliminating the distribution of mugshots following officer-involved shootings and juveniles charged as adults, and bringing in the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations to investigate officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether or not Moore will even remain with JPD following this transition.</p>

<p>"I thought that (Moore) brought necessary leadership for the time that he was there, and we're thankful for his contribution," the mayor said. "He has been requested to continue to serve with the police department, and that is a decision that he is taking the time to deliberate on and see whether he feels that he can be of service. So we're looking forward to his response in that."</p>

<p>Davis will be able to put in his bid to be permanent chief, Lumumba said, and the mayor believes he will be a strong leader.</p>

<p>"We do seek stability, but at the same time our principled purpose is to make sure we make the right decision for the citizens of Jackson," Lumumba said. "I do believe that Chief Davis with his time in the police department will bring great leadership ... and the possibility that he could be the permanent selection."</p>

<p>When Davis stepped to the podium, he talked about implementing community-policing practices by setting an example. He promised that more of his officers, including the handful that stood behind him, would be visible in the communities so they can be proactive about crime.</p>

<p>"My beat officers, instead of driving through the community, I want them to slow down and talk to the kid on the corner—talk to Ms. Johnson on the porch," Davis said. "I do it, and I ask that they do it."</p>

<p>Davis also talked about collaborating with the community to solve crimes and using resources from federal partners. U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst was among the crowd in the ceremonial office.</p>

<p>"I'm just here today to show my support for the Jackson Police Department and let the public know that the U.S. Attorney's Office will continue to do its part in cleaning up the city of Jackson and protecting our citizens from violent crime," he told the Jackson Free Press after the press conference.</p>

<p>Hurst's brainchild to fight crime in Jackson is Project EJECT: Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together. Mayor Lumumba in the past has been hesitant to say that Project EJECT is a City initiative, although it makes use of JPD. But with more and more Project EJECT stings in the capital city in partnership with JPD, the collaborative effort is clear and will likely continue under Davis.</p>

<p>"We're going to reach out for all the resources that we possibly can to address the crime issues in Jackson," Davis said.</p>

<h2 id="ryansetshousevoteongopimmigrationbillforwednesday">Ryan Sets House Vote on GOP Immigration Bill for Wednesday</h2>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-26</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Paul Ryan scheduled a long-awaited showdown vote on a broad Republican immigration bill for Wednesday, but is showing little confidence that the package will survive.</p>

<p>Underscoring the legislation's weak prospects in his GOP-run chamber, Ryan, R-Wis., declined to answer questions Tuesday about a separate, narrow measure Republicans are privately discussing. It would focus on the issue that has grabbed public attention in recent days: the Trump administration's separation of migrant children from their parents when families are caught crossing the border without authorization.</p>

<p>"If that doesn't succeed, then we'll cross that bridge," Ryan told reporters about his preference to focus on trying to pass the broader bill. "But the last thing I want to do is undercut a vote on what is a great consensus bill."</p>

<p>Many conservatives are preparing to vote against the wider ranging bill because it would provide a chance for citizenship for many immigrants who arrived illegally in the U.S. as children. They have blasted that provision as "amnesty," and the emerging, narrower bill would give them a chance to show they are addressing family separation without risking the wrath of hard-right voters.</p>

<p>The broader measure would also stop the Homeland Security Department from separating migrant families and provide $25 billion for President Donald Trump's border wall and other security measures. Democrats are expected to solidly oppose that bill, which is a compromise between GOP moderates and conservatives.</p>

<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., weighed in from across the Capitol, criticizing Trump for lacking a process for bringing families back together. Trump signed an executive order last week reversing his own administration policy of separating families, but many children remain apart from their parents.</p>

<p>"This administration needs to present a plan ASAP of how to unify the kids and how to deal with border. They have no plan," Schumer said.</p>

<p>Ryan praised the compromise GOP bill.</p>

<p>"What we have here is the seeds of consensus," he said. He predicted it would be the basis for legislation that eventually becomes law, "hopefully now but if not, later."</p>

<p>He also accused Democrats of favoring a return to the previous "catch and release" policy under which immigrants being prosecuted were released into the U.S. until their court dates. Under Trump's "zero tolerance" policy, more migrants are being prosecuted and therefore detained.</p>

<p>Ryan said Democrats would in effect "tell the world, 'You can just come to this country, we're not going to have closed borders.'"</p>

<p>Republicans exited a closed-door strategy session in the Capitol basement with little indication that party leaders had finally won enough over to approve the bill.</p>

<p>"You've got to be unified on this and I get the feeling we're not unified," said Rep. Paul Cook, R-Calif., who said he was still deciding what to do.</p>

<p>Looking to garner support, leaders added provisions making it easier for migrant agriculture workers to stay in the U.S. for longer periods, and requiring employers to verify workers' citizenship. But several lawmakers said those provisions hadn't addressed the major reason for GOP disaffection — opposition to helping young immigrants stay in the U.S. legally who broke laws to arrive.</p>

<p>"I don't think it advances the ball, I really don't," said Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Ala.</p>

<p>A Senate Republican family separation bill would also add more immigration judges to reduce the backlog of cases, but Trump has opposed that, saying it would only lead to graft.</p>

<p>Still, many Republicans are eager to address the border crisis and distance themselves from the Trump administration's policy that has resulted in more than 2,300 migrant children being separated from their parents.</p>

<p>Lawmakers heading into midterm elections want to be able to show constituents they voted to end it. Some 500 minors have been reunited so far, officials said.</p>

<p>"I don't know why we wouldn't vote for a bill that keeps families together," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.</p>

<p>Senate Republicans have proposed legislation that would lift rules that prevent children from being held longer than 20 days in custody. It would add 200 immigration judges to more quickly process the claims.</p>

<p>Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has been holding discussions with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to see if they can reach middle ground on what to do about separated families.</p>

<p>With the Senate's narrow 51-seate GOP majority, a compromise with Democrats would likely be needed to reach the 60-vote threshold usually required to advance legislation. But resolution seemed difficult.</p>

<p>Republicans are worried about leaving town for the weeklong July 4 recess without addressing immigration issues, particularly the family separations at the border.</p>

<p>JACKSON — On the evening of March 8, a Flowood Police Department officer unloaded his gun into Von McDavid's car somewhere between four and eight times. McDavid had gone to the exterior walk-up pharmacy at a nearby Kroger shortly before they were closing, and an employee there suspected McDavid of obtaining medication unlawfully, his lawyer, Dow Yoder, said.</p>

<p>An officer met McDavid in the parking lot, and then the story gets murky depending on who is telling it. Flowood Police Chief Richie McCluskey said in a statement released that same night that a preliminary investigation showed the responding officer attempted to arrest McDavid, who got into his vehicle and tried to run over the arresting officer.</p>

<p>"Our officer shot into the car, fearing for his life while attempting to get out of harm's way as the suspect continued through the parking lot and eventually crashed into a ditch near the intersection of Lakeland Drive and Grants Ferry Rd," McCluskey said in the statement.</p>

<p>The attorney representing McDavid, Yoder, contests that his client had committed a misdemeanor or felony crime to warrant arrest in the first place, let alone the use of deadly force. Yoder is a former assistant district attorney for Madison and Rankin counties and a former special assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Yoder told the Jackson Free Press that an officer approached McDavid, yelling and with his hands on a pistol, so McDavid got back in the car. He said the officer was standing about 3 feet from the passenger headlight of the car when McDavid cranked his car up and the officer drew his pistol.</p>

<p>His client was "freaking out," Yoder said, and felt like the officer was looking for an excuse to shoot him because he hadn't done anything wrong, adding when McDavid tried to put his hand on the gear shift, the officer unloaded. Yoder said McDavid turned his car away from the officer and drove off into a nearby ditch because "he figured that was better than being still and letting the officer kill him."</p>

<p>McDavid apparently told Yoder that when some officers came to that ditch, he felt they were "just looking at him hoping he was going to die in the ditch before the ambulance got there," he said in the interview.</p>

<p>McDavid was transported to the University of Mississippi Medical Center intensive care unit that night. Now he is at his mother's house recovering. Yoder said on Thursday he had spoken with McDavid's mother, whom he describes as a "sweet, wonderful Christian lady," and that she said her son's emotional and psychological injuries at this point are just as detrimental to him as the gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>The approach of giving officers wide discretion on whether to fire into a moving vehicle is not considered a national best practice for policing. The Police Executive Research Forum released a report in March 2016, "Guiding Principles on Use of Force," warning about the high dangers of shooting into moving vehicles.</p>

<p>Police officers shooting into moving vehicles has drawn national scrutiny in the United States due to the dangers it poses and not only to the driver. Law-enforcement experts warn that not only the targeted driver be injured or killed, but that an out-of-control vehicle then poses dangers to both the officers as well as bystanders and property. Officers should "move" out of the path of moving vehicles, policing experts advise, if at all possible and then follow specific procedures that should be part of their training.</p>

<p>Whether or not McDavid commited a crime is not clear, especially with the few details the Flowood Police Department has offered to date other than that the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations has stepped in to investigate. Yoder says a Flowood city clerk told him that his client does not face any pending charges so far.</p>

<p>The Flowood Police Department has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Jackson Free Press nor replied to voicemails left on various department's machines. Yoder laments the lack of transparency in this process.</p>

<p>"[I]t is very likely that now the Flowood Police Department is scrambling around trying to come up with evidence to justify what happened that they did not know about, and they did not have at the time (that) they used this unreasonably forceable pursuit and apprehension of apparently just someone they thought was suspicious."</p>

<p>Yoder's best hope is getting his hands on some video from either body cameras and/or Kroger video surveillance because without it, it is McDavid's word against the officer's.</p>

<p>"If there's not any clear video evidence that shows what really happens, guess who that favors? That favors the Flowood Police Department. Why? Because then it makes it a swearing match between one Flowood police officer and a suspect," Yoder told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"Most people are going to believe the police officer," he added. "But when a police officer shoots at a car, nine times and shoots somebody six times (who) was not under arrest at the time of the shooting, and at the time of the shooting there was no probable cause to make an arrest, then obviously that police officer is going to have a motive to justify what we did—and he's going to have an awfully hard time doing it."</p>

<hr />

<p>LB • 3 months ago The JFP has done a great job covering Police involved shootings this year. The volume of police shootings should be cause for concern for all sides of the political spectrum: the Left has good reason to be concerned for the racial disparity of victims of police violence, and the Right has good reason to see police violence as a vast overstep of government authority. It should be a galvanizing issue.</p>

<p>But I think there is much more to this issue. Thus far in 2018 Jackson has had about 20 homicides (depending on how you count police shootings). The homicides overwhelmingly involve handguns. Perhaps we are best served to see the police shootings problem as part of a larger problem with gun violence in and around Jackson. Local officials appear to be silent on the issue. Other than the much-maligned Project EJECT, I am unaware of any steps taken by local officials to curb the problem. And other than the standard article detailing the latest shooting, I don't see local writers/commentators seeing this issue as a bigger problem.</p>

<p>From my vantage point, the work of the JFP was instrumental in getting a policy discussion started on police violence. I hope to see a similar policy discussion started about the larger issue of gun violence in Jackson.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd Moderator LB • 3 months ago Thanks, LB. I appreciate that. As you may know, we've dedicated a lot of time and words to our crime-prevention beat in recent years with much of the work at jfp.ms/preventingviolence. We saw a blip from it with at least one council member (Priester) and several mayoral candidates (Horhn and Lumumba included) widening the conversation about policing and violence prevention here, including with guns. They both were talking in some way about violence interrupters/credible messengers, for instance, which we wrote extensively about as a potential solution (including the biggest one in U.S., cureviolence.org). And Horhn at least talked about the very-good BOTEC reports with causes and potential solutions for Jackson, and that was paid for by the Legislature. However, much of that conversation has died out recently, and we're left with old ideas proven both to have limited effectiveness as well as have potential for great racial disparities such as Project Eject. Fortunately, the push for an expanded gang law died (and it could easily have created more criminal gang members).</p>

<p>So I hope this policy discussion will get going sometime soon. I expected and would like to see Mayor Lumumba lead it, although we haven't heard much of substance from him, yet.</p>

<p>I am heartened that some prison reform/reentry legislation made it through the Legislature this session, pushed largely by conservatives like Rep. Bomgar and my new friend/frenemy (ha) Russ Latino (we may only agree on this!) and his organization). I'm waiting for the Dems to step up and be loud on these issues, including the white ones like AG Hood, who hasn't been great on criminal-justice/reform issues to date.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd Moderator Donna Ladd • 3 months ago Here's BOTEC gang violence assessment on Jackson with some interesting ideas. I'm probably less sold on Operation Ceasefire to date than they are, but if it's done right, it's so much better than what is done now to prevent and decrease gun violence here. I like the Peace Institute stuff a lot, which isn't as granola California as the name might sound!Donna Ladd Moderator LB • 3 months ago And for the record, I see the police shooting as vast overreach by the government as well. These issues really shouldn't be right or left on any of the reasons. We should all care about public safety, racial/other disparities, costs and how suspects are treated (ultimately determining if they will re-offend in many cases). It's not easy to tackle, but a good first step is taking dumb partisan politics out of the equation.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics announced this week that officials will now respond to the scene of every suspected overdose in the state in order to assist coroners and medical examiners in reporting deaths by opioid overdose. File Photo</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — In the wake of a national opioid epidemic, Mississippi is toughening its investigations of drug overdose deaths.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics announced this week that officials will now respond to the scene of every suspected overdose in the state in order to assist coroners and medical examiners in reporting deaths by opioid overdose.</p>

<p>Overdose reporting forms are also now available online as part of the Bureau's effort. Coroners and medical examiners are required by state law to report overdose deaths to the MBN, but they previously reported by fax. With online reporting, MBN hopes to make reporting faster and simpler.</p>

<p>MBN Director John Dowdy said he hopes the more dogged overdose investigations will help the Bureau crack down on deadly drug dealers more quickly.</p>

<p>"It is vitally important to be proactive in identifying the source of illegal narcotics," Dowdy told The Associated Press.</p>

<p>By immediately showing up to the scene of an overdose, Dowdy said MBN officials can launch into an investigation as soon as possible, talking to potential witnesses or recovering cell phone records to find the source of the fatal drug.</p>

<p>More than 50 state coroners and medical examiners comply with state overdose reporting mandates, according to the MBN, although there are 82 Mississippi coroners. Dowdy attributed this discrepancy to some counties not having "any overdoses to report," and noted that the number of reporting coroners has nearly doubled since 2016.</p>

<p>According to the Bureau, 255 Mississippians were reported to have died by drug overdose in 2017.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national public health state of emergency in October. More than 42,000 Americans died by opioid overdose in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- five times more than in 1999.</p>

<h2 id="updatedcitymayidcopswhodischargeweaponswithin72hoursestablishingtaskforce">UPDATED: City May ID Cops Who Discharge Weapons Within 72 Hours, Establishing Task Force</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p>Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore has not released the names of any officers who have shot at civilians since he took the position in January 2018. He is pictured here at a press conference on Feb. 26. 2018. Photo by</p>

<p>Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>A post on the NextDoor neighborhood website today revealed that the City of Jackson may change its policy and require that the Jackson Police Department start releasing names of the officers involved in a shooting within 72 hours, a best-practices period that the Jackson Free Press has supported in recent editorials.</p>

<p>JPD officers have been involved in at least seven shootings since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba took office last July, promising criminal-justice reform. JPD has not released the names of any of those officers who fired on civilians, leading to several deaths, nor detailed the circumstances of those shootings. The department cites the need for officer safety.</p>

<p>In the NextDoor post, a participant related that a JPD commander is asking citizens to push back against revealing the officers' names.</p>

<p>"[P]lease come to the (JPD headquarters downtown) tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. and the City Council Meeting at 6:00 p.m.," the post stated. "The city has proposed releasing the names of all officers involved in a shooting within 72 hours. The police are very against this. They and their families get death threats immediately from family and friends of the person who was shot. This is before the investigation into whether the shooting was justified or not. Frankly, this only enflames already heated emotions and puts our officers and their families at grave risk. If you're concerned for the safety of our officers, please come to the meetings. The Chief will explain their position at 11:00 and hopes we will all go to the Council to express our support for them."</p>

<p>JPD headquarters is at 327 Pascagoula St., near City Hall.</p>

<p>JFP city reporter Ko Bragg has reported that civilians, including family members of people killed by police, are demanding more transparency about the shootings.</p>

<p>In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice advised police departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident. Some cities release them as soon as 48 hours after the shooting. The DOJ report said that departments can take steps to ensure officer safety during those brief delays.</p>

<p>Lumumba recently announced that JPD would no longer release mugshots of people shot by police, after JPD sent out a blurry mugshot of an unarmed woman killed after at least one officer shot into her car and gave other media details of her minor police record. He also said JPD would no longer release mugshots of juveniles in custody, after an investigation by the Jackson Free Press of the practice.</p>

<p>The mayor also told the Jackson Free Press that is against JPD setting up "perp walks" of juveniles so that media can get photographs and footage of the accused children who are already in custody and are often later moved back to the juvenile-detention center where they are not available to the media. The Jackson Free Press also learned that juveniles charged as adults are often sitting in the detention center for 180 days without being indicted.</p>

<p>After this article appeared March 26, the mayor's office sent out the following statement early the next morning, announcing the task force. The full statement follows:</p>

<p>"The Jackson Police Department is committed to serving and protecting all Jackson residents and holds its officers to the highest standards of conduct. When officer-involved shootings do occur, accountability to the public and for the safety of officers is a primary concern. JPD has a long-standing practice of not releasing the names of officers involved in shootings during the performance of their duties. This practice was designed to ensure the safety of officers and their families and to enable the department to more efficiently conduct its investigation of the incident.</p>

<p>"We recognize that this practice can be difficult for victims and their loved ones involved in these incidents. Due to recent concerns raised about the lack of transparency inherent to this practice, Mayor Lumumba is establishing a task force to address the formation of JPD policy that will govern the release of names, and the timeframe during which this should take place. Specifically, the Task Force will be made up of citizens, officers and members of his administration who are charged with establishing policy that keeps in mind both sensitivity to community concerns as well as an understanding of the unique responsibilities and safety of law enforcement. We expect that this process will yield a policy that works for all stakeholders.</p>

<p>"We have confidence and trust in JPD—and we are indeed concerned with the frequency of officer- involved shootings. The loss of life is always tragic, and it is imperative that our policy reflect our genuine concern for the safety of everyone. We truly believe that through the work and deliberation of this task force, we will be able to strengthen the bonds between our officers and the communities they serve, while simultaneously building the transparency and trust necessary to move our great City forward."</p>

<p>NOTE: The NextDoor commenter later changed the location of the 11 a.m. Tuesday meeting with police about the new identification policy from the Fondren precinct to JPD headquarters downtown at 327 Pascagoula St. The change is reflected above.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Wayne Kuhn completed his sentence for a grand larceny charge in the 1980s more than 25 years ago. He even got his record expunged—and yet he still cannot vote in Mississippi.</p>

<p>"God forgives us, but Mississippi doesn't," he said this morning outside the secretary of state's office, across from the state capitol.</p>

<p>Kuhn is one of five named plaintiffs suing Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann in his official capacity over the state constitution, which bars certain Mississippians from voting ever again if they have been convicted of one of the list of 22 disenfranchising crimes.</p>

<p>A recent study from the Sentencing Project, One Voice and the NAACP shows that the list affects an estimated 218,181 Mississippians. In an analysis of 2016 data, researchers found that 93 percent of those disenfranchised on Mississippi's list live in the community—not behind bars.</p>

<p>Kuhn and four other men named in the complaint, brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett law firm, seek to have their voting rights restored, but the complaint also challenges the process for suffrage restoration in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Jonathan Youngwood, one of the attorneys representing the class, noted that while state law says a person must get a suffrage bill to pass through the Legislature by a two-thirds vote of the House and the Senate, other guidelines make the process arbitrary.</p>

<p>"Once you've served your time, you need to get your right to vote restored," Youngwood said.</p>

<p>He said that states could bar voting for a time period, but barring some Mississippians from voting permanently is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The list of 22 disenfranchising crimes includes a broad range of felonies from receiving stolen goods to murder. The list dates back to a time in Mississippi history when white lawmakers targeted black men for certain crimes, in an effort to limit their right to vote.</p>

<p>Byron Coleman, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said he was convicted of receiving stolen goods several years ago. That felony is disenfranchising in the state of Mississippi. Coleman said he had paid his debt to society.</p>

<p>"Before I leave this world, I would like my record to be clear," he said this morning.</p>

<p>A measure that would have directed lawmakers and state leaders to study disenfranchisement died this year in the Legislature. The SPLC lawsuit is a federal class-action case, which challenges the constitutionality of Mississippi's disenfranchising crimes list as well as its suffrage process.</p>

<h2 id="celebratingthelifeofmankilledbyjpd">Celebrating the Life of Man Killed by JPD</h2>

<p>The family and friends of Lee Edward Bonner who died after JPD officers shot him on Feb. 21 gathered at the home where it took place to do a neighborhood cleanup on March 24, 2018, much like the ones Bonner organized when he was alive. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — Sylvester Richard, 34, pulled up to Deer Park Street on Saturday, March 24, in a burgundy Chevy Tahoe sitting on 30-inch rims. He was at least an hour late, but seemingly not in a rush. He stopped to fist bump folks sitting outside of what looked like an abandoned building, but actually served as a makeshift pool hall. People danced on the corner outside of it and sipped from malt beers in 40-ounce bottles partially masked with paper bags.</p>

<p>"Here he comes, he's waving to his constituents," Richard's cousin Tetrina Blalock said as he got closer to her and the rest of their family and friends.</p>

<p>As Richard walked toward a blue tent set up in a dusty empty lot in the middle of the block where his family had gathered, everyone applauded as Blalock had encouraged everyone to do, as she made fun of him for rolling up like a celebrity.</p>

<p>The family had come together to do a neighborhood clean-up throughout the streets near the 1300 block of Deer Park Street, where Jackson police shot Richard's brother, Lee Edward Bonner, perhaps a dozen times about a month ago. Bonner was known for doing neighborhood cleanups and encouraging people around him to care about where they lived.</p>

<p>On Feb. 21, two plain-clothes detectives pursued Bonner and another man, whom JPD did not capture, in what police called a narcotics investigation. After a foot chase that led to an abandoned house on Deer Park Street with an overgrown yard, police say Bonner pulled put a gun and fired at the officers at least once, so they returned fire. Bonner died days later from injuries sustained during that shooting.</p>

<p>The family does not necessarily contest Bonner may have pulled a gun out, but they do see his death as "overkill." Richard told the Jackson Free Press his brother's left eye was gone when he made it to the hospital and that Bonner had been shot twice in the head, twice in the back, once in the left arm bursting the main artery there, twice in both sides, two times in the pelvis and twice more in the leg.</p>

<p>"It didn't take that many shots—he wasn't nothing but 130 pounds," Richard told the Jackson Free Press. "Nobody deserves that, they could have shot him in the leg, arm or anything. ... It's like they came with the intention to do that."</p>

<p>Richard's words are almost identical to what the grandmother of Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old black man Sacramento, Calif., police shot 20 times in her backyard on March 18 because they thought he had a gun, although it turned out to be a cell phone.</p>

<p>"They didn't have to kill him like that, they didn't have to shoot him so many times," Sequita Thompson said Monday about Clark at a press conference in Sacramento. She also believes they could have aimed for an arm or a leg, or used a Taser for instance.</p>

<p>In Clark's case, his community has been protesting on his behalf, even shutting down an interstate.</p>

<p>But, in Jackson, no one has taken to the streets for any of the last seven officer-involved shootings since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba took office in July 2017 with none of the officers involved identified to date. Bonner's brother wants police reform, but also for the community to come together and demand change—and more answers from JPD.</p>

<p>'I Know My Brother'</p>

<p>Richard looked out over Deer Park Street, which serves as a border of the west Jackson community he grew up in, just a stone's throw away from Jackson State University. He pointed out empty lots where more homes used to stand, and he reminisced about the corner store that now has wooden planks across the windows.</p>

<p>Richard sipped a grape Faygo that he was careful to throw into the trash when he finished, instead of casting it among the overwhelming litter that peppered the neighborhood. Richard reflected about the police harassing him and his brothers even when they were young—decades before Richard, Bonner and the brother in between them spent any time in jail.</p>

<p>Bonner had been out of jail for at least 10 months without violating his parole and it seemed that Bonner had been determined to stay out for good this time, Richard said.</p>

<p>"I know my brother—he tried," Richard said. "The way (the police) came at him...it was something very personal."</p>

<p>Blalock has also told the Jackson Free Press that she believes her cousin's shooting was personal. Richard and Blalock have both also said that Bonner had previously filed complaints against the officers who shot him, but a JFP records request to the JPD turned up no such documents. Still, Richard contends that the detectives were in Deer Park on Feb. 21 to be bothersome, not for a narcotics investigation.</p>

<p>"They ain't find no drugs on him, at all period," Richard said.</p>

<p>Richard also takes issue with the way JPD was quick to release that his brother was a convicted felon. Having a criminal record himself, Richard does not see being a good person and a convicted felon as mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>"You look at a (whole) person, you just don't view them from their background," Richard said. "You don't know what a person does for the community."</p>

<p>Stepping Up</p>

<p>Less than 200 feet from the place where Bonner had been shot, a blue T-shirt was cloaked around the sign as if it moonlighted as a mannequin. On the shirt, screen-printed white doves flittered above Bonner in a blue fitted cap with the brim to the rear. Above the image on the shirt reads "Justice for Lee Bonner."</p>

<p>Family and friends gathered in that yard to pray before the cleanup, and many had on various T-shirts with Bonner's picture pressed onto them. As they bowed their heads, surrounding a shrine with white candles and a wooden cross with a blue bandana tied around it, the remnants of a blue foil balloon in the tree branches crackled in the wind. It had gotten caught during the balloon release and candlelight vigil the family had hosted the week Bonner had passed. Bonner's godmother stepped out of the prayer circle as she began to cry.</p>

<p>JPD's silence on the shooting compounds this community's and family's grief. Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba put out a statement Tuesday about developing a task force to review how JPD releases names and the timeframe in which that happens in efforts to examine the "longstanding practice of not releasing the names of officers involved in shootings," the statement reads.</p>

<p>A precinct meeting at JPD headquarters held an hour after that statement came out drove home the fact that JPD does not believe in releasing names of officers who shoot civilians because they fear retaliation, with citizens at the meeting agreeing wholeheartedly. Officers encouraged attendees to speak at the City Council meeting later that night to voice their concerns—even though the matter was not on the council's agenda.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Bonner family has not been idle. Blalock spoke on behalf of the family at a Jackson City Council meeting at the end of February, holding city officials' feet to the fire and demanding an independent investigation and more details. She hopes citizens can come together the way many did for the "March for Our Lives" rally that took place the morning of the Bonner-family cleanup.</p>

<p>"If black people could organize like that, boy...," Blalock said before trailing off.</p>

<p>Richard has his demands ready, too. He wants JPD to use body cameras, and he does not believe in JPD's protocol of placing officers who shoot civilians on administrative leave because he sees it as a paid vacation. And like his cousin, he wants the community to step it up, even as far as protesting; otherwise the same things will go on, he says.</p>

<p>Although Richard said he often keeps to himself these days, he has not given up on the idea that they may one day get justice for his oldest brother. "I think with him being a convicted felon, they didn't think we were going to step up like this," he says.</p>

<p>I didn't need the murders of Jackson residents to let me know that the city is a police state. I didn't need the Lumumba administration to move in lockstep with the Jackson Police Department and refuse to hold officers accountable in the face of terror to understand that the mayor is a high-ranking official in the police state.

<p>We live in a police state.</p>

<p>That is when a government uses organized force to act arbitrarily and violently against the interests of the masses of people, rendering them subjects instead of citizens. The term encompasses the institutions of policing, prosecutor's offices, the prison system, courts, the surveillance-state apparatus and government as we currently know it.</p>

<p>Historically, governments have used that power to enforce the hegemonic rule of the State and corporate interests that a few control to the detriment of the many. Anyone who doesn't believe we live in a police state is either living in an alternative universe or has willfully blinded themselves to the reality that has beset us.</p>

<p>I didn't need the murders of Jackson residents to let me know that the city is a police state. I didn't need the Lumumba administration to move in lockstep with the Jackson Police Department and refuse to hold officers accountable in the face of terror to understand that the mayor is a high-ranking official in the police state.</p>

<p>I didn't need to see poor people's human rights systematically violated to understand that what passes for a justice system in Hinds County and throughout the state of Mississippi is a vile station of oppression and degradation. U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst didn't have to threaten Jackson's majority-black and mostly poor population with the violation of basic constitutional principles, and international human rights norms and standards to let me know it is open season on poor and black people in Jackson. These are all symptoms of a deeper malady.</p>

<p>When I reflect on the ongoing police-state violence locally, I am reminded of the timeless words of George Jackson, "... understand the reality of our situation, understand that fascism is already here, that people are already dying who could be saved, that generations more will live poor butchered half-lives if you fail to act."</p>

<p>What will it take for more of us to challenge the hegemonic rule of the police state? What will it take for us to see that the dominant narratives around crime and violence only lead us in circles? How many more people will police have to kill before we demand the upending of the status quo?</p>

<p>In the midst of this raging debate about gun control, gun violence and criminality, we must reflect deeply. Who is controlling the narrative, and where are they trying to lead us? Whose interests are "leaders" serving? What is more violent than the racially bigoted police state domestically? What is more violent than the U.S. military industrial complex globally? Martin Luther King Jr. said that the greatest purveyor of violence in the world was the U.S. government. This still rings true.</p>

<p>Our primary focus must be on state violence because that begets all other violence. We have been socialized and indoctrinated to view state violence as legitimate. It is not. We must not be led astray by hypocritical politicians and misleaders who claim to abhor violence in Jackson and other urban cities, but will go to Congress and vote for President Trump's $700-billion war budget. This kind of recklessness wreaks terror and havoc on poor and black people around the world. Governments do it in the name of greed, imperial power and the further entrenchment of the status quo.</p>

<p>We must build a grassroots movement to dismantle the police state, abolish the prison system as we know it and defund the military industrial complex.</p>

<p>When it comes to police transparency, Jackson is on a volatile tectonic plate that could cause tremors at any moment. Especially when City officials are the ones off-kilter and inconsistent.</p>

<p>Since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba brought in Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore earlier this year, there have been three officer-involved shootings, two of them fatal. On Tuesday, Lumumba announced a future task force to review the Jackson Police Department's policies of withholding the names of officers who shoot civilians. An hour later, Moore hosted a meeting at the JPD Headquarters, where his officers expressed that they are "100 percent" against identifying officers who shoot civilians with most in attendance, with attendees asking how they could support officers in this "fight." JPD encouraged attendees to speak at the city-council meeting later that evening.</p>

<p>Across town, the Bonner family could not agree less with JPD's protocol. They lost Lee Bonner after two plain-clothes detectives shot him between eight and 17 times on Feb. 21.</p>

<p>In Tuesday's meeting, the department did not hear from people who might not wholeheartedly praise everything they do—those who want to be protected and hold police accountable at the same time, to ask that JPD walk and chew gum with us.</p>

<p>Checks and balances are important in law enforcement. Citizens pay taxes for police officers to uphold their end of the bargain, not for officers to have unique protections they do not afford the citizens they have sworn to serve and protect.</p>

<p>JPD has been quick to send out mugshots of police-shooting victims and those merely accused of a crime, even juveniles, providing no details if they are later cleared. This same department refuses to see the irony in refusing to identify officers who shoot citizens.</p>

<p>Police badges do not grant the superpowers to unleash an impenetrable force field around officers who shoot civilians and taxpayers. The police are not free from criticism and reform, and neither is our mayor. Moore and Lumumba need to quickly get on the same page before apparent infighting causes an earthquake.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A federal judge in Mississippi has extended his temporary block on the most restrictive abortion law in the United States.</p>

<p>The Mississippi law bans abortion after 15 weeks. Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed it March 19. The law took effect immediately, but the state's only abortion clinic sued the state.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves issued a temporary restraining order March 20 to block the law for 10 days.</p>

<p>Reeves on Wednesday extended the block until April 13, giving attorneys for the clinic and the state more time to work on legal arguments.</p>

<p>The law and the responding lawsuit set up a confrontation sought by abortion opponents, who are hoping federal courts will ultimately prohibit abortions before a fetus is viable. Current federal law does not.</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/29/only-black-people-prosecuted-under-mississippi-gan/ </p>

<p>Mississippi Sen. Brice Wiggins sponsored an expanded gang law that failed this session. Prosecutors have used existing gang law only against African Americans since 2010. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — In the lead-up to this year's legislative session in Mississippi, supporters of a tougher gang law in the state talked a lot about the need to arrest white people. But in an ironic twist, the Jackson Free Press has learned that everyone arrested under the existing gang law from 2010 through 2017 were African American.</p>

<p>Over the last year, members of the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators worked to spread the message that not all gang members in Mississippi are African American, Hispanic or another ethnicity. In fact, they warned, many of the state's toughest gang members are now white, between the growing Simon City Royals, white supremacist groups like the Aryan Brotherhood, and biker "clubs" such as the violent Bandidos, started by a white Marine in Texas in 1966 who would later be convicted of murder.</p>

<p>How Mississippi pursues people believed to be in gangs.</p>

<p>In August 2017, MAGI told The Clarion-Ledger that 53 percent of verified gang members, a number presumably pulled from the dozens of identified criminal groups in the state, are white. It is a potentially surprising statistic in the state with the highest proportion of African Americans in the nation and that experiences a large amount of media coverage of its black and Hispanic gangs.</p>

<p>The Mississippi State Gang Assessment, published in December 2017, listed the white Simon City Royals as the third largest criminal street gang in the state behind the Black Gangster Disciples and the Vice Lords, both black gangs. In addition, MAGI members regularly provide examples of heinous crimes by white gang members, such as the murder and dismemberment of a Royals snitch on the Coast in 2016. Welford Lee McCarty is now serving a life sentence for murder charges.</p>

<p>MAGI's recent message was clear: The state's gang investigators are not fixated on black gangs and do not want the expanded gang law in order to profile young people of color. When asked to comment on the 53-percent-white report, Pascagoula District Attorney Tony Lawrence told the Jackson Free Press via email: "I have not seen that statistic and cannot comment on it, but I can say, in remembering gang cases in my office, I have prosecuted more white gang members for crimes than of any other race."</p>

<p>Prosecuting someone for a specific crime who happens to be a gang member and prosecuting someone, or adding on additional sentences, for being a member of a gang are two completely different things, however.</p>

<p>It is not talked about a lot in the push for an expanded gang law, but Mississippi already has a gang law on the books. The Mississippi Streetgang Act, passed in 2001, targets "three (3) or more persons with an established hierarchy that, through its membership or through the agency of any member, engages in felonious criminal activity." That is, much like the FBI does with the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, called RICO, the State can go after a group that conspires together to commit a criminal act. That is different from making it illegal to be part of a gang and thus being held responsible for crimes other members might commit separately, as the failed gang law this session could have done.</p>

<p>But despite MAGI frequently warning that white gang members pose a strong threat in today's Mississippi, the arrests and prosecutions under the existing street-gang law have only targeted African Americans, State Public Defender Andre de Gruy pointed out to the Jackson Free Press after the expanded gang law failed this session.</p>

<p>A full archive of the JFP's "Preventing Violence" series, supported by grants from the Solutions Journalism Network. Photo of Zeakyy Harrington by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>The Administrative Office of the Courts confirmed that from fiscal-year 2010 through 2017, court disposition data show that 97 people were processed under current gang law. All of them were black.</p>

<p>Of those 97, 22 pled guilty, four were dismissed, one faced house arrest, 11 were no-billed (dismissed), one was non-adjudicated, 53 remanded/passed to the file* and five had probation revoked, the Administrative Office of the Courts confirmed.</p>

<p>"From 2010 to 14 it was seldom used—fewer than 30 dispositions," de Gruy explained in an email. "The last two years of data indicate 32 indictments disposed of per year. These came from 5 of 22 districts but primarily from Forrest and DeSoto counties."</p>

<p>Mississippi's Administrative Office of the Courts uses the following racial/ethnic classifications: white, black, American Indian, Asian, Hispanic and unknown.</p>

<p>The State's 2017 gang-threat assessment found that 413 Simon City Royals had been in custody in DeSoto County last year, but that does not mean they were prosecuted under existing gang law. The assessment also pointed out that a Forrest County gang member, part of the 74 Hoover Crip Gang, was arrested in 2015 for capital murder and other felonies for killing two police officers. The Forrest County Corner said he died later that year in jail from heart disease. (Note: The assessment was found during the 2018 legislative session to have dramatically over-counted the number of gang members in Mississippi prisons.)</p>

<p>De Gruy, who opposed the expanded law due to both costs and the potential to profile people of color, says more information is needed to fully vet who the current gang law is already targeting. He would like more information about the dispositions under the existing law, including who was under 18 at the time of charge.</p>

<p>He also suggested that gang laws could use a way to check them for racial profiling. "[A] provision could be crafted to review the racial impact annually," de Gruy said.</p>

<p>On the Senate floor, the sponsor of this session's expanded gang bill, Senate Bill 2868, deflected concerns that expanded gang laws are used to profile Mississippians of color. ""It's not a Republican, Democrat(ic), black or white (issue)," Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, told black lawmakers during the debate.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Author's note: The data provided by the Administrative Office of the Courts listed separate numbers for "remanded to the file" and "passed to the file," which I originally included separately above. Those mean the same thing, and I have edited the above story to reflect that and added links to explain the various dispositions. I also listed the race/ethnicity categories that the office uses to categorize after a question about it. Hispanics are not included in the "white" category.</p>

<h2 id="deadoralivewhatbillssurvivedordidntinthe2018legislativesession">Dead or Alive: What Bills Survived, Or Didn't, in the 2018 Legislative Session</h2>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-29</p>

<p>A lot of bills with big-ticket items, including rewriting the state's education funding formula and diverting more money to roads and bridges, died in the 2018 legislative session. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Lawmakers went home on Wednesday, March 28, well before the Easter deadline, but not before they passed a $6-billion budget, with most state agencies receiving funding levels comparable to what they got last year.</p>

<p>Leaders diverted some additional funding to universities, public education and the State's foster-care system in the fiscal-year 2019 budget, which begins July 1. While the budget is intact, many other Republican priorities and proposals died this session. Here is a short list of what survived and what did not.</p>

<p>Bills That Survived</p>

<p>Medicaid Technical Amendment</p>

<p>Mississippi's Division of Medicaid is primed for a new era after the Senate confirmed Drew Snyder as its new director. The House and the Senate eventually agreed on language in the technical-amendment legislation that removes doctor visit and prescription-count limits so Medicaid recipients can stay healthier. The legislation also ensures that managed-care companies that provide coverage under Medicaid cover the costs for patient visits to obstetricians and gynecologists, as well as prescriptions to help prevent preterm births.</p>

<p>Re-entry and Criminal Justice Reforms</p>

<p>The governor signed House Bill 387 this week, which ensures that Mississippians do not go to jail or prison automatically just because they fail to pay fines and fees. Under the new law, judges must assess a person's ability to pay. Another re-entry bill will stop the State from suspending drivers' licenses for all drug violations that federal drug law authorizes, unless the offense involves driving under the influence of a controlled substance. Senate Bill 2841 also lengthens the amount of time a person on parole or supervision has to pay a fee to 90 days instead of 30 days. It also instructs the Mississippi Department of Corrections and judges to assess indigence before sending a person to prison for not paying their fines.</p>

<p>Bond Bill</p>

<p>Lawmakers authorized about $280 million in bonds this session for the Institutions of Higher Learning, community colleges, some State agencies and the Ingalls shipyard on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The bond bill also includes $50 million for the local bridge program. Lawmakers also approved bonds for the Mississippi Development Authority to administer business and facilities grants.</p>

<p>15-Week Abortion Ban</p>

<p>Republicans pushed a 15-week abortion ban, the first in the nation, through the statehouse earlier this month. The law was in place for less than 24 hours after the governor signed it when Jackson Women's Health Organization, the state's only abortion clinic, challenged the law in federal court. This week U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves extended the temporary restraining order against the measure to April 13.</p>

<p>Foster Care Administrative Changes</p>

<p>If Gov. Bryant signs Senate Bill 2675, Mississippi's foster-care system will be housed within but operate independently of the Department of Human Services. The merger is necessary for Child Protection Services to receive federal funding for the foster care system.</p>

<p>Bills That Died</p>

<p>Transportation Funding Plans</p>

<p>It was only a year ago when the House attempted to force a conversation with the Senate on roads and bridges on deadline night, March 27, 2017. They ultimately created a special session to pass a few budget bills. This year, the House jumped out front in road and bridges funding discussions, but their proposals were untouched until Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves introduced his "BRIDGE" Act a few days before a deadline day. Ultimately, disagreement about how to divert additional funding to infrastructure died again this year, despite the Republican supermajority.</p>

<p>Ed-Formula Re-write</p>

<p>More than a year ago EdBuild presented the Legislature with a proposal for a new weighted student funding formula to fund Mississippi's public schools. In 2017, legislative leaders did not file a bill, however. This session, House Speaker Philip Gunn did file a bill, and while it made it out of the House, it died in the Senate after enough senators voted with Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, to kill the proposal.</p>

<p>'Anti-Gang' Act</p>

<p>Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, and Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, pushed "anti-gang" legislation that would have broadened the definition of a "gang" as well as add an additional penalty and sentence for any crime proved to be "criminal gang activity," for a minimum of five years and up to 15 years in prison. The Legislative Black Caucus held a hearing on the potential costs of the bill, and the legislation ended up dying.</p>

<p>Disenfranchisement Study Committee</p>

<p>A measure to create a study committee to look at Mississippi's suffrage and disenfranchisement laws died in the Senate this year. Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, said he plans to study the current disenfrachisement laws anyway this summer. On Tuesday, five men and a class of Mississippians disenfranchised from voting brought a federal lawsuit with the Southern Poverty Law Center against Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann. They are challenging the State's disenfranchising list of crimes that prevents some Mississippians from voting forever as well as the process to gain suffrage.</p>

<h2 id="lawyerinflowoodofficerinvolvedshootingwantsvideoanswers-1">Lawyer in Flowood Officer-Involved Shooting Wants Video, Answers</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-30</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/30/lawyer-flowood-officer-involved-shooting-wants-vid/ </p>

<p>A Flowood police officer shot into Von McDavid's car at a Kroger in Flowood on the evening of March 8, 2018. His lawyer, Dow Yoder, wants more details and for video to be released. Photo courtesy Flowood Police Department</p>

<p>JACKSON — On the evening of March 8, a Flowood Police Department officer unloaded his gun into Von McDavid's car somewhere between four and eight times. McDavid had gone to the exterior walk-up pharmacy at a nearby Kroger shortly before they were closing, and an employee there suspected McDavid of obtaining medication unlawfully, his lawyer, Dow Yoder, said.</p>

<p>An officer met McDavid in the parking lot, and then the story gets murky depending on who is telling it. Flowood Police Chief Richie McCluskey said in a statement released that same night that a preliminary investigation showed the responding officer attempted to arrest McDavid, who got into his vehicle and tried to run over the arresting officer.</p>

<p>"Our officer shot into the car, fearing for his life while attempting to get out of harm's way as the suspect continued through the parking lot and eventually crashed into a ditch near the intersection of Lakeland Drive and Grants Ferry Rd," McCluskey said in the statement.</p>

<p>The attorney representing McDavid, Yoder, contests that his client had committed a misdemeanor or felony crime to warrant arrest in the first place, let alone the use of deadly force. Yoder is a former assistant district attorney for Madison and Rankin counties and a former special assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Yoder told the Jackson Free Press that an officer approached McDavid, yelling and with his hands on a pistol, so McDavid got back in the car. He said the officer was standing about 3 feet from the passenger headlight of the car when McDavid cranked his car up and the officer drew his pistol.</p>

<p>His client was "freaking out," Yoder said, and felt like the officer was looking for an excuse to shoot him because he hadn't done anything wrong, adding when McDavid tried to put his hand on the gear shift, the officer unloaded. Yoder said McDavid turned his car away from the officer and drove off into a nearby ditch because "he figured that was better than being still and letting the officer kill him."</p>

<p>McDavid apparently told Yoder that when some officers came to that ditch, he felt they were "just looking at him hoping he was going to die in the ditch before the ambulance got there," he said in the interview.</p>

<p>McDavid was transported to the University of Mississippi Medical Center intensive care unit that night. Now he is at his mother's house recovering. Yoder said on Thursday he had spoken with McDavid's mother, whom he describes as a "sweet, wonderful Christian lady," and that she said her son's emotional and psychological injuries at this point are just as detrimental to him as the gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>The approach of giving officers wide discretion on whether to fire into a moving vehicle is not considered a national best practice for policing. The Police Executive Research Forum released a report in March 2016, "Guiding Principles on Use of Force," warning about the high dangers of shooting into moving vehicles.</p>

<p>Police officers shooting into moving vehicles has drawn national scrutiny in the United States due to the dangers it poses and not only to the driver. Law-enforcement experts warn that not only the targeted driver be injured or killed, but that an out-of-control vehicle then poses dangers to both the officers as well as bystanders and property. Officers should "move" out of the path of moving vehicles, policing experts advise, if at all possible and then follow specific procedures that should be part of their training.</p>

<p>Whether or not McDavid commited a crime is not clear, especially with the few details the Flowood Police Department has offered to date other than that the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations has stepped in to investigate. Yoder says a Flowood city clerk told him that his client does not face any pending charges so far.</p>

<p>The Flowood Police Department has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Jackson Free Press nor replied to voicemails left on various department's machines. Yoder laments the lack of transparency in this process.</p>

<p>"[I]t is very likely that now the Flowood Police Department is scrambling around trying to come up with evidence to justify what happened that they did not know about, and they did not have at the time (that) they used this unreasonably forceable pursuit and apprehension of apparently just someone they thought was suspicious."</p>

<p>Yoder's best hope is getting his hands on some video from either body cameras and/or Kroger video surveillance because without it, it is McDavid's word against the officer's.</p>

<p>"If there's not any clear video evidence that shows what really happens, guess who that favors? That favors the Flowood Police Department. Why? Because then it makes it a swearing match between one Flowood police officer and a suspect," Yoder told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"Most people are going to believe the police officer," he added. "But when a police officer shoots at a car, nine times and shoots somebody six times (who) was not under arrest at the time of the shooting, and at the time of the shooting there was no probable cause to make an arrest, then obviously that police officer is going to have a motive to justify what we did—and he's going to have an awfully hard time doing it."</p>

<h2 id="lawmakersturntobudgetsreentryreformsongovernorsdesk">Lawmakers Turn to Budgets; Re-Entry Reforms on Governor’s Desk</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-21</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/21/lawmakers-turn-budgets-re-entry-reforms-governors-/ </p>

<p>Lawmakers sent Gov. Phil Bryant (pictured) a measure that will expand re-entry reforms in the state’s criminal-justice system. Bryant has until March 26 to sign the measure; he vetoed a similar bill last year. Trip Burns/File Photo</p>

<p>JACKSON — It's crunch time at the Mississippi Capitol. This week lawmakers will have to finalize the state budget, predominantly behind closed doors, before passing a slim fiscal-year 2019 budget. So far, legislators plan to spend about $70 million less than they did last year, House of Representative budget documents show.</p>

<p>Representatives, so far, appear willing to increase funding for the Mississippi Adequate Education Program this session, despite Republicans' failed attempts to re-write the education funding formula. The Senate budget proposal does not increase funding for education, however.</p>

<p>The House budget also calls for enough funding to keep the Mississippi Department of Mental Health at the same budget levels as last year. The U.S. Department of Justice is currently litigating a case against the state for its over-reliance on institutionalization in mental-health care.</p>

<p>Lawmakers will be forced to make tough decisions this week, however, as the lawsuit against the state's foster-care system, called "Olivia Y," requires more than $35 million than what is currently allocated for the agency, as the new commissioner told reporters last week. Without those funds, the still relatively new division of Child Protection Services could risk going into federal receivership.</p>

<p>Bills to Watch This Week</p>

<p>This measure authorizes the Division of Medicaid, and six lawmakers will work to come to a compromise between the House and Senate positions. Both chambers support allowing Medicaid to cover opioid and other drug-addiction support services. Lawmakers will likely make decisions about the number of hospital admissions and increasing the number of prescriptions for Medicaid recipients in their conference report for this bill.</p>

<p>Last year, lawmakers were forced into a special session after the two chambers could not agree on transportation funding. The House has thrown out myriad proposals, and this year Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves decided to introduce his own proposal, called the "BRIDGE Act."</p>

<p>That bill, which includes some bonds for infrastructure needs as well as creates two new state funds to target road and bridge funding, could mean $1 billion for infrastructure in the next five years—if revenue meets certain triggers, specifically more than a 1-percent increase in sales tax growth. The measure includes $240 million in immediate funds for infrastructure. House Bill 354 would also divert any surplus funds above 2-percent growth to infrastructure needs in the state.</p>

<p>Both transportation funding measures are in conference, and senators and representatives will have to agree on how much money to set aside for roads and bridges.</p>

<p>What started as a means to ensure that Mississippians with enhanced-carry licenses can carry firearms on campuses, including in athletic events, has turned into a measure to allow schools to establish "safety programs" as well as slightly tightening state gun laws. The author of the measure, Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, indicated on social media that he is not open to some of the Senate's changes. "Bottom line: a new restriction of existing concealed carry rights is something I just cannot support. I doubt that surprises anybody," he wrote on Facebook. This measure is likely to go to conference, if the House chooses to keep it alive. The deadline for the House to concur with the changes the Senate made is Thursday.</p>

<p>Re-Entry Bill on Governor's Desk</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant has until Monday, March 26, to sign House Bill 387. This year clergy and conservative groups, including Right on Crime, supported the bill, which will keep Mississippians out of jail if they cannot afford to pay fines or fees. The measure will allow lawmakers and groups of public officials to continue studying disparities in the state's criminal-justice system, including how judges issue sentences for various crimes. The bill also gives judges the option to deviate from the "habitual offender" law, offering an explanation if they do not want to give the maximum sentence state law requires for a Mississippian's "third strike."</p>

<h2 id="ohtheplacesyoullgoprojectejectexpelsgunoffenderstofarawayprisons">Oh, the Places You'll Go: Project EJECT Expels Gun Offenders to Faraway Prisons</h2>

<p>U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst announced Project EJECT (Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together) on Dec. 7, 2018, with then-Jackson Police Chief to his right and Christopher Freeze, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Jackson, to his left. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>In November 2017, Ledarious Anderson apparently thought he was going on a date with a woman named Alexus Guster, but he was headed to a set-up. Two men, Darrell Moore and Cedric Winfield, allegedly told Guster that she would receive a portion of the take from a robbery if she could get Anderson to meet up with her. Guster agreed and lured Anderson via Facebook, an affidavit shows.</p>

<p>Guster told Anderson to meet her at the Arbor Park Apartments near Clinton, where she stood waiting with Winfield, whom she introduced as her brother when Anderson pulled up in his 1999 red Pontiac Grand Am. Guster and Winfield talked to Anderson from his passenger side, and while he was distracted, Moore came to the driver's window with a firearm. Moore pulled Anderson out of the car and took $200, court documents say.</p>

<p>Anderson apparently ran away as Moore shot at him. Winfield then drove off in the stolen Grand Am, and Guster left with Moore in his car, authorities say.</p>

<p>But it wasn't just the robbery, or the aiding and abetting, or the shooting that landed the trio in federal court, where they are much more likely to be sent away to faraway prisons outside Mississippi. Rather, the fact that the Grand Am had been transported, shipped and received through interstate commerce—meaning it crossed a state line—makes Guster, Moore and Winfield early offenders charged under U.S. Attorney Michael Hurst's "Project EJECT."</p>

<p>"Carjacking is a federal crime because the car was manufactured in interstate commerce," Hurst said in his office in February. Thus, so was a plan to steal a vehicle made outside the state in this local incident.</p>

<p>Hurst has charged 32 others since he first announced the anti-crime initiative in late 2017, like Bobby Ray Mahone and Latesha Vavuris, who allegedly held up a Family Dollar store in October 2017. Like the other case, it is not robbery per se that put them within Hurst's jurisdiction rather than the more typical route of state or local criminal charges, even for acts committed with guns. Their robbery allegedly interfered with interstate commerce because customers from outside the state can purchase items inside the store.</p>

<p>Every single case Hurst is pursuing under Project EJECT involves illegal use or possession of firearms in some way under an initiative U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has resuscitated from the years before Barack Obama became president.</p>

<p>'Making America Safe Again'</p>

<p>On a cool, breezy and overcast morning this past December, U.S. Attorney Hurst called a press conference on the steps of the U.S. District Court in downtown Jackson. President Donald Trump had appointed Hurst in a second wave of U.S. attorney nominees and described him as sharing "the President's vision for 'Making America Safe Again,'" the June 29, 2017, White House announcement reads.</p>

<p>A sign with a large red button and "Project Eject" written across the center leaned on a tripod easel. He had invited media, Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith, Hinds County Sheriff Victor Mason, FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Freeze, and clergy to stand by him as he unveiled Project EJECT (Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together).</p>

<p>"Today is a new day," Hurst began, adding, "(T)he message to violent criminals in Jackson is simple: you break the law, you terrorize our neighborhoods and you will be ejected from our community."</p>

<p>Hurst's goal to "eject" violent criminals into federal court and then prisons outside the state is much like Project Exile in Richmond, Va., in the 1990s, which sent felons into "exile" for firearm violations. Freeze of the FBI, in fact, worked for the agency in Richmond at the time, back when James Comey was the U.S. attorney leading the program there. Freeze started pushing a version of Exile in Mississippi soon after he arrived in late 2016.</p>

<p>"Project Exile was founded and based on the concept that if you're a convicted felon, caught in commission of a crime, with a weapon, there's a five-year automatic sentence to federal prison," Freeze told WDAM in Hattiesburg in April 2017.</p>

<p>"I've talked to some of our partners in the Jackson area and some of our state partners to kind of hear them out and see if they think it would be viable," Freeze said then. "The U.S. Attorney's Office would be a big part of that, so certainly their willingness and ability to be a partner in that regard will be something we are discussing and will further discuss with them."</p>

<p>Freeze found a willing partner in Hurst, who said on Dec. 7 that a dozen special agents from both federal and state agencies had already begun collaborating with local law enforcement and going out to crime scenes with JPD officers to identify crimes he can prosecute. Those cases go to Hurst's office, and a task force determines if there is enough evidence to prosecute suspects in the federal system. Hurst said then that authorities will lock suspects up immediately in detention without bond, and law enforcement will not cut a deal so the suspect could be out in a few months.</p>

<p>Here's where the ejection comes. Once convicted, the theory goes, the felon would spend time without parole in the federal system "far, far away from Mississippi so that they cannot continue their criminal activity behind bars," Hurst said in December. The federal system no longer offers parole.</p>

<p>The idea is that the criminals would be away from their criminal networks and, thus, be likely to commit less crime. They would also be removed from their families and existing support networks while in prisons known for rough gang activity, a problem even Hurst described in an interview.</p>

<p>The state involvement comes at the hands of DA Smith, who committed to provide cases that can be prosecuted federally in order to free up the his resources. He is scheduled to face trial himself in Rankin County in September 2018 for domestic-related felonies involving a firearm.</p>

<p>Then-Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance also stood next to Hurst at the announcement to show support for the initiative. Vance, who later resigned at the end of 2017, said at Hurst's press conference that his "greatest wish" for the strategy is that a young man in Jackson rethinks a life of crime and will rethink his actions after watching others go to federal prison "for a long time, perhaps thousands of miles away from here."</p>

<p>Vance's replacement, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore, has been tight-lipped on virtually everything, including Project EJECT, despite the Jackson Free Press' requests to interview him since he took over the position on Jan. 2.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has offered few public statements on Project EJECT, despite public criticism of it. The same day the interim chief was announced, Lumumba told the Jackson Free Press that he and Moore had not yet had a chance to discuss it, but the mayor emphasized that the two spoke about ensuring good relationships between police and community.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, citizens are forcing a public conversation about Project EJECT.</p>

<p>City's 'Sphere of Influence'</p>

<p>Calandra Davis approached the wooden podium during the time allotted for public comments at the Jackson City Council meeting on Feb. 27. She said she moved back to Jackson a year ago and is not pleased with local policing strategies—including Project EJECT.</p>

<p>Jacksonian Calandra Davis expressed her dissatisfaction with Project Eject in Jackson over the last year at a city council meeting on February 27, 2018.</p>

<p>"During my time back, the police in the City have implemented the Project EJECT program, and there have been at least seven officer-involved shootings," Davis said. "And to realize that this program and these shootings affect African-Americans disproportionately should raise concern for all of us...."</p>

<p>When Davis finished, the mayor wanted to clarify the City's involvement with Hurst's brainchild.</p>

<p>"Project EJECT is (not) and has never been an initiative of the City," Lumumba said. "... This administration has never said it is in favor of Project EJECT, we have never made any comments on Project EJECT. In my opinion, it may be out of our sphere of influence. What our police department is tasked with doing is investigating cases."</p>

<p>The mayor added that the City can neither make the feds prosecute cases nor stop them from prosecuting them in either federal or state court. He did, however, offer some criticism of Hurst's approach.</p>

<p>"I will say that some of the comments that were made during the (Hurst) press conference where it talked about people not getting bonds and everything else was inappropriate," the mayor said then. "I don't think that it is even within the sphere of influence of the people who said it because a prosecutor doesn't dictate whether somebody gets a bond—a judge dictates whether somebody gets a bond."</p>

<p>Hurst agreed with that statement in his office in February, backtracking from the promises of his earlier press conference. "Oh, yeah, people have misconstrued what I said at the press conference," he said. "... We are only a part of the judicial process, and our part will be to move for detention." He pushed back on the suggestion this his promises meant violating people's rights to bond; they will suggest no bond, he said. "We're moving for detention, and the judge makes a decision based upon the facts."</p>

<p>Hurst also made it clear in his office that he knows the federal system does not offer parole, so it cannot be rescinded.</p>

<p>At council, Calandra Davis also wanted to know if the mayor was explicitly in favor of Project EJECT, which is focusing solely inside Jackson and in no other parts of the state so far, Hurst said. Council President Charles Tillman of Ward 5 did not let the mayor respond, grunting into the microphone to vocalize his disapproval, and shaking his head "no" to illustrate it further. The mayor did not get to speak further on the EJECT strategy.</p>

<p>But, before he was interrupted, Lumumba added that Project EJECT is a federal initiative from three or four years ago, when former U.S. Attorney Gregory Davis was in office, which he had told the Jackson Free Press earlier, saying it was a program the Obama appointee oversaw.</p>

<p>In his office, Hurst also pointed out that Davis had used the same approach as EJECT but by a different name. "My predecessor Greg Davis had really focused on violent crime his last few years in Jackson," Hurst said. "I'm really building off what he had started and with direction from the president and Attorney General Sessions. They really wanted to make violent crime a focus of this administration."</p>

<p>For Sessions, that meant bringing back a controversial approach to prosecuting gun crimes federally with mandatory sentencing as part of the innocuous-sounding, but highly controversial, Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative, which predated Obama and Davis and drew charges of racial bias.</p>

<p>The divide between police and black communities is about more than white cops.</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of a better place to start that here in the Southern District of Mississippi than in Jackson," Hurst said in February. "Seeing what Greg had done and how federal law enforcement in particular had worked with the state and locals, we thought it would be good to reboot the old Project Safe Neighborhoods into our own initiative called Project EJECT."</p>

<p>Obama Era to Trump Era</p>

<p>Former U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Davis said Project EJECT is not, in fact, the exact same, and added some nuance to both Lumumba and Hurst's use of his name to justify the enforcement approach.</p>

<p>"There have always been, sort of, initiatives in place to address violent crime," Davis said in a March 13 interview. "And I think the Jackson Violent Crime Initiative that we started ... was kind of a prelude to some of these initiatives that are going on now. I think (Project) EJECT may have just been an initiative with the current administration. They may have changed it up somewhat, but it's still a program to address violent crime."</p>

<p>Davis said his iteration did not specifically threaten to send convicted criminals far away from Mississippi. Even if a judge recommends people serve time as close to Jackson as possible, the Yazoo City facility is the state's only federal prison for them. The other federal prison, in Adams County, is mainly used for immigration. So, people would likely go beyond state boundaries if convicted of federal gun crimes. That's just the nature of the prison system, Davis said.</p>

<p>"We didn't come out and say 'we're going to eject you from the City of Jackson,'" Davis said. "Our issue was more so that violent people need to be prosecuted, the law needs to be enforced, and once they're sentenced, they will be sent to a prison. More than likely that would be at a different location other than a local area."</p>

<p>Davis' Violent Crime Initiative aimed to remove violent offenders from the streets to make communities safer. A lot of the charges under his initiative were similar to the ones Hurst is pursuing. Forty percent of the people charged under Hurst's Project EJECT as of Feb. 26 were felons in possession of a weapon. In a press release from August 2015, seven of the 10 people listed for either charges or indictments under Davis' Violent Crime Initiative were previously convicted felons in possession of a firearm. Five of those 10 people are serving time in federal prisons now.</p>

<p>By Stephen Wilson</p>

<p>At either a judge's recommendation or luck of the draw, some of the aforementioned 10 went to Yazoo City. Others went to Arkansas, West Virginia, Florida or Georgia. Davis did not set out to have people who commit violent crimes sent far away like Hurst; that is where they landed.</p>

<p>Davis explained that federal-local partnerships to rein in violence are not new; they get recycled and rebranded with each new administration. He modeled his policies toward violent crime after national initiatives from Obama-era U.S. Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.</p>

<p>Holder launched a "Smart on Crime" initiative in 2013 to de-prioritize prosecuting non-violent crime and encouraged U.S. attorneys to use scarce federal resources mainly for violence prevention to help prevent the crime before it happened rather than rely on the threat of arrest and prison, which can actually lead to worse crime.</p>

<p>To that end, Lynch added Jackson to the Violence Reduction Network, which the U.S. Department of Justice framed as a "comprehensive program" to leverage resources and provide a "hands-on approach" to reducing violence in targeted cities across the nation. Little came of it here because it was late in the Obama administration. The City has not announced any programs or resources associated with it since Sessions became attorney general.</p>

<p>Hurst's initiative is more consistent with Sessions' law-and-order, tough-on-crime positions, which focus on enforcement over prevention, at least so far.</p>

<p>In February 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing Sessions to establish and to appoint or designate an individual or individuals to chair a task force on crime reduction and public safety.</p>

<p>"A focus on law and order and the safety and security of the American people requires a commitment to enforcing the law and developing policies that comprehensively address illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and violent crime," the order reads.</p>

<p>By June 2017, Sessions had his partnership in place to go after gun violence. In October 2017, Sessions sent a memo to all U.S. attorneys reviving Project Safe Neighborhoods, a George W. Bush-era initiative he deemed successful, which had cost the government about $2 billion since its inception in 2001.</p>

<p>That strategy propelled Hurst's office to secure indictments such as Guster's, Moore's and Winfield's under Project EJECT rather than allow them to go to state court. When asked if he was fearful or hopeful about how things will go in the U.S. Attorney's office now, Davis seemed torn.</p>

<p>"I'm both," Davis said. "I'm hopeful the good things we did will continue, and ..." Davis paused for a beat, choosing not to delve into any qualms he may have had. "Let's just say, I'm hopeful that it will continue," he added.</p>

<p>Ceasefire Fires Back</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Hurst, who comes across as perennially cheerful, now has the Project EJECT sign on an easel outside his office in the sleek federal courthouse building in downtown Jackson. In February, he explained the inspiration behind Project EJECT.</p>

<p>How Police Can (and Cannot) Deter Gunfire</p>

<p>"On the prosecution side, we're not reinventing the wheel," he explained. "We're taking a lot of what has been done in other cities, whether it be Richmond (Va.) with Project Exile or Boston with (Operation) Ceasefire or Baton Rouge. A lot of cities have done this—focusing federal resources on local violent crime."</p>

<p>The violence expert who helped design Operation Ceasefire—which launched as the Boston Gun Project in 1996—did not mince words a couple weeks later when asked about Project EJECT and its earlier models in Richmond, Va., Rochester, N.Y., and other cities in the U.S.</p>

<p>David Kennedy disdains Project Safe Neighborhoods as an anti-violence approach, calling Sessions' crime strategies "evidence-free", despite violence statistics its proponents cite to prove otherwise. Not to mention, he said, strategies like EJECT and Exile have little to do with his Ceasefire approach, which is often referred to as the "Kennedy model" of violence deterrence.</p>

<p>"One of the innumerable mistakes is to say that Project Safe Neighborhood was built on Kennedy's work," Kennedy said in his office at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York where he is a professor. "... That's not right. It was in a small way based on my stuff. ... We produced the first research that really showed there was such a thing as illicit markets in firearms."</p>

<p>But the approach that became Project Exile under U.S. Attorney James Comey in Richmond ignored vital aspects of his team's work to decrease group violence, Kennedy said, calling his work "a partnership approach focused on groups."</p>

<p>"The other (approach) was Exile, which actually has its roots in opposition to my work," Kennedy added.</p>

<p>Unlike Operation Ceasefire, Project Safe Neighborhoods declined to focus on how violent people get firearms, whether legally or illegally. The Exile approach, which was also endorsed by the National Rifle Association, puts the prosecutorial onus on the street-level shooters with little attention to where the supply of weapons came from or how to stop it. That led to charges of racial disparities, and contributed to increased distrust between police and communities of color, Kennedy said.</p>

<p>The Operation Ceasefire approach, which Kennedy's team now brings to cities through the National Network for Safe Communities, is about prior engagement with those believed likely to commit gun violence, offering them help and services, and also threatening them with arrest on the state or federal levels if they or their associates commit violence. It is also about identifying illicit markets for weapons. And those trafficking the weapons aren't usually the young black people who get caught up in federal Exile-type enforcement.</p>

<p>Initially, the NRA liked his approach, Kennedy said, but redirected its support away from a program that identified illicit markets to supporting the street-level federal arrests the Bush administration adopted. Those arrests sent a disparate number of people of color to a gang-packed prison thousands of miles away for additional years, while not bothering to also focus on how they got the guns in the first place. Kennedy also said the federal prosecutions were brought unevenly, deepening distrust in communities toward law enforcement.</p>

<p>In his office, Hurst backed away from Ceasefire when asked if his alliance was also including the services and prevention side of the strategy, as Kennedy's approach requires. "It's really not something, that aspect of Ceasefire, we have not really considered. (EJECT is) really going to be more in line with Exile. It's almost Exile Plus in the sense of Exile was very strong. But I don't know how much of the prevention and, yeah, re-entry they did, but it's hard to argue with their numbers during the time."</p>

<p>Kennedy does argue with the numbers of Richmond's Exile and all its clones. Violent gun crime did fall dramatically in Richmond then, but it did not in other cities that emulated the strategy, raising his suspicion that more was going on, he said.</p>

<p>"The reason we know Exile doesn't work is ... because there's a small body of really good formal evaluations ... that say it doesn't work," Kennedy said. "I'm not aware of any place where (Exile) was associated with violent crime reduction."</p>

<p>"What else was going in Richmond at the time? Was there something else that accounted for the reduction?" he added.</p>

<p>Jackson ostensibly tried an Operation Ceasefire approach at one time called "MACE" supposedly modeled on Baton Rouge's BRAVE strategy, but a Jackson Free Press investigation found that local law enforcement just left out the services and outreach components and used the resources for massive enforcement, which violates the principles of Ceasefire.</p>

<p>'The More That You Learn'</p>

<p>Wearing the red-and-white top hat illustrated in Dr. Seuss' "The Cat in the Hat," U.S. Attorney Hurst posed with Jackson Public School students at Johnson Elementary School for Read Across America Day on March 2. In his later tweet with snapshots next to the majority-black class, Hurst quoted from a different Seuss book.</p>

<p>"The more that you read, the more things you will know," the U.S. attorney tweeted. "The more that you learn, the more places you'll go."</p>

<p>It was the second school visit Hurst had made in two weeks. On Feb. 21, he spoke at a Teen Town Hall meeting hosted by Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a subsidiary of Washington D.C.-based Council for Strong America at Jim Hill High School with Interim Jackson Police Chief Anthony Moore.</p>

<p>Hurst also tweeted after that event, which students there say did not focus on Project EJECT, with a nod to his new initiative. "You can do absolutely anything you put your mind to!" Hurst wrote on Feb. 21. "Empowering Jackson Expelling Crime TOGETHER #ProjectEject."</p>

<p>Juan Cloy, a former Jackson police officer who was assigned to the FBI's Safe Streets Task Force, is the Mississippi project director of Fight Crime, a nonprofit to help prevent youth crime. Cloy was at Jim Hill and said the event went pretty well.</p>

<p>"The whole gist of it is to first of all bring youth and police closer so they can have some common ground and some understanding of what each other needs from each other," Cloy said in February.</p>

<p>Cloy said Hurst showed up at the town hall because he cares, and that conversations between law enforcement officials and children help build trust. Cloy said the event was an informational dialogue rather than a scare tactic, per se.</p>

<p>Still, "Hurst said in the town hall (that) he didn't want to see young kids going to federal prison, Cloy recalled.</p>

<p>The conversation did include what can happen when someone enters the federal system. Cloy said he did not know about the accuracy of Hurst's threats about prison at the December EJECT announcement. From Cloy's experience, particularly with repeat offenders he arrested on the federal task force, a lot of prisoners ended up going to the federal prison in Yazoo City. Where you end up just depends on the judge and the Bureau of Prisons, Cloy said.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, Cloy said, no one would need to go to prison. He wants to approach the justice system with the kind of equilibrium David Kennedy talks about—balancing the stick of arrest with compassion and programs that preempt people from entering the system, especially kids.</p>

<p>"So what we're trying to do is keep young people from even being introduced into the federal system or into the local or state system...," Cloy said.</p>

<p>"That way we don't have to worry about any acronyms at all, right?"</p>

<p>Former U.S. Attorney Gregory Davis said Project EJECT differs somewhat from his violent-crime initiative.</p>

<p>Greg Davis agrees. While in office, the former U.S. attorney had an initiative called LEAD: Mississippi's Legal Enrichment and Decision Making Program. Through it, he spoke to students around the state about staying on the right path—but still focusing on what would happen if they did not.</p>

<p>"One of my primary goals as a prosecutor is to prevent crimes from happening in the first place," Davis told a group of students at N.R. Burger Middle School in Hattiesburg in October 2014.</p>

<p>"Educating students about the social and legal consequences of their decisions is essential to reducing negative behavior and making our communities safe," he added.</p>

<p>Hope and Consequences</p>

<p>When Hurst announced Project EJECT, he grinned as he drew connections between his initiative and basketball—particularly what happens when you commit a foul against another player.</p>

<p>"Goodness knows, I had my fair share of fouls," Hurst said in December. "But, if you intentionally, flagrantly violate the rules, you will be ejected. That's the consequence. What we're announcing today with Project EJECT are consequences, but also hope."</p>

<p>Hurst added that even if you get ejected from a basketball game, you don't have to leave the sport for life. Rather, you can come back the next game and abide by the rules. He sees the same thing happening for people sentenced far from home under Project EJECT.</p>

<p>"Come back after you serve your sentence, be rehabilitated, abide by our rules, and we will welcome you back with open arms in our community," Hurst said.</p>

<p>Not everyone who has been in prison or involved with efforts to rehabilitate criminals takes such a rosy approach, however, especially to sending prisoners far away from their families and expecting them to come back as better citizens ready to work.</p>

<p>John Koufos, the national director of re-entry initiatives for the Koch family-funded Right on Crime, was in Jackson recently to urge conservatives to support prison reform and re-entry. A former felon in New Jersey, Koufos slammed the idea of ejecting offenders to another state.</p>

<p>"Many times ... you've got people locked up all over the country. How are you supposed to re-integrate these folks back into the community when they're in Kansas?" he said at the Old Capitol Inn.</p>

<p>Hurst holds firm, though, that the threat of being shipped away can lower violence. "That's kind of the deterrent effect that we're looking at here. I understand the opposing arguments that, and that's definitely a concern," he said in his office.</p>

<p>Promising ejection is key to the strategy, Hurst emphasized. "The thinking behind that is to send a message that we're going to eject you from our community," Hurst said in his office. "I know that's tough love, but it's combined with the fact that if you want to come back and follow along, we really will help you re-enter society. It can't just be tough love; it's got to be that (promise of help)."</p>

<p>Re-entry: Trend or Reality?</p>

<p>The non-law enforcement piece of Project EJECT involves the faith-based community, nonprofits, neighborhood associations and businesses, Hurst said. In fact, local stakeholders represent the "T" in EJECT—together. Hurst wants business owners to give people a second chance once they have served their time and returned.</p>

<p>He does talk about getting to the root cause of crime through prevention, education, rehabilitation, communication and collaboration, but it is not built into Project EJECT with federal resources and strategies behind it. Hurst made his limitations clear, and leaned on the community behind him instead to achieve better communities.</p>

<p>"We don't have all the answers, guys," Hurst said in December. "Project EJECT is fluid, flexible for a reason so we can adapt to the changes and circumstances, and frankly rely upon the expertise of these men and women standing behind me."</p>

<p>Jeff Sessions has been less clear, quiet even, on re-entry, especially when compared to his predecessors. In his October 2017 Safe Neighborhoods memo, Sessions promised a "comprehensive approach" to public safety, including prevention, enforcement and re-entry efforts. But he mentions re-entry only twice, and suggested supporting locally based groups' re-entry efforts, as Hurst later echoed.</p>

<p>That is, the feds bring the big stick, and locals fund the prevention carrot.</p>

<p>Both Holder and Lynch had zeroed in on re-entry efforts as well. Lynch, in particular, had a National Re-entry Week that Davis implemented here in Jackson, he said. He stressed the importance of re-entry efforts for both the offender and the citizens in community.</p>

<p>"Re-entry is important because what happens is this," Davis said before pausing and releasing a long sigh. "Once someone has paid their debt to society, they need to have an opportunity to re-enter society and be a productive member.</p>

<p>"If they re-enter society and they're not prepared, unable to get a job, unable to have a driver's license, unable to get health care needs, unable to get whatever services that they should have to allow them to be productive, then they run the risk of re-offending."</p>

<p>Recidivism after spending time in violent prisons is an epidemic. "If somebody re-offends, they have another victim ..." Davis said. "And that's one way you reduce crime, by not having people who get out re-offend."</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Phillip Goff, co-founder and president of the Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, delved into the risks of removing people from their social supports by way of federal projects like EJECT.</p>

<p>The criminal-legal system tends to be comprised of the poorest, most vulnerable, poorly educated, least advantaged and least connected to opportunities, and those prosecuting them do not tend to be of that demographic, he said in a phone interview.</p>

<p>"The people making decisions about removing folks, shunning folks, and excommunicating them from their homes are often not the same people who are in community with those committing crimes," Goff said. "That's a fundamental flaw with the way that we handle the criminal-legal system right now."</p>

<p>Goff does not consider programs like EJECT that remove people from their support networks to be forward-looking; rather, they make re-integration more problematic, he said.</p>

<p>"What are the chances of when that person gets out, their lives can be transformed?" Goff said.</p>

<p>"Who among us ... can be removed from social networks and become better for it? Any policy that removes someone from their social support is not a policy that is aimed at making them more likely to succeed when they re-enter...."</p>

<p>Thirteen people are going to trial in the next two months before a federal jury of their peers to decide whether they will be among the first ejected from Jackson under the strategy that Hurst, Freeze and Sessions embrace, with support from the City of Jackson.</p>

<p>Alexus Guster already took a plea deal for her part in the car theft, but Cedric Winfield and Darrell Moore will go to trial on May 8, and if found guilty, they could be off and away, far from their families.</p>

<h2 id="editorialpublicofficialsgetfactsstraightonprojecteject">EDITORIAL: Public Officials, Get Facts Straight on Project EJECT</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Editorial Board</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-21</p>

<p>There are two sides to the proverbial Project EJECT coin: what the public hears and what actually happens. In December, Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst announced the initiative and the meaning behind his acronym: Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together. Since then, Jacksonians either get minimal information, or public officials have just been wrong.</p>

<p>Hurst frames Project EJECT as a violent-crime fixer. He promises safer streets by sending Jacksonians who qualify for federal charges to faraway federal prisons, revoking their bond and parole.</p>

<p>The U.S. attorney cannot deny bond or parole himself and admitted later there is no parole in the federal system, and hasn't been since the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. He also cites Operation Ceasefire as a model for EJECT, but was not clear on what it actually involves. Not to mention, its primary designer is clear that EJECT is very different from the Ceasefire approach.</p>

<p>When Hurst announced the project, he alluded to some of the most heinous gun crimes committed in Jackson in the last few years: the Kingston Frazier case and the ambushed woman shot at a red light last summer. But those suspects are charged in those crimes, and in reality, this project has targeted felons in possession of a firearm for almost half the cases as of Feb. 26.</p>

<p>Then there are our local officials. Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba claims the City is not involved with EJECT, although Jacksonians' tax-funded police department has been a named participant in this initiative since former Police Chief Lee Vance helped announce it. Interim Chief Anthony Moore, is tight-lipped on it. And DA Robert Smith is facing his own gun-related felony.</p>

<p>Lumumba also said EJECT is the same program former U.S. Attorney Greg Davis implemented under President Obama. That is not precise, either, nor does Hurst's approach include the preventive measures that Davis embraced. Project EJECT is a City initiative as long as JPD helps implement it. It's that simple.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippians accused of felonies who cannot afford their own representation have the right to counsel and a speedy trial under the 6th Amendment, but a new report found that access to adequate representation across 10 Mississippi counties is lacking and far from consistent.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Public Defender Task Force released a 100-plus-page report today, produced by the Sixth Amendment Center, detailing how indigent defense plays out in 10 county-court systems in the state including Hinds, DeSoto, Forrest, Adams and Pearl River counties.</p>

<p>"I feel very strongly that Mississippi would benefit in multiple ways from a well- organized and adequately funded state defender system so we wouldn't have great disparity in the quality of legal representation in different parts of the state," Mississippi Supreme Court Justice James W. Kitchens, chairman of the Public Defender Task Force, said in a press release.</p>

<p>The report found that the state has no way of ensuring that local counties and governments are guaranteeing effective representation for indigent Mississippians accused in felony cases in the trial courts. Often, judges select inexperienced attorneys to represent these defendants, the report found.</p>

<p>"Even an attorney newly graduated from law school and having just passed the bar examination can be assigned to represent an indigent defendant in the most serious of non-capital felony cases where the defendant faces life in prison if convicted," the report says.</p>

<p>The report, which took three years of research to complete, also found what other advocates have long said about the pre-trial detention in the state. In the 10 courts studied, defendants charged with felonies experienced a long delay the authors describe as a "black hole" between the time of arrest and arraignment and then the grand-jury indictment.</p>

<p>"On average the delay between arrest and grand jury indictment in the 10 studied counties range from two months to over a year," the report says.</p>

<p>In 2017, the ACLU, MacArthur Justice Center and the 8th Circuit Court District Attorney's office, along with the judges in that district, in Mississippi reached a settlement agreement to ensure that every person has a right to pre-trial representation. That agreement affects Leake, Neshoba, Scott and Newton counties.</p>

<p>The re-entry council's suggested changes are on the governor's desk to sign. House Bill 387 creates the Mississippi Sentencing Disparity Task Force to study the disparities in sentences judges give for the same crimes throughout the state.</p>

<p>The report outlines several recommendations for the Legislature to create a state-level entity that would create and monitor standards for public defenders statewide.</p>

<p>State Defender Andre de Gruy, a member of the task force, said his office is responsible for developing plans for a statewide public defender system.</p>

<p>"We believe this comprehensive study of our current statewide practices will demonstrate the urgency of our task," he said in a press release.</p>

<p>"Every government expenditure should be based on evidence-based study, and there must be accountability. Utilizing the recommendations in this report, OSPD and the Public Defender Task Force will be able to provide the Legislature with a plan to correct the deficiencies in the current splintered system while retaining those aspects that are working well," de Gruy said.</p>

<p>Correction: A previous version of this story reported that Gov. Phil Bryant had signed House Bill 387. He has not signed the measure yet. We apologize for the error. </p>

<h2 id="analysisfostercareagencyseeksmoneytomeetmandates">Analysis: Foster Care Agency Seeks Money to Meet Mandates</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-19</p>

<p>Former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Jess Dickinson (center), pictured here with his wife Janet (left) and Justice Jim Kitchens (right), became the commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services in September 2017.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi legislators are approaching the final phase of patching holes in the current year's state budget and writing a $6 billion spending plan for fiscal 2019, which begins July 1.</p>

<p>Budget writers face deadlines in late March, and the Department of Child Protection Services is among the agencies requesting more money for this year and next.</p>

<p>The agency is trying to fulfill a federal court order to improve Mississippi's long-troubled foster care system, and Jess Dickinson inherited financial problems when he became director in mid-September. Like his predecessor, David Chandler, Dickinson served as a Mississippi Supreme Court justice before Gov. Phil Bryant moved him over to lead the child welfare agency.</p>

<p>Dickinson told The Associated Press last week that he's not assigning blame for the budget deficit that existed when he started the job.</p>

<p>Child Protection Services is part of the larger Department of Human Services, but under a law enacted in 2016, it has been working toward becoming a stand-alone agency by this July.</p>

<p>Human Services has subsidized the Child Protection Services' budget by using state money to bring in federal money - a "matching" program that's available to Human Services but could not be used by Child Protection Services as a stand-alone agency.</p>

<p>Dickinson told lawmakers months ago that Child Protection Services was facing a $50 million shortfall for the current year. The agency saved money by cutting some contracts. And Human Services was again able to use federal matching money to help out. Those changes reduced the current year's shortfall to $12 million, and Dickinson is asking legislators to provide that money.</p>

<p>The Joint Legislative Budget Committee recommends that the state spend just under $98 million on Child Protection Services in fiscal 2019. That's the same amount originally budgeted for the current year. However, Dickinson said to meet federal court requirements, the agency needs $133 million for the coming year.</p>

<p>It could be a difficult request to fulfill because money is tight.</p>

<p>Mississippi had 5,538 children in foster care Thursday, with 1,457 of them — about 26 percent — coming from the coastal counties of Harrison, Jackson and Hancock. Dickinson said drug traffic along the Gulf Coast likely accounts for some child abuse. He said abuse cases also increased after the 2010 oil spill, when people lost jobs.</p>

<p>A 2004 federal lawsuit filed against Mississippi said children had suffered abuse because of shoddy work in the foster care system. Republican Bryant has often said since becoming governor in 2012 that improving foster care is one of his main goals.</p>

<p>Marcia Lowry is an attorney and executive director of A Better Childhood, a group based in Chappaqua, New York, that is among those suing the state. She said in a March 5 letter to state attorneys that she intends to ask a judge to find the state is out of compliance with a court order.</p>

<p>The court order required Child Protection Services to have at least 50 percent of its workers in compliance with a certain level of caseloads by Sept. 30. Dickinson said the agency met that level. But the requirement increased to 90 percent of workers being in compliance by Dec. 31, and he acknowledged that the agency does not meet the higher level.</p>

<p>"Given our current funding level, we have kind of reached a plateau. This is, really and truly, absent some appropriate funding for this agency, we are doing about the best we can do," Dickinson said Thursday. "I don't have enough case workers. I don't have enough supervisors. I don't have enough resources to do it, given the money."</p>

<p>JACKSON — Terry Beasley remembers a white guy locked in his cell in East Mississippi Correctional Facility one night in 2017, dying. "He was blue," Beasley, an inmate serving a life sentence for a homicide-murder conviction, said in U.S. District Judge William Barbour's courtroom on Friday, March 9.</p>

<p>Some inmates started banging on their windows to try to get the officers' attention, but it took more than an hour for officers to come down to the man's cell from what he could tell from his own cell that night, Beasley said. Eventually, medical staff and the captain came into the zone and recovered the man's body.</p>

<p>"It made me feel scared because I'm a diabetic, and you never know when your sugar (could) drop," said Beasley, who is also asthmatic and diabetic.</p>

<p>Beasley used to clean out cells at the prison in Lauderdale County. On the stand, he described life "in the zone" at one of Mississippi's three private prisons in federal court. He testified that he misses his morning insulin treatment "a lot" whenever the officer in the tower does not let him out of his cell to go get the medication.</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Prison Project of the ACLU and two other law firms brought a class-action lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections back in 2013 due to conditions at EMCF. After the department refused to settle twice, the case went to trial this month in what is expected to be at least a month-long ordeal.</p>

<p>Operated by the Utah-based Management and Training Corporation since 2012, EMCF is one of three private prisons in the state that MTC operates. MDOC is responsible for the facility and stations a monitor there to track how the facility operates. More than 80 percent of the inmates there are on some type of mental-health medication or treatment protocol.</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that conditions at the prison violate the Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners housed there. Attorneys must prove in court that inmates receive "cruel and unusual punishment" as a result of being housed there.</p>

<p>The State of Mississippi hired two private law firms to defend MDOC in the case. Their position is that the department is not "deliberately indifferent" to the treatment of inmates at the prison. In his opening statement, W. Thomas Siler Jr. encouraged Judge Barbour to go see the facility for himself. He said EMCF has made great strides and changed a lot since MTC took over the facility in 2012.</p>

<p>"We disagree with their conclusion that we're not adequately staffed," Siler said, noting that many of the issues with the facility and with contraband are "issues caused by sabotage by inmates."</p>

<p>Attorneys defending the state asked the judge to take anecdotal evidence with a grain of salt, emphasizing that the focus of the case needs to be on whether or not the state has violated the Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners.</p>

<p>"Are any of the issues they're complaining about current and ongoing?" Siler said.</p>

<p>Missing Basics</p>

<p>Warden Frank Shaw, who runs the prison, is sitting in on the trial, and the State plans to call him as a witness and use him to represent one of the named defendants in the case. The lawsuit names Department of Corrections Commissioner Pelicia Hall as well as Gloria Perry, the chief medical officer at MDOC, and Archie Longley, the deputy commissioner of institutions. Shaw is a Management and Training Corporation employee, however. The private company is not a party to the lawsuit, however.</p>

<p>"The state is responsible for whether it's run properly, and that's what at issue," Judge Barbour told the court last week.</p>

<p>Inmates wore black-and-white striped bottoms, chains around their waists jangling and white tops with the words "MDOC INMATE" across the back. They sat right across the room from the State's attorneys and Shaw. Attorneys representing the prisoners plan to have at least two inmates in the courtroom every day throughout the trial. They will call some of the prisoners as witnesses as the trial unfolds.</p>

<p>In the first week, the plaintiffs called nine witnesses, beginning with Eldon Vail, a 35-year veteran corrections officer and operator from Washington state. Vail visited the prison once in 2014 and again in 2016 to evaluate the state of the prison, including safety, security and staffing levels.</p>

<p>"I concluded that it's a very dangerous facility," Vail testified last week, saying that the "basics" were missing.</p>

<p>"There are not a sufficient number of correctional officers, and most of their problems stem from that issue."</p>

<p>Vail reviewed thousands of documents and conducted interviews the plaintiffs' attorneys arranged. He could not interview prison staff, however. MDOC keeps a monitor at the Meridian private prison to report progress and inadequacies at the facility. The weekly and monthly monitor reports confirmed and reinforced his initial conclusion about the facility, he testified.</p>

<p>"You see the same kinds of issues occurring over and over again," he said.</p>

<p>'Logic Is Not Logic'</p>

<p>Staffing concerns and who is responsible for what happens inside prison walls came up repeatedly in testimony. The inmates who worked as porters in 2015 and 2016 cleaning cells testified to seeing fires daily and cleaning up blood after inmates stuck their hands out of their cells' food slots or from cutting themselves.</p>

<p>The facility, like most prisons in the state, has a contraband problem. In March 2017, visiting privileges at the prison were suspended after back-to-back contraband shakedowns revealed that inmates were posting on the Internet, presumably from contraband cell phones.</p>

<p>"MDOC officials searched a specific section of the facility after learning of an inmate posting live on Facebook last weekend," a March 7, 2017, press release from MDOC says.</p>

<p>Attorneys representing the State said that a lot of incidents—from fires to contraband cell phones to self-harm incidents—are the inmates' fault. How far responsibility stretches to the State—and MTC's employees by extension—to keep the facility in order is at the heart of the case.</p>

<p>Eddie Pugh, an inmate who sat in court all last week and testified Friday, described an incident late last year when a new inmate came to his housing unit. Correctional officers expected inmates to choose where the new inmate would live, Pugh said, and when inmates refused to find him a place, they were put on lockdown.</p>

<p>"We were in the dark for three weeks; we were forced into the cells at gunpoint," Pugh said in court last Friday.</p>

<p>Pugh told the court about how some inmates force others out of their cells and have to sleep on the floor of other cells.</p>

<p>"Do the gangs make that decision?" Judge Barbour asked him.</p>

<p>"To truly understand EMCF, you'd have to be there more than one time...," Pugh responded.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't every man have his own bed?" Barbour asked.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," Pugh said. "... Logic is not logic in this place."</p>

<p>The trial continues this week, as attorneys representing inmates have about two-and-a-half more weeks of testimony to offer. Defendants will not take nearly as long, Siler told the court.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Lately Tetrina Blalock has been reconnecting with family members she has not seen in a while. Losing her cousin brought them together. Jackson Police Department officers shot Lee Edward Bonner on Feb. 21, and he died from his injuries two days later at the age of 37, not long before his first grandchild would be born.</p>

<p>Blalock thinks police shot her cousin between eight and 17 times, but she cannot know for sure because of what she calls JPD's "big cloak of secrecy."</p>

<p>JPD has not released the names of the two officers involved in the Bonner shooting, or any of the others involved in at least six other officer-involved shootings since July 2017. Blalock found out with the rest of the people in Jackson City Council chambers at the Feb. 27 meeting that the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations had stepped in to oversee her cousin's case.</p>

<p>Blalock says she is still getting the runaround as far as case numbers, an update of the investigation or a contact person. She has not received any condolences either, she said.</p>

<p>It does not sit well with Blalock that before JPD even released Bonner's name, it had told the public he had allegedly fired his handgun at officers and was a convicted felon. In the officer-involved shooting in January that killed Crystalline Barnes, 21, in her car, JPD sent out an apparent mugshot with the details of the incident. Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba halted this practice with an executive order on Feb. 26.</p>

<p>"I knew Ms. Barnes in passing," Blalock told the Jackson Free Press. "I never thought that after what happened to her, it would turn around and happen to a relative of mine. ... You never think it's going to be that personal."</p>

<p>Blalock recalled a time when she and Bonner were younger, when he protected her from bullies—back when she had more trust in police. Now raising a 14-year-old boy, she tells him to keep his hands on the steering wheel at "10 and two" during a traffic stop to avoid getting shot.</p>

<p>"It shouldn't be that every time you see a police officer, your heart skips a beat, or you hold your breath because you don't know what's going to happen," Blalock told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Blalock does not hate police, and she has not lost hope in Jackson, but she does want change, transparency about JPD's use-of-force policy and the specifics of her cousin's case. Moreover, Blalock does not want another family to go through the same ordeal, and she promises not to rest until she gets clarity and justice.</p>

<p>"To not have answers hurts even more," Blalock said.</p>

<p>Protocols Revealed</p>

<p>Jackson's use-of-force policy dates back to 2004 establishes guidelines and protocol for both deadly and non-deadly responses to arrest or control someone.</p>

<p>The policy, which a city council member provided to the Jackson Free Press, instructs officers to demonstrate "sensitivity, sound judgment, and knowledge of the law," and to only use the amount of force necessary to apprehend someone.</p>

<p>In making a misdemeanor arrest, police are not supposed to employ deadly force, nor is it to be used for anyone unarmed, not resisting or "merely fleeing" from the officer. In a felony arrest, officers may use deadly force if they believe it will save their own lives or that of citizens, or if the suspect is a fleeing felon presenting an "imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm," the policy says.</p>

<p>"'I was in fear for my life ...,'" Blalock said of a common response officers say after shooting civilians. "It's like those seven words magically put a shield around you," Blalock said in the interview.</p>

<p>Police in Jackson are barred from shooting into crowds, firing from a moving vehicle and shooting toward a driver—except if an officer or "innocent citizens'" are in danger. They may not shoot at tires, either. In January, Jackson police officers fired into Barnes' car after saying she drove toward two officers at the scene.</p>

<p>Officers who shoot civilians attend stress counseling and a psychiatric/psychological evaluation, the results of which are sent to the police chief before he allows an officer to return to the line of duty. Interim Chief of Police Anthony Moore tweaked this policy. At a city council meeting on Feb. 27, the chief said officers now will not return until after a grand jury reaches a decision—a process that could take at least a year.</p>

<p>"They want the sensationalization of it to die down," Blalock said in response. "Once your nerves are no longer raw...."</p>

<p>The officer also has to debrief with JPD's Employee Assistance Program counselor within 48 hours of the incident so that he or she can confidentially disclose any moral, ethical or psychological after-effects.</p>

<p>During administrative leave after a shooting of a civilian, JPD's policy directs the officer involved to keep quiet about the incident unless discussing it with his or her attorney, investigators handling the case, "chosen clergy," immediate family members or his or her psychologist.</p>

<p>The officer also has to be available to give department interviews and statements regarding the shooting.</p>

<p>JPD has the wide authority to perform "any other action deemed appropriate" to protect officers, the department or the City, as the use-of-force order reads.</p>

<p>In this case, their actions have involved a code of silence, although the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015 recommended that departments release names of officers quickly to keep the public trust.</p>

<p>Phillip Atiba Goff, co-founder and president of the Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, told the Jackson Free Press that there is no consistent national standard for the protocol on releasing names. However, he also said that releasing video and information can build trust in communities as opposed to a policy of blocking information. Moore has said JPD does not have body cams or the funding for them. </p>

<p>The yin to that yang, as Goff put it, is that police departments also have a duty to protect their officers' identities especially since the nation has seen a spike in targeted, deadly ambushes of law enforcement.</p>

<p>"Finding a balance between officer privacy and officer protections after such a tragic and touchstone incident, and community trust is a difficult one, but those are at least the issues that departments should be balancing," Goff said.</p>

<p>Police Reform Stalling?</p>

<p>There is not an "off-the-shelf" prescription for the best use-of-force policy, Goff said, but he is sure that public outcry after such incidents can help communities achieve the right balance, even as national attention has shifted away. Goff is concerned about policing reform stalling out.</p>

<p>"America is supposed to be an engine for innovation; let's be an engine for innovation in the area of justice," he added. "And that can't happen without a sustained conversation."</p>

<p>Here in Jackson, Blalock is concerned, too, and hopes people see the larger picture. That is why voting matters to her. Jacksonians put Mayor Lumumba in office, who appointed Chief Moore—"the one who doesn't say anything," she said.</p>

<p>"I know the mayor said he's a man of few words, but no, he's mute," Blalock added about the chief.</p>

<p>Blalock does not want others to live with a slain family member constantly in the back of their minds like she does, or the paranoia of what could happen in a routine interaction with an officer. Not long before ending the phone interview with the JFP, Blalock looked in her rearview mirror.</p>

<p>"It's a police officer behind me right now, which is so interesting," she said.</p>

<h2 id="editorsnoterightleftmustworktogetherforcriminalreforms">EDITOR'S NOTE: Right, Left Must Work Together for Criminal Reforms</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-14</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/14/editors-note-right-left-must-work-together-crimina/ </p>

<p>Former felon and criminal attorney John Koufos attracted enough attention while at the New Jersey Reentry Corporation—growing it from one site to nine—that he was hired to bring his "dignity of work" mantra to the Right on Crime effort, where he is now the national director of reentry initiatives.

<p>Donna Ladd</p>

<p>You can spot the New Jersey in John Koufos as soon as he walks up, stares you frenetically in the eye and starts talking about the need for prison reform and re-entry. You can also tell he was pretty slick as a criminal defense attorney back in New Brunswick, N.J., when he defended violent criminals and gang members on murder and racketeering charges. He also did a lot of pro bono cases for poor people of color, but that's not what would gain him notoriety.</p>

<p>In the basement of the Old Capitol Inn on March 5, in an event paid for by the Mississippi branch of Americans for Prosperity—a rather infamous conservative group funded by the also-infamous Koch brothers—Koufos told his prison story, sounding like a stereotypical scumbag attorney like those who defended Barksdale in "The Wire."</p>

<p>Koufos, then 34, was arguing with his girlfriend by text in 2011 while driving his black Lexus from a bar association meeting at a restaurant when he struck Kevin O'Brien, who was walking on the shoulder of the road after getting ice cream, and then fled. O'Brien was seriously injured with head trauma and a ruptured spleen. He was in a coma, but has permanent damage.</p>

<p>Craig Terlizzi, Koufos' 40-year-old assistant, at first took the blame for the accident and was charged in the hit-and-run.</p>

<p>Koufos said in Jackson that he was drunk. In fact, he was drunk much of the time then. And he drove drunk constantly. His mother was 16 when she got pregnent with him in Connecticut, and she was a drug addict.</p>

<p>His father wasn't the best role model, either. He was a bounty hunter and kidnapped someone's girlfriend. He ran to avoid arrest, taking his son with him, moving from state to state until he was caught and went to federal prison.</p>

<p>After pleading guilty, Koufos was sentenced for six years in state prison and was paroled after 17 months under the condition that he would go into rehab (an option many prisoners do not enjoy).</p>

<p>In prison, Koufos says, he was one of the few white faces in his block. He says he learned what most of them needed the most. "Nobody asked me for money, but almost everybody asked me for a job," he told the mostly white, male, conservative audience, including several state legislators.</p>

<p>When Koufos left prison, he was disbarred and decided to back reforms that could help men he met on the inside. "If we can fix the problems, we save tomorrow's victims," he said in Jackson. That means, of course, not just the people who commit the crimes, but those they hurt along the way.</p>

<p>In 2015, Koufos became the executive director of the New Jersey Reentry Corporation, supported by then-Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican.</p>

<p>The idea was to help former prisoners re-enter society ready to work and with services they need, and to connect them with good-paying jobs. What too often happens, especially in a tough-on-crime state like Mississippi, where prisons are packed and re-entry help is limited, is that former prisoners cannot support themselves or their families on the outside. People won't hire them, or they're not ready to keep a job, or there just aren't any they are qualified to hold. Then they can end up re-offending and return to prison, leaving families behind again and continuing the cycle.</p>

<p>They also cost the government money when they're behind bars - which is partly or mostly why re-entry and prison reform have become high priority for conservative groups like those the Koch brothers fund.</p>

<p>Koufos attracted enough attention while at NJRC—growing it from one site to nine—that the Koch crowd hired him to bring his "dignity of work" mantra to its Right on Crime effort, where he is now the national director of reentry initiatives. He was in Jackson, in part, to back House Bill 387 that is still alive at the Mississippi Legislature, essentially the same re-entry reform legislation Gov. Bryant vetoed last year. If passed, the law would ensure that Mississippians are not locked up automatically for their inability to pay court fines and fees; allow inmates convicted of certain crimes to be parole eligible after serving 25 percent of their sentence; and create the Mississippi Sentencing Disparity Task Force.</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of the Koch universe, and I believe much of what they support and fund may cause problems Koufos is trying to convince Mississippi to solve, down to the lack of support for fully funding public schools rather than trying to funnel taxpayer money to select ones. That said, I agreed with about 90 percent of what I heard at the Old Capitol that night—if not that one audience member who didn't think folks should be locked up for white-collar crime. Koufos pointed out, though, that stealing pensions is worse than a young black person stealing $10 at a convenience store.</p>

<p>If you're not aware, there is a very strong conservative movement to reform criminal justice, and it is actually more conservative than many of the tough-on-crime policies politicians push to get elected, which then backfire, cost money and cause more crime. They're shortsighted.</p>

<p>We can, and likely will, argue over the specifics, but this kind of policy shift is needed, and these efforts must be bi-partisan. I get sick of divisive politics that seem more about "wins" than getting important policy changes and programs in place.</p>

<p>A likely Democratic candidate for Sen. Thad Cochran's seat called me this week to chat about what he believed in. I noticed that he didn't mention criminal-justice reform, although he does want the "millennial vote," and I asked him about it. He didn't seem opposed to the idea, but I could sense he hadn't thought about it much.</p>

<p>It is time that criminal-justice reform be on every candidate's agenda in Mississippi, regardless of party. The goal should be to lower mass incarceration, especially for drug and victimless crimes—which both parties here voted to begin back in 2014. The dumb tough-on-crime rhetoric must stop. And I sure hate to think that conservatives are finding the courage to have this dialogue in Mississippi more often than those who claim to be progressive.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Legislature should pass HB 387. The bill is a good step toward solving the serious reality that most of the people sent to Mississippi prisons will get out some day and very possibly end up committing worse crime, returning them to institutions funded by the taxpayers' dime.</p>

<p>Oh, and criminal-justice reform is the right thing to do for fallible human beings, whether you're a slick defense attorney from New Jersey or a man who grew up making bad decisions in south Jackson.</p>

<p>Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, asked the Mississippi House to send the re-entry bill to the governor's desk, which it did on Wednesday, March 14. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — If Gov. Phil Bryant signs House Bill 387 into law, Mississippians will not automatically go to prison or jail if they do not pay fines or court fees. The legislation designates a defendant at or below 125 percent of the federal poverty guidelines as poor in the legislation, and judges must take that into consideration when assessing fines and fees.</p>

<p>A judge "shall make an individualized assessment of his or her ability to pay based on the totality of the circumstances including, but not limited to, the defendant's disposable income, financial obligations and liquid assets," the bill says.</p>

<p>Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, took the measure up on Wednesday and asked the House of Representatives to concur with the Senate's changes. The House voted to send the measure to the governor's desk. HB 387 also allows inmates who are not habitual offenders or convicted of sex or violent crimes, or drug trafficking to be eligible for parole after serving 25 percent of their sentence.</p>

<p>A group of clergy came to the capitol last week to vocalize their support for the measure, as well as John Koufos, a former felon who is now the national director of reentry initiatives for the Right on Crime organization, a conservative group supported by the Koch family.</p>

<p>"We must continue to reduce our reliance on incarceration," Rev. C.J. Rhodes said in a press release.</p>

<p>The legislation contains elements that show that legislators intend to continue studying how the State can evaluate and monitor its justice system. HB 387 directs the Joint Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review to conduct a detailed census of juvenile detention centers, county and municipal jails, including offenders' race, gender, offenses and length of sentence. The bill also creates the Mississippi Sentencing Disparity Task Force to look at the disparities in how judges sentence individuals for certain crimes throughout the state.</p>

<p>The measure does give judges an option to deviate from giving a person considered a "habitual offender" the maximum sentence for their third felony, as state law mandates now. A habitual offender " is someone convicted of two felonies previously. Judges can provide an explanation under the proposal to deviate from mandating a maximum sentence.</p>

<p>Gov. Bryant vetoed this measure last year after objecting to some language that could have made certain habitual offenders parole-eligible after serving 25 percent of their sentence. Lawmakers removed that language from the bill this session.</p>

<h2 id="groupswantjudgestostopcourthouseimmigrationarrests">Groups Want Judges to Stop Courthouse Immigration Arrests</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-15</p>

<p>BOSTON (AP) — Civil rights and indigent defense groups asked Massachusetts' highest court Thursday to stop federal agents from arresting immigrants targeted for deportation at courthouses, saying the practice is scaring victims, witnesses and others away from halls of justice.</p>

<p>The petition filed in the Supreme Judicial Court cites immigrants — including a woman who wants to renew a restraining order against her abusive ex-husband — who are too afraid to enter state and local courthouses out of fear of deportation.</p>

<p>The challenge, believed to be the first of its kind in the country, comes as advocates, attorneys and judges have complained about courtroom arrests under President Donald Trump. Courtroom arrests happened under President Barack Obama's administration but attorneys have said the pace appears to have picked up under Trump.</p>

<p>"When people fear our judicial system, that undermines the very fabric of our society and weakens communities," said Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, one of the groups that filed the petition on the immigrants' behalf.</p>

<p>Despite pressure from advocates to declare courthouses "sensitive locations" generally free from immigration enforcement, federal officials in January formalized a policy to send agents to federal, state and local courthouses to make arrests.</p>

<p>Sensitive locations where enforcement is generally avoided include schools, hospitals and places of worship.</p>

<p>ICE says it is targeting convicted criminals, gang members and public safety threats at courthouses as well as immigrants who have been previously deported or ordered to leave. Officials say family, friends and witnesses in court won't be arrested— absent "special circumstances." ICE says it will "generally avoid" immigration enforcement in non-criminal courthouses, like family court.</p>

<p>Trump administration officials have also said that courthouses are a safer place for agents to make arrests since visitors typically have to go through metal detectors.</p>

<p>ICE Spokesman John Mohan said Thursday that the agency does not comment on pending litigation as a matter of policy.</p>

<p>But Mohan said ICE's enforcement action in courthouses is "wholly consistent with longstanding law enforcement practices nationwide." He said jurisdictions' unwillingness to transfer immigrants in local prisons and jails to ICE custody often necessitates courthouse arrests.</p>

<p>Last month, more than 100 New York City public defenders walked out in protest of their clients getting detained by immigration officials, with one lawyer saying ICE agents are "trolling" the courthouse.</p>

<p>And the chief justice of the California Supreme Court last year complained in a letter to top federal officials that ICE agents were "stalking" courthouses to make arrests.</p>

<p>The petition asks the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to issue a "writ of protection" that would block ICE from arresting people in courthouses for civil immigration violations. The attorneys point to a common law doctrine that protects people who have business before a court from arrest on civil matters.</p>

<p>"It is based on a simple longstanding principle: If people fear arrest on unrelated civil matters, they will be hesitant to go to court, and that will severely undermine the functioning of our judicial system," Wendy Wayne of the Committee for Public Counsel Services, Massachusetts' public defender agency, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Espinoza-Madrigal said the challenge to the courthouse arrests is the first of its kind and will likely spur similar legal actions in other states.</p>

<p>Pratheepan Gulasekaram, an immigration law expert at Santa Clara University, said critics could also argue that the federal government is obstructing justice by scaring witnesses and others away from court.</p>

<p>"It's not clear how these legal theories will play out because many of them present novel issues that courts have yet to wrestle with," he said.</p>

<p>The immigrants cited in the petition include a man from Honduras who was violently attacked and is afraid to appear in court as a witness because he believes his attacker may tell ICE he's living in the U.S. illegally. Another woman from Guatemala wants to go to court to try to force her son's father to pay child support.</p>

<p>A woman from Brazil cited in the suit wants to renew a restraining order against her ex-husband who she said threatened to kill her, but said she is terrified about what would happen to her son if she is deported.</p>

<p>The immigrants are not named in the petition.</p>

<h2 id="blackmalearrestedmadisoncountycasemaygoclassaction">Black, Male, Arrested: Madison County Case May Go Class Action</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-16</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/16/black-male-arrested-madison-county-case-may-go-cla/ </p>

<p>Quinnetta Manning (left) and Steven Smith (right), pictured here in May 2017, are two of the 10 Madison County residents suing the county and sheriff's department for discriminatory policing. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Ten black residents in Madison County are suing the county and sheriff's department, which stopped, searched or arrested them. They allege that the county's policing strategies disproportionately target them and not white residents—with officers even pre-checking 'black,' 'male,' and 'arrested' on paperwork before knowing who they would apprehend. They also allege that deputies used the word "n-gger" during arrests.</p>

<p>Now, after a half-year of discovery in the case, the ACLU of Mississippi is asking the federal court to certify it as a class-action complaint, meaning their lawsuit would be on behalf of all black residents in Madison County, not just the named plaintiffs.</p>

<p>Attorneys argue that Madison County's policing program violates black residents' rights outlined in the Fourth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The ACLU of Mississippi released data found during discovery at a press conference Wednesday.</p>

<p>Black residents only make up 38 percent of Madison County's population, but 77 percent the Madison County Sheriff's Department made between 2012 and 2017 were black individuals, ACLU data show.</p>

<p>The ACLU of Mississippi brought the lawsuit in May 2017 after a year-long investigation of policing strategies. Public records show that the Madison County sheriff's department targets black communities, the ACLU argues.</p>

<p>"Almost 81 percent of roadblock arrests in Madison County between May and September of 2016 were of black individuals," the complaint, filed last year, says.</p>

<p>The county denies most of the allegations in the complaint, and in its answer outlined Sheriff Randall Tucker's involvement in the community and schools with the goal of improving race relations.</p>

<p>"Upon entry to office, Sheriff Tucker also created a Madison County Community Advisory Group comprised of citizens, business owners, homeowners and others, both Black and White, to meet together and to discuss any and all concerns all citizens have in regard to the activities of the Madison County Sheriff's Department," the defendant's answer filed June 29, 2017, says. "One of the purposes for his creating this Group was to improve race relations in Madison County, which has been one of his main objectives since being elected to office."</p>

<p>Attorneys representing black residents in the county disagree.</p>

<p>"MCSD's own paperwork confirms that it targets Black citizens for arrest," said Joshua Tom, legal director for the ACLU of Mississippi, in a press release. "In the course of our class certification discovery, MCSD officials produced template forms that deputies use in the course of their duties, and on those forms from at least two officers appear pre-populated checkboxes marking 'black,' 'male,' and 'arrested.' The evidence will show discriminatory and unconstitutional policing, and we are looking forward to presenting all of the facts as our case moves forward."</p>

<p>Data from the ACLU of Mississippi show that 76 percent of roadblock arrests in Madison County are black residents. The Madison County Sheriff's Department denied that their roadblocks target certain communities or residents, "Black or White," their answer filed last year says.</p>

<p>"The roadblocks conducted by the Sheriff's Department over the last three years show that they were evenly disbursed throughout Madison County. Further, according to Sheriff's Department policies, each vehicle was stopped and certain information was uniformly obtained during these roadblocks," the defendant's answer says.</p>

<p>"... Any differences in the number of Black individuals and White individuals arrested during these roadblocks is irrelevant to the location of these roadblocks. Instead, these arrests were based on each individual arrested and whether probable cause existed for their arrest or whether a warrant was outstanding for their arrest."</p>

<p>Two plaintiffs in the ACLU's case testified about their experiences of roadblocks in the motion for class certification.</p>

<p>"Plaintiff Bessie Thomas testified that when she tried to speak to an MCSD deputy during a roadblock the deputy cut her off and, referring to the cars behind her, said, 'I've got all these n-ggers off the side of this road,'" the motion says. "Class member Quincy Smith stated that at a traffic stop, he witnessed a white MCSD deputy tell a Black MCSD deputy that he wasn't 'going to help a n-gger out' by letting a driver go without a ticket." (Note: The JFP adds hyphens to certain offensive words out of respect for our readers.)</p>

<p>The plaintiffs have also requested oral argument in the case.</p>

<h2 id="sabotagedeathdangerprivateprisonontrial-1">Sabotage, Death, Danger: Private Prison on Trial</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>Prisoners in the East Mississippi Correctional Facility (pictured) started testifying against the Mississippi Department of Corrections last week. Photo courtesy Mississippi Department of Corrections</p>

<p>JACKSON — Terry Beasley remembers a white guy locked in his cell in East Mississippi Correctional Facility one night in 2017, dying. "He was blue," Beasley, an inmate serving a life sentence for a homicide-murder conviction, said in U.S. District Judge William Barbour's courtroom on Friday, March 9.</p>

<p>Some inmates started banging on their windows to try to get the officers' attention, but it took more than an hour for officers to come down to the man's cell from what he could tell from his own cell that night, Beasley said. Eventually, medical staff and the captain came into the zone and recovered the man's body.</p>

<p>"It made me feel scared because I'm a diabetic, and you never know when your sugar (could) drop," said Beasley, who is also asthmatic and diabetic.</p>

<p>Beasley used to clean out cells at the prison in Lauderdale County. On the stand, he described life "in the zone" at one of Mississippi's three private prisons in federal court. He testified that he misses his morning insulin treatment "a lot" whenever the officer in the tower does not let him out of his cell to go get the medication.</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Prison Project of the ACLU and two other law firms brought a class-action lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections back in 2013 due to conditions at EMCF. After the department refused to settle twice, the case went to trial this month in what is expected to be at least a month-long ordeal.</p>

<p>Operated by the Utah-based Management and Training Corporation since 2012, EMCF is one of three private prisons in the state that MTC operates. MDOC is responsible for the facility and stations a monitor there to track how the facility operates. More than 80 percent of the inmates there are on some type of mental-health medication or treatment protocol.</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that conditions at the prison violate the Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners housed there. Attorneys must prove in court that inmates receive "cruel and unusual punishment" as a result of being housed there.</p>

<p>The State of Mississippi hired two private law firms to defend MDOC in the case. Their position is that the department is not "deliberately indifferent" to the treatment of inmates at the prison. In his opening statement, W. Thomas Siler Jr. encouraged Judge Barbour to go see the facility for himself. He said EMCF has made great strides and changed a lot since MTC took over the facility in 2012.</p>

<p>"We disagree with their conclusion that we're not adequately staffed," Siler said, noting that many of the issues with the facility and with contraband are "issues caused by sabotage by inmates."</p>

<p>Attorneys defending the state asked the judge to take anecdotal evidence with a grain of salt, emphasizing that the focus of the case needs to be on whether or not the state has violated the Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners.</p>

<p>"Are any of the issues they're complaining about current and ongoing?" Siler said.</p>

<p>Missing Basics</p>

<p>Warden Frank Shaw, who runs the prison, is sitting in on the trial, and the State plans to call him as a witness and use him to represent one of the named defendants in the case. The lawsuit names Department of Corrections Commissioner Pelicia Hall as well as Gloria Perry, the chief medical officer at MDOC, and Archie Longley, the deputy commissioner of institutions. Shaw is a Management and Training Corporation employee, however. The private company is not a party to the lawsuit, however.</p>

<p>"The state is responsible for whether it's run properly, and that's what at issue," Judge Barbour told the court last week.</p>

<p>Inmates wore black-and-white striped bottoms, chains around their waists jangling and white tops with the words "MDOC INMATE" across the back. They sat right across the room from the State's attorneys and Shaw. Attorneys representing the prisoners plan to have at least two inmates in the courtroom every day throughout the trial. They will call some of the prisoners as witnesses as the trial unfolds.</p>

<p>In the first week, the plaintiffs called nine witnesses, beginning with Eldon Vail, a 35-year veteran corrections officer and operator from Washington state. Vail visited the prison once in 2014 and again in 2016 to evaluate the state of the prison, including safety, security and staffing levels.</p>

<p>"I concluded that it's a very dangerous facility," Vail testified last week, saying that the "basics" were missing.</p>

<p>"There are not a sufficient number of correctional officers, and most of their problems stem from that issue."</p>

<p>Vail reviewed thousands of documents and conducted interviews the plaintiffs' attorneys arranged. He could not interview prison staff, however. MDOC keeps a monitor at the Meridian private prison to report progress and inadequacies at the facility. The weekly and monthly monitor reports confirmed and reinforced his initial conclusion about the facility, he testified.</p>

<p>"You see the same kinds of issues occurring over and over again," he said.</p>

<p>'Logic Is Not Logic'</p>

<p>Staffing concerns and who is responsible for what happens inside prison walls came up repeatedly in testimony. The inmates who worked as porters in 2015 and 2016 cleaning cells testified to seeing fires daily and cleaning up blood after inmates stuck their hands out of their cells' food slots or from cutting themselves.</p>

<p>The facility, like most prisons in the state, has a contraband problem. In March 2017, visiting privileges at the prison were suspended after back-to-back contraband shakedowns revealed that inmates were posting on the Internet, presumably from contraband cell phones.</p>

<p>"MDOC officials searched a specific section of the facility after learning of an inmate posting live on Facebook last weekend," a March 7, 2017, press release from MDOC says.</p>

<p>Attorneys representing the State said that a lot of incidents—from fires to contraband cell phones to self-harm incidents—are the inmates' fault. How far responsibility stretches to the State—and MTC's employees by extension—to keep the facility in order is at the heart of the case.</p>

<p>Eddie Pugh, an inmate who sat in court all last week and testified Friday, described an incident late last year when a new inmate came to his housing unit. Correctional officers expected inmates to choose where the new inmate would live, Pugh said, and when inmates refused to find him a place, they were put on lockdown.</p>

<p>"We were in the dark for three weeks; we were forced into the cells at gunpoint," Pugh said in court last Friday.</p>

<p>Pugh told the court about how some inmates force others out of their cells and have to sleep on the floor of other cells.</p>

<p>"Do the gangs make that decision?" Judge Barbour asked him.</p>

<p>"To truly understand EMCF, you'd have to be there more than one time...," Pugh responded.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't every man have his own bed?" Barbour asked.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," Pugh said. "... Logic is not logic in this place."</p>

<p>The trial continues this week, as attorneys representing inmates have about two-and-a-half more weeks of testimony to offer. Defendants will not take nearly as long, Siler told the court.</p>

<p>Fair Commission Breaks Ground on New Mississippi Trade Mart</p>

<p>The Mississippi Fair Commission held a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Mississippi Trade Mart on Thursday, March 8. The state Legislature authorized $30 million to build the new Trade Mart and to make improvements to the Mississippi Fairgrounds.</p>

<p>Jackson architectural firm Wier Boerner Allin Architecture designed the new Trade Mart building, and Jackson-based Fountain Construction is the general contractor.</p>

<p>Cindy Hyde-Smith, the state commissioner of agriculture and commerce, announced the building project in November 2017. The new 105,000-square-foot facility will be attached to the east side of the Mississippi Coliseum and replace the current Trade Mart, which was constructed in 1975.</p>

<p>Hyde-Smith said in January 2017 that the building was outmoded, had a flat roof that leaked and would need to be demolished. The current Mississippi Trade Mart will remain in operation until the new facility is completed in late 2019 to early 2020.</p>

<h2 id="notsoftoncrimeclergywantprisonreformstobecomelaw">Not 'Soft on Crime': Clergy Want Prison Reforms to Become Law</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/12/not-soft-crime-clergy-want-prison-reforms-become-l/ </p>

<p>Pastors and advocates gathered at the Mississippi Capitol last week to express support for criminal-justice reform bills still alive this session. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Mississippi Legislature could approve two re-entry and criminal-justice reform measures this session, which are still alive. House Bill 387 and Senate Bill 2841 would change several parts of state law to help inmates coming out of prison get on their feet financially and avoid going back to prison or jail immediately for not being able to pay fines and fees, among other changes.</p>

<p>Last week, several pastors and faith leaders from around the state and the Jackson metro area gathered at the Capitol to express support for both bills.</p>

<p>"We all need some form of restoration and rehabilitation, so I want to be an advocate for the incarcerated to see them not re-enter, not to go back, but to get what they need: programming while they're incarcerated and also rehabilitation, counseling, health care," Matt McGue, lead pastor of One Church, said.</p>

<p>"So sometimes people can take this advocacy piece as soft on crime, and it's not. We're saying let's be fair to the human dignity of all people, whether they are serving time or not."</p>

<p>Rev. CJ Rhodes, who leads Clergy for Prison Reform, counts almost 12 bills, including the gang bill that died after a House committee did not meet. Rhodes was glad to see the gang bill go down. He said his group is really watching House Bill 387, hoping it will pass.</p>

<p>"Our major push has been more humane treatment when you go into the system, but on the front end, finding less reasons for people to be put in those positions in the first place," Rhodes said at the Capitol last week. He wants local communities, local government agencies and mental-health providers to get to them first before they get involved with the courts or detention centers."</p>

<p>House Bill 387 contains many provisions from the re-entry council's bill that died last year after Gov. Phil Bryant's veto. The bill would ensure that Mississippians are not locked up automatically for their inability to pay court fines and fees; allow inmates convicted of certain crimes to be parole eligible after serving 25 percent of their sentence; and create the Mississippi Sentencing Disparity Task Force.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 2841 contains a few similar measures but adds other reforms, too. The measure would remove the requirement in state law that a person's license be suspended after a controlled substance violation, unless the violation is related to operating a vehicle. Additionally, it would require drug courts to make medication-assisted treatment an option for participants and allow judges to suspend or change sentences after a person has begun serving their time.</p>

<p>A group of pastors with Clergy for Prison Reform sat in on the class-action trial against the Mississippi Department of Corrections brought by inmates at East Mississippi Correctional Facility last week.</p>

<p>Rhodes said the group had also monitored the Walnut Grove lawsuit, before that facility closed. "We want to see justice done in East Mississippi," he said. "... Hopefully this will set a precedent for better treatment."</p>

<p>The deadline for lawmakers to concur with amendments made to both House Bill 387 and Senate Bill 2841 is March 22. The East Mississippi Correctional Facility trial continues this week in federal court.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann says he's not running for his current office again, but won't say what he's running for next.</p>

<p>Hosemann, speaking Monday to the Capitol press corps and Mississippi State University's Stennis Institute of Government, said that after three terms in office, he has met his goals as secretary of state and thinks it's time to move on. The Republican says he still has "great interest" in the state, and voters may see his name on a future ballot.</p>

<p>Hosemann isn't saying whether he'd run for U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran's seat this November, the lieutenant governor's post in 2019, or something else — at least not Monday.</p>

<p>The Clarion Ledger reported last week that Hosemann indicated to schoolchildren that he plans a campaign for lieutenant governor.</p>

<p>Something was not sitting right for James Villes. In 2017, after working on a new recording project for about a year and a half, the hip-hop artist and Jackson native, whom fans know as Alexander FRE$CO, says the music just did not seem to flow right to him.</p>

<p>"When I was coming up with the project, which I was supposed to drop last year, I listened to it a couple times, and I was like, 'This is not working. It's up and down, up and down,'" Villes, 26, says.</p>

<p>He already had about 17 completed songs at the time, some that fell into the more straightforward rap arena and some that highlighted more R&amp;B elements, including his singing vocals.</p>

<p>While Villes felt confident in all the songs, he says that he wanted all of them to have a cohesive feel, both as a collection of recordings and as material for live shows.</p>

<p>"As far as me working on performance sets, I can't be all turned up at the beginning and then slow at the end," he says. "I didn't want it to feel like a rollercoaster. I wanted everybody to be on the same vibe, but I most definitely had to separate some things to make it flow."</p>

<p>That separation ultimately resulted in his latest release, "Neon Nights," an R&amp;B-influenced hip-hop project that he put out on Jan. 26. Villes says that he designed "Neon Nights," which features producers Santalus Beats, The Cratez, J-Louis, Pyrmdplaza, Ric &amp; Thadeus and MJ Nichols, for fans to simply press play and let it ride from start to finish. The music also contains a meta-narrative telling the story of a relationship.</p>

<p>The decision to split the project into separate releases also provided Villes, who began seriously pursuing his music career in 2015, with an opportunity to start fresh, rebrand himself and broaden his creative output as an artist.</p>

<p>Before releasing "Neon Nights," Villes removed his previous releases and music videos as Alexander FRE$CO from online for a clean slate. Going forward, he says that he also plans on alternating between rap and R&amp;B releases while gaining feedback to inform what comes next.</p>

<p>"It's really going to depend on the people, how they react it and what they want to hear," he says, "because at the same time, I'm still performing in different places, so it's whatever people want to hear or whatever the mood calls for. ... I'm not one to try to limit myself because it can be a show over here where they're like, 'Hey, they don't do rappers.' Well, guess what? I also do R&amp;B."</p>

<p>While Villes chose to focus on a new, more atmospheric sound for "Neon Nights," fans will not have to wait long to hear a return to his rap roots.</p>

<p>While preparing for this release, he continued perfecting the unreleased hip-hop songs and writing new material. Knowing that his next rap project is already finished took off some of the pressure off of taking greater risks stylistically on "Neon Nights," he says.</p>

<p>"I just put it all as part of the plan because (a rap project) is going to come soon," he says. "I'm not even worried about it. If this is what's going to go for now, I'm going to have those in the stash. They're going to always be ready so I ain't got to be like, 'Well, I've still got to record this, and I've still got to record that.' It's like, 'No, it's already ready to go!'"</p>

<p>Alexander FRE$CO's "Neon Nights" is available now on iTunes, Spotify and SoundCloud. For more information or to purchase a physical copy of the release, visit alexanderfresco.com.</p>

<h2 id="acluaccusesusofbroadlyseparatingimmigrantfamilies">ACLU Accuses US of Broadly Separating Immigrant Families</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-09</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/09/aclu-accuses-us-broadly-separating-immigrant-famil/ </p>

<p>HOUSTON (AP) — The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit Friday accusing the U.S. government of broadly separating immigrant families seeking asylum.</p>

<p>The lawsuit follows action the ACLU took in the case of a Congolese woman and her 7-year-old daughter, who the group said was taken from her mother "screaming and crying" and placed in a Chicago facility. While the woman was released Tuesday from a San Diego detention center, the girl remains in the facility 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away.</p>

<p>Immigrant advocates say the mother and daughter's case is emblematic of the approach taken by President Donald Trump's administration. The lawsuit, which asks a judge to declare family separation unlawful, says "hundreds of families" have been split by immigration authorities.</p>

<p>The lawsuit also raises the case of a Brazilian woman who the ACLU says was separated from her 14-year-old son after they sought asylum in August. The ACLU says the woman was given a roughly 25-day sentence jail sentence for illegally entering the country and then placed in immigration detention facilities in West Texas, while her son was taken to a Chicago facility.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not announced a formal policy to hold adult asylum seekers separately from their children. But administration officials have said they are separating parents and children to deter others from trying to enter the U.S.</p>

<p>DHS acting press secretary Tyler Houlton, in a statement last week on the case of the Congolese woman and her daughter, said government officials have to verify that children entering the U.S. are not victims of traffickers and that the adult accompanying them is actually their parent.</p>

<p>In separate court papers filed Wednesday, the U.S. government said it is awaiting the results of DNA testing to confirm the woman is the girl's mother.</p>

<p>"We ask that members of the public and media view advocacy group claims that we are separating women and children for reasons other than to protect the child with the level of skepticism they deserve," Houlton said.</p>

<p>It's hard to determine how often parents and children are placed in separate facilities after they seek asylum, which is granted to people who have a credible fear of persecution if they are forced to return to their home country.</p>

<p>Different government agencies are responsible for holding adults and children. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detains adults accused of immigration violations, while the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services cares for unaccompanied immigrant children.</p>

<p>Immigration advocates criticized President Barack Obama's administration for opening new family detention facilities in Texas and called for parents and children to be released. The two Texas facilities that it opened were found by a federal judge in 2015 to violate a long-standing 1997 settlement requiring children be released or otherwise held in the "least restrictive setting" available.</p>

<p>That settlement set other standards for the detention of children. The Trump administration has called for ending the settlement as part of its demands for changes to immigration laws.</p>

<p>Top administration officials have said they believe the asylum process is overwhelmed and challenged by people making frivolous claims. Advocates have also accused border agents of unlawfully turning away people who are seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

<p>Michelle Brané, director of the migrant rights and justice program for the Women's Refugee Commission, said that through attorneys and social service organizations, she had identified at least 426 immigrant adults and children who had been separated by authorities since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. Brané said she did not have a comparable figure for Obama's administration.</p>

<p>But Brané said since the new administration began, her office has received far more reports of adults being held in ICE facilities without knowing where their children are.</p>

<p>"A lot of these kids are already afraid because they're fleeing something and they know they're fleeing something," Brané said. "And to have them pulled away, that can be devastating for a parent."</p>

<h2 id="civilrightsmuseumenjoystrumplessgrandopening">Civil Rights Museum Enjoys ‘Trump-less’ Grand Opening</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Lynch</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-07</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/07/civil-rights-museum-enjoys-trump-less-grand-openin/ </p>

<p>The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum held an intentionally "Trump-less" second grand opening presented by the Friends of Mississippi Civil Rights Inc. and the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, with help from the Mississippi-Branch NAACP and the national NAACP. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>It was a scene that should have made President Donald Trump proud. Hundreds of people, including some members of Congress who had unpatriotically boycotted his State of the Union and generally did their best to perfidiously avoid their own president, all seemingly reclaimed their nationalism and stood alongside civil-rights titans. They rose, hands on their chests, eyes forward, proudly reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and singing the national anthem. No smile looked forced, and everybody seemed to be loving their nation that day.</p>

<p>This was the Feb. 24 symposium at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum—an intentionally "Trump-less" second grand opening—presented by the Friends of Mississippi Civil Rights Inc. and the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, with help from the Mississippi-Branch NAACP and the national NAACP. Plenty were involved, and none denied Trump's contribution.</p>

<p>"I recall when we got the word that (Gov. Phil Bryant) was going to invite a person from D.C.—who shall not be named—to come and celebrate the opening of this museum, Congressman (Bennie) Thompson and I ... decided that this was not appropriate. This was not supposed to be the time for a photo op. This was not an opportunity for (Trump) to leverage our sacrifice and our history for his political use," said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson.</p>

<p>Bryant hit a nerve with his invite last December after the racially tone-deaf president failed to disavow white nationalists during recent neo-Nazi demonstrations. Trump's dismantling of the civil-rights office at the Department of Justice also doesn't help. Additionally, somehow, the governor had missed the fact that one of the biggest names attending the museum's Dec. 9 opening was the wife of slain civil-rights activist Medgar Evers, whose sacrifice is recognized in museum exhibits. A Ku Klux Klan member shot Myrlie Evers-Williams' husband in the back in 1963 and left him to die in his driveway, surrounded by his wailing family.</p>

<p>Setting the widow up to join a president endorsed by the Klan was a potentially devastating exercise in awkwardness.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed ready to move on from that event. Event speakers, including U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., U.S. Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., and civil-rights colossus U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., all seemed to be trying to exorcise Trump from the premises, like a malicious spirit or an unexplained fish smell.</p>

<p>Richmond, for example, did everything in his power to build a box labeled "BACKWARDS" and pile everything Trump-related into it. The administration, he said, was on the wrong end of the very struggle the museum represents and proof that the champions of civil rights' battle was not yet won.</p>

<p>"The fights they fought we unfortunately have to fight again," Richmond said, and then ticked off a multi-point countdown of every backward step the administration staggered through this past year. This included rolling back voting rights, and enabling or supporting vote suppression efforts, and eroding money slated to help police restore trust in minority communities.</p>

<p>Other speakers called out Trump for appointing unqualified and racially biased judges to the bench, and defunding education and affordable-housing efforts. Many scoffed at his claim of African American unemployment as the "lowest rate ever recorded," when black unemployment is still almost double that of whites.</p>

<p>The symposium was undoubtedly a call to arms, but the overall mood was still light and upbeat, and with good reason. On the way in, attendees filed past a throng of optimistic and engaged young visitors, many socially aware and politically driven. This is a group with an interest in the museum and its message that could even help the facility surpass attendance expectations. Before symposium attendees knew it, this new, mobilized generation of laughing youth had piled in around them, crushing them—and they were seemingly in delightful harmony with it all.</p>

<p>Naturally, this contributed to an ambient sense of hope and renewal. Lewis, himself, clearly felt it.</p>

<p>"I wasn't here the last time," said Lewis (who had made a point not to be), "but I have the sense that this time there is something a little more spiritual here, and a little freer, more inclusive."</p>

<h2 id="after7shootingsjpdstillshieldsofficers">After 7 Shootings, JPD Still Shields Officers</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-07</p>

<p>Tetrina Blalock came to the Feb. 27 Jackson City Council meeting on behalf of her cousin, Lee Edward Bonner, who died from a Jackson police officer-involved shooting on Feb. 21 in west Jackson. She called the incident “overkill.” Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Lee Edward Bonner, 37, died after a Jackson police officer shot him on Feb. 21 in west Jackson. His family says it was "an overkill," while the City released scant information painting Bonner as the instigator of a shoot-out during a drug investigation gone awry.</p>

<p>"We're not saying he was right. We're not saying he was perfect, but we want justice, and we want to find out what happened by legal standards," Tetrina Blalock, Bonner's cousin, told Jackson City Council on Feb. 27. They also do not know who shot him, yet.</p>

<p>JPD spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said two detectives in plain clothes were conducting a narcotics investigation, and started chasing Bonner and another man they may not have ever found. Police said Bonner displayed a weapon and fired at police, and officers returned fire. Bonner later died of injuries sustained in the altercation.</p>

<p>All the public can know for sure is that the two officers involved in Bonner's shooting are on paid leave pending investigation, which the mayor said the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations will assist. Despite repeated requests, JPD has not released names of officers in the Bonner shooting or any linked to the other six officer-involved shootings since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba took office in July 2017.</p>

<p>Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore, whom the mayor called a man of few words when he took over the position in January, has been true to that description. He has offered little information during press conferences and public meetings as to JPD's use-of-force policy or investigation status, saying only that the department will not release identities of officers who shot civilians in order to protect the cops' safety.</p>

<p>At a government affairs committee meeting at City Hall on Tuesday, Moore brought hard copies of the use-of-force policy. Asked for a copy, a city clerk told the Jackson Free Press to file a public-records request and then a copy would be uploaded to the record system. The JFP had filed the records request the day before, and still did not receive the policy by press time for this article. It is now attached to the story.</p>

<p>Improving policing has been a national conversation since a Ferguson, Mo., police officer killed Michael Brown in August 2014. Citizens and government entities have demanded more transparency from police departments, including the use of body cameras.</p>

<p>However, even when wearing cameras, officers can lie or departments refuse to release the videos, and studies and reports point to their questionable effectiveness. Either way, Moore said JPD cannot afford body cameras.</p>

<p>Vagueness paired with local leaders hinting that Jackson is not one of those cities with the policing issues of yonder mean families like those of Bonner and concerned citizens are left both unaware and potentially unsafe due to the lack of transparency about police shootings.</p>

<p>Policing the Police</p>

<p>Blalock, Bonner's cousin, was one of four people to take the microphone at a crowded Feb. 27 city council meeting to air out concerns about Jackson's policing. She spoke for the Bonner family with clear demands: an independent investigation and autopsy.</p>

<p>"Who is to police the police?" she asked in chambers, alluding to a conundrum many communities face as they try to penetrate many departments' codes of silence and protection for officers.</p>

<p>BuzzFeed News published an investigation titled "Blue Lies Matter" in January 2017 after reviewing 62 incidents of video footage nationally since 2008, with more than 60 percent taking place since 2014. All contradicted an officer's statement in a police report or testimony. The report says that although police are often considered to be the "most reliable narrators in a courtroom," video footage erodes that "bedrock of the justice system" and proves that officers lie "with increasing frequency."</p>

<p>"Cameras prove cops lie, and there are more cameras out in the world today than ever before," BuzzFeed reporter Albert Samaha wrote in the article. "...Officers lie in high-profile cases and little-known cases, and lie by fabrication, omission and exaggeration."</p>

<p>The nation saw broader demand for body cameras following the Michael Brown shooting as an unbiased intermediary to reveal the facts of a case. A 2017 report on body-worn cameras points to the benefit of transparency, but also a potential slippery slope.</p>

<p>"(C)ameras could be used to intensify disproportionate surveillance and enforcement in heavily policed communities of color," The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights &amp; Upturn report reads. "Without carefully crafted policy safeguards in place, there is a real risk that these new devices could become instruments of injustice, rather than tools for accountability."</p>

<p>Many of Jackson's officer-involved cases would be considered "little-known cases" broadly speaking, but even locals know little details about them. Without the funds for body-cam videos, things are even less open here.</p>

<p>Jackson residents have no way of knowing pivotal information about officer-involved shootings in a timely fashion, including which ones have been involved in multiple incidents or even how long these officers have been employed.</p>

<p>Holmes, JPD's spokesman, told the Jackson Free Press last week that there have been five officer-involved shootings since July 2017, but this newspaper has counted seven from JPD's Twitter feed and media reports. The mayor said he has not decided his position on identifying cops involved in shootings, yet.</p>

<p>Meantime, Chief Moore is choosing to hide the identities over public transparency. Both Holmes and Moore confirmed that they will not name officers who shoot civilians until a decision comes back from a grand jury—a process that could take a year or more given backlog in the district attorney's office.</p>

<p>It is a relatively new JPD policy, as Moore told the Council on Feb. 27, that an officer is not to return to duty if a suspect dies during an officer-involved shooting until a grand jury clears them. Prior to Moore, officers were returning to duty pending a psychological investigation, Moore said.</p>

<p>In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice advised police departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident. Some cities release them as soon as 48 hours after the shooting. The DOJ report said that departments can take steps to ensure officer safety during those brief delays.</p>

<p>'Overkill Is Overkill'</p>

<p>At the council podium, Blalock fired off two landmark Supreme Court decisions from the 1980s about use-of-force: Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor. The former involved an unarmed 15-year-old boy named Edward Garner whom a police officer shot with a hollow-tip bullet in the back of the head to keep him from escaping over a fence.</p>

<p>Garner was a suspect in a nearby house robbery, and he later died. The Supreme Court in 1985 decided that deadly force to prevent an unarmed fleeing felon's escape was unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Dethorne Graham was having an insulin reaction at home in 1984 and a friend took him to the store to get orange juice to fix it. An officer nearby named M.S. Connor thought Graham seemed suspicious for quickly entering and leaving the store, and pulled Graham and his friend over. Graham's foot was broken during the traffic stop among other injuries, although the officer determined that Graham had not committed a crime.</p>

<p>In Graham v. Connor, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 1989 that Graham's claims had to be evaluated under the Fourth Amendment's "objective reasonableness" through an officer on the scene, rather than a generalized "excessive force standard." Lower courts had accepted that good-faith efforts can measure the degree of force.</p>

<p>"If it fell into those two standards, I will accept that—that's the law," Blalock told the city council.</p>

<p>"But, overkill is overkill. I don't know what's on the books as far as what Jackson Police Department is to do (with a suspect), but it wasn't a violent situation. If (the officer) was shooting him, why was (Bonner's) leg not an option?"</p>

<p>In terms of an intermediary use-of-force, Moore told the council that not every officer has a Taser nor are they all Taser-certified, although he did characterize them as an option for when suspects resist or are aggressive. The chief said JPD officers do not use a Taser on suspects that are running away because they could fall.</p>

<p>On Nov. 15, 2017, JPD shot an unidentified black man in the leg when he was running away from police and allegedly pointed a black object at officers, after which they heard a shot.</p>

<p>The mayor has suggested that Jackson does not mirror other instances of officer-involved shootings around the nation. During a press conference on Feb. 26 to announce that JPD will no longer release mugshots of people police shoot, Lumumba acknowledged the complexities communities of color have always had with law enforcement.</p>

<p>With Jackson's majority-black police force, Lumumba said, the national trends around violence do not reflect what happens here—implying that our demographics make our city immune to over-policing as occurred in Ferguson, Mo., for instance.</p>

<p>The information JPD keeps in the shadows might suggest otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="ringingthebellonkidschargedasadults">Ringing the Bell on Kids Charged as Adults</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-07</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/07/ringing-bell-kids-charged-adults/ </p>

<p>Johnnie McDaniels, executive director of the Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center, wants law enforcement and the Hinds County district attorney’s office to stop the “finger pointing.” He says youth charged as adults are sitting in his detention facility for more than 100 days. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Johnnie McDaniels, executive director of Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center, often repeats a Frederick Douglass quote.</p>

<p>"It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men," Douglas wrote in 1855.</p>

<p>"And I'll add women to that," McDaniels said in an interview at the youth detention center on Feb. 28.</p>

<p>McDaniels' job requires him to repair broken children, especially those who have been charged as adults. Many of them sit in his facility for the better part of a year awaiting court dates, convictions and indictments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, those exclusively in the youth system tend to be in and out in a maximum 21-day window, as a consent decree between Hinds County and plaintiffs in a 2011 lawsuit over the conditions at the center mandates. Mississippi law and youth-court rules allow 90 days for the initial delinquency youth-court hearing process after the youth-court prosecutor files the petition in a child's case.</p>

<p>In reality, at least half the kids currently in the Henley-Young detention center are presumably innocent. Their inability to post bail or a judge revoking it at their initial hearing forces them to stay detained until they either find the money or the district attorney's office assigns their case to the docket, which takes time.</p>

<p>Of the 23 juveniles in the facility as of Feb. 28, a dozen are charged as adults—11 boys and one girl. Of that dozen, nine have been at Henley-Young for more than 90 days, and only two of them have been indicted in Hinds County.</p>

<p>Overall, McDaniels has seven juveniles who have been there from 102 to 178 days without an indictment.</p>

<p>Juveniles charged as adults get all the protections and services those under 18 receive—regular school schedules and mental-health counseling—but they suffer all the backlog embedded in the adult system as their childhoods tick away. McDaniels is worried about what long-term stays do to the youth there, but also whether what is happening as a potential result of political pressure, case mismanagement and finger-pointing violates juvenile rights.</p>

<p>"It is constitutionally suspect to me that a 16-year-old or a 14-year-old charged with a serious offense, which they could get life in jail for, will sit un-indicted for 178 days," McDaniels told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Juveniles Get Due Process, Too</p>

<p>A 15-year-old Arizona boy named Gerald "Jerry" Gault helped change the juvenile-justice system in the 1960s. A friend made an obscene call to a woman while at Gault's house, and when the woman filed a complaint, police arrested Jerry without notifying his parents nor mentioning his legal right to an attorney. Gault's mother could not bring him home, and a week later he was sentenced to nearly six years in a juvenile-detention facility.</p>

<p>As of Feb. 28, 2018, nearly half of the juveniles at Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center are being charged as adults.</p>

<p>Three years later, in May 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in Gault's favor, establishing juveniles' right to delinquency proceedings under the same due-process rights adults have in criminal trials. That includes the right to counsel, timely notification of charges, the right to appeal and the right to avoid self-incrimination.</p>

<p>"Under our Constitution, the condition of being a boy does not justify a kangaroo court," Justice Abe Fortas wrote in the 1967 opinion.</p>

<p>The justice added that in the "traditional ideas" of juvenile court procedure, authorities should have considered whether it was a prank that parents could have dealt with at home. Fortas also pointed out that Gault received much harsher punishments as a juvenile than he would have if he were 18 at the time—the maximum punishment would have been a fine of $5 to $50, or imprisonment in jail for not more than two months, he wrote.</p>

<p>More than 50 years after that landmark decision, Mississippi juveniles get placed into the adult system at the law-enforcement level when he or she is still presumably innocent—often with media publishing mugshots and asking for "perp" walks for video of the accused children.</p>

<p>Patrick Webb, an associate professor of criminal justice at St. Augustine's University, a historically black college in Raleigh, N.C., has done research on the relationship between media coverage and juvenile proceedings.</p>

<p>"Exposing children to 'hey, look this is what can happen to you, look at this perp walk, look at this kid behind these bars,' it may frighten him and it may expose him, but it's not going to change his thinking," Webb said in an November 2017 interview. "It will only frighten him and shock him and entertain him and leave an impression, but that impression will not be permanent, and it will not lead to a change of behavior."</p>

<p>In other jurisdictions in the U.S., youth under 18 go before a youth-court judge who decides on the level of the charges and if the juvenile at hand will be treated as an adult before being subjected to the potential damage of a media circus.</p>

<p>McDaniels says Mississippi should adopt the latter practice, but for now, at least, he wants law enforcement and the district attorney's office to take ownership over moving juvenile cases through the system swiftly.</p>

<p>As it currently goes, McDaniels says the district attorney's office blames the initial investigation the police do for delays—often telling McDaniels they have to re-investigate. When he speaks to law enforcement officers, they blame backlog in the district attorney's office.</p>

<p>"It just kind of depends on who I'm talking to in terms of what answer I get," McDaniels said, "which is frustrating in a sense that someone should say at that point the court should be involved in this process."</p>

<p>Regardless of fault, juveniles sit awaiting justice in cases that might not have necessary evidence to move their charges forward. Many young people are detained after their bond hearings, so even if a judge decides to kick their cases into youth court, they have to wait to get onto the docket to do so. The longer the juveniles are away from their community, schools and family, the more frustrated they get, McDaniels said.</p>

<p>'That's Not Fair'</p>

<p>Having spent a decade as a city prosecutor, McDaniels said he often puts his "old attorney hat on" to explain where kids charged as adults are in the process, especially when they do not understand why they have not gotten bond or why their stint is so long this time versus other times they may have been to the facility.</p>

<p>"But for the most part ... some of them understand the seriousness of it, and that (they) may leave here, and the next stop may be Parchman," McDaniels said of the notorious prison in the Mississippi Delta.</p>

<p>McDaniels said other kids tell him: "I'm not guilty of what they're accusing me of, but I've been in here for 170 days. Mr. McDaniels, that's not fair."</p>

<p>McDaniels is particularly sensitive to how juveniles are treated in the media before they get there.</p>

<p>On Feb. 26, the mayor issued an executive order banning the police from sending out mugshots of civilians that officers shoot, and said at the press conference that he would also have JPD stop giving out mugshots of juveniles, even if they're being charged as adults.</p>

<p>Before that, JPD sent out and tweeted mugshots of kids as young as 13—the minimum age one can be charged as an adult in this state.</p>

<p>Weeks ago, JPD disseminated one of a 14-year-old girl charged with capital murder and already in custody.</p>

<p>In a 2008 study, Webb presented a theory that suggested public embarrassment from the media and other tactics could teach children to abstain from criminal behavior to avoid public embarrassment to themselves and their families and to keep from jeopardizing their futures.</p>

<p>But, Webb says, these fear-backed, short-term measures like "Scared Straight" tough talks and media "dog-and-pony" shows only create temporary behavior changes. He says the best way to discourage anti-social behavior is not to intimidate or shame the person.</p>

<p>Backed by research, McDaniels fears that some of the same juveniles "castigated" on local TV news may have difficulties going back into school, classroom settings and the community because of the coverage, even if nearly a year passes before they are indicted.</p>

<p>"There's always political pressure on a case that has been highlighted in the news, and the community has a bunch of perspective on what they think has occurred, but the facts may not be what they suggest," McDaniels said.</p>

<p>McDaniels wants law enforcement and the Hinds County district attorney's office to stop the "finger pointing" at each other and work together for a solution.</p>

<p>"That's not a mean-spirited criticism of any of the other parties that are involved in this process, whether it's law enforcement, district attorney's office, or whomever," McDaniels said in the interview.</p>

<p>"But, I think we have to ring the bell at this point and say that the current system is simply not working, and we've got to do some things different in Hinds County."</p>

<p>JACKSON — In one of his more assertive and direct public statements, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba refuted an ethics complaint from a branch of a local conservative think tank accusing the City of Jackson of destroying immigration records called detainers. But he left it unclear whether or not they receive those documents in the first place.</p>

<p>On Monday, Shadrack White, director of the Mississippi Justice Institute, filed a public-records complaint with the Mississippi Ethics Commission after asking for all records concerning any Jackson Police Department detainer or immigration hold requests back to January 2014. In a Jan. 31 letter responding to the records request, JPD said it neither keeps nor maintains such records. White and the MJI took that to mean the JPD "simply throws requests to hold illegal immigrants in the garbage."</p>

<p>Immigration Customs and Enforcement, called ICE, sends detainers to local law enforcement when it arrests someone believed to be in the country without proper documentation so the agency can take custody of detailed immigrants when released. White had requested copies of the detainers the City of Jackson had received, arguing that if the City no longer has them, it must have destroyed them.</p>

<p>"This is a meritless, baseless, senseless, waste of time, and this is an out-and-out lie," Lumumba said at the press conference. "It is alternative facts, if you will. This administration has not destroyed anything."</p>

<p>Lumumba likened the accusations to what would happen if he tried to withdraw a million dollars from his bank account. "Well, I will never get the million dollars out of my account because I don't have a million dollars, right?" the mayor said. "I can't provide what we don't have; I can't provide what we don't take in. I can't destroy what we don't collect. So that is why it is a baseless accusation, and it is political in nature."</p>

<p>The mayor, however, did not make it clear where the "million dollars"—in this case, the detainers—are at this time.</p>

<p>White asked the Mississippi Ethics Commission to require the JPD to release records about immigration detainers requested in January, call witnesses from the JPD to testify about departmental policies for ICE detainers, require any documents that speak to said policy, and to grant an oral argument for MJI's request. He told reporters after the mayor spoke that this complaint is about preserving government transparency and public safety, especially after the U.S Department of Justice under President Donald Trump's tenure named Jackson as one of the sanctuary cities around the country.</p>

<p>"The goal of getting the information is to make sure every citizen in Jackson knows just how bad this problem is, just how many people have been arrested by JPD and then released back onto the streets without being turned over to ICE," White told reporters. He added that every taxpayer in Jackson deserves to know what's going on, and then they can pressure on the City to fix the problem.</p>

<p>"Sunshine is a really good disinfectant in these places, and that's what we need, we need sunshine," White said.</p>

<p>In late January, the Department of Justice sent a letter to Jackson officials asking for all documents, instructions, and guidance to law enforcement employees pertaining to how they "may or may not" communicate with ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>Lumumba said in January that documents showing its communication with ICE do not exist.</p>

<p>Under a 2010 city ordinance that cements anti-profiling protections, Jackson police officers cannot ask about a person's immigration status unless it is in the course of a criminal investigation or necessary to assist federal law enforcement. The Justice Department took issue with this aspect of city code.</p>

<p>"Racial profiling is patently illegal," Lumumba told reporters in January. "... Furthermore, racial profiling is ineffective. It alienates communities from law enforcement, disrupts community policing efforts, and causes law enforcement to forfeit credibility and trust among the people they are sworn to protect and serve."</p>

<p>White told reporters Monday the end goal is for the City to say exactly what it does with the ICE detainers and to start maintaining them, and if the City wants to change its sanctuary-city policy, that would also be a good thing.</p>

<p>Recently appointed U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst formerly directed legal efforts at the MJI when it was created two years ago.</p>

<p>The case against the Mississippi Department of Corrections for its treatment of prisoners at East Mississippi Correctional Facility goes to trial this week. Photo courtesy MDOC</p>

<p>JACKSON — Rats crawling out of toilets. Cells with no lights. Inmates dying in solitary confinement with zip ties around their wrists and ankles. This is a sample of the laundry list of deficiencies the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU National Prison Project outlined in a lawsuit filed in 2013 against the Mississippi Department of Corrections.</p>

<p>Inmates housed at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility alleged squalor conditions, solitary confinement practices, lack of medical and mental health care, and an overall unsafe environment. Five years later, the case goes to trial before U.S. District Judge William Barbour today.</p>

<p>Jody Owens, the managing attorney at SPLC who was in the facility last week, describes EMCF as in "consistent chaos." He said four inmates have died in the last two months alone.</p>

<p>"Our investigations support that two have been overdoses, one has been an individual who could not get the help he needed as he choked on his lunch," Owens told reporters last week. "That has been the history of East Mississippi from then to now—a lack of security, safety and staff."</p>

<p>EMCF is one of three state private prisons that the Utah-based Management and Training Corporation operates, mostly in southern states. Of the 1,200 inmates there, the facility primarily houses inmates with mental-health issues or special medical needs. The lawsuit charges that MDOC has not done its part to ensure that contractors are keeping prisoners safe and healthy.</p>

<p>SPLC and the ACLU began their investigation of the facility in 2011 and sent then-MDOC Commissioner Chris Epps a letter demanding changes to the facility. MDOC declined, and Owens said MDOC has refused to settle the case twice during the last five years of litigation.</p>

<p>MDOC for its part has denied the majority of allegations in the lawsuit and has asked the judge to throw out the case. The attorney general's office has hired private attorneys to help defend the state in the case. MTC manages the facility in Meridian, and Centurion of Mississippi, partnership between MHM Services and Centene, provides medical care for prisoners there (as well as the rest of the state's prison system) with headquarters in St. Louis, Mo., the Mississippi Secretary of State's website shows. MHM Services is not registered with the secretary of state, but St. Louis-based Centene Management Company registered in Mississippi as an LLC in 2011.</p>

<p>MTC took over the facility in July 2012, after attorneys began their investigation. The corporation maintains that conditions at EMCF have improved. In an emailed statement, which avoids specifics of the case, MTC emphasized its adequate staffing levels, new security measures (like a body scanner) and a GED program.</p>

<p>"The facility is safe, secure, clean, and well run. From the warden on down, our staff are trained to treat the men in our care with dignity and respect. Our mission is to help these men make choices in prison and after they're released that will lead to a new and successful life in society," the statement said.</p>

<p>"The facility is accredited by the American Correctional Association and the Correctional Education Association. It's also 100% compliant with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act, which was created to further protect the rights of inmates," the statement continued.</p>

<p>Centurion is the third medical-provider contractor at the facility since the litigation began. MDOC is also on its third commissioner since the litigation began; the initial complaint names former Commissioner Chris Epps, who is serving time in federal prison now after he was convicted of a bribery scheme.</p>

<p>Erin Monju, an attorney at Covington &amp; Burling representing the plaintiffs, said the facility still does not have a staff psychiatrist.</p>

<p>"It is also the Mississippi Department of Correction's obligation to ensure that their contractors abide by the contract paid for with Mississippi tax dollars, but across these three contractors, (the department) has failed to ensure prisoners are receiving adequate health care, and they have failed to hold these contractors to their obligation," Monju told reporters last week.</p>

<p>Taxpayers foot the bill for private prisons, as well as for the contractors operating within them. In the 1990s, lawmakers took out bonds to pay for private prisons, and that debt service will not be paid off until fiscal-year 2028. The state is currently paying more than $6 million in debt service this year for EMCF. Attorneys said the contract with Centurion is valued at more than $50 million in taxpayer money.</p>

<p>Attorneys representing the inmates expect the trial, which Judge Barbour will decide and not a jury, to go on for a few weeks. They plan to call experts, inmates and possibly former prison staff members as witnesses during the trial. Just how much conditions have improved—or not—will likely become clear during the trial as well as how much MDOC has worked to hold private contractors accountable for changing the environment, health and practices in the facility.</p>

<p>Correction: A previous version of this story said former MDOC Commissioner Chris Epps was serving time in MDOC. He is not. He is serving time in federal prison. We apologize for the error. </p>

<h2 id="theracistrootsofdisenfranchisingvoters">The Racist Roots of Disenfranchising Voters</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-02-28</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/feb/28/racist-roots-disenfranchising-voters/ </p>

<p>Corey Wiggins, the executive director of the Mississippi NAACP, called on lawmakers to work to restore voting rights for the more than 218,000 Mississippians who are disenfranchised, at a press conference at the Capitol this session. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Anthony Witherspoon calls it "divine intervention." Others might call it luck. The second-term mayor of Magnolia, Miss., learned quickly how state laws can disenfranchise and significantly alter a person's life, all depending on what crimes they have committed.</p>

<p>Witherspoon, who is black, was convicted of manslaughter in 1992 after shooting a man "in self-defense" after having six or seven rounds fired at him, he says today. The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected two lower court rulings that he was guilty of murder, and ultimately a jury convicted him of manslaughter, and he drew a 20-year prison sentence. Witherspoon stayed out of prison for four years on an appeal bond and then served six years in state prison.</p>

<p>As soon as he got to prison in 1996, Witherspoon began to research his voting rights, and found that manslaughter is not one of the 22 disenfranchising crimes in Mississippi.</p>

<p>"[I] discovered that ... there were only 10 felonies that disenfranchised someone from their voting rights if convicted of a felony," Witherspoon recalled. "It said murder, but it didn't say my charge, which was manslaughter. It said rape but not aggravated assault."</p>

<p>Witherspoon wrote a letter to the attorney general asking for clarification. The answer was clear: He still had his right to vote. He wrote his circuit clerk and asked for an absentee ballot to be sent to prison. Witherspoon went on to register several other inmates who were eligible to vote as well. Any Mississippian, who is a U.S. citizen and has never been convicted of voter fraud or one of the 22 disenfranchising crimes can register to vote and has the right to vote, including men and women in prison.</p>

<p>"I actually started registering inmates to vote while in prison, and we continued that campaign once I got out of prison," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Witherspoon worked with the ACLU of Mississippi and the NAACP to help educate Mississippians about the specific list of disenfranchising crimes. When Witherspoon got out of prison in 2002, voter registration forms still no disclaimers about disenfranchising crimes, so he worked with the ACLU on an education campaign in order to register more formally incarcerated Mississippians to vote.</p>

<p>One of the disenfranchising crimes in the 1890 Mississippi Constitution is "theft," which is not currently defined in state law. In 2012, Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann published a list of 22 disenfranchising crimes, based on a 2009 attorney general's opinion.</p>

<p>"Theft" is still on the list, as well as receiving stolen property, timber larceny, unlawful taking of motor vehicle, carjacking and felony shoplifting. Arson, armed robbery, bigamy, murder and robbery also make the list.</p>

<p>Witherspoon's manslaughter conviction also meant he could hold public office, despite not being allowed to get his violent offense expunged. In November 1992, the Legislature had added two exceptions to the law that kept anyone convicted of a felony from running for office: manslaughter and tax violations.</p>

<p>Witherspoon was convicted of manslaughter in November 1992.</p>

<p>"I guarantee that this little country boy did not have that kind of pull with the Legislature, but that's what happened," Witherspoon said.</p>

<p>In the Courtroom</p>

<p>The ACLU of Mississippi attempted to sue the state for its list of disenfranchising crimes when Witherspoon worked there—but did not succeed.</p>

<p>Now, the Mississippi Center for Justice is challenging this list in federal court. Changing the list of disenfranchising crimes could change voter turnout for several counties across the state.</p>

<p>Mississippi is one of 12 states with disenfranchisement laws that can affect people for life. The list of 22 disenfranchising crimes means an estimated 218,181 people in the state are unable to vote, a new study from the Sentencing Project, One Voice and the Mississippi NAACP, shows. In an analysis of 2016 data, researchers found that 93 percent of those disenfranchised on Mississippi's list live in the community—not behind bars.</p>

<p>"Mississippi has one of the most extreme policies. It's one of the states that disenfranchises people for life unless there's intervention either from the governor or from this onerous process where people have to file individual suffrage bills," Nicole Porter with the Sentencing Project told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Mississippians looking to restore their voting rights must petition the governor for a pardon or executive order or ask their district's lawmakers to introduce a suffrage bill on their behalf, a process that is far from a guarantee. Gov. Phil Bryant has not restored anyone's right to vote during either of his terms and has not signed a single suffrage bill. Suffrage bills, brought by lawmakers on behalf of their constituents, become effective with two-thirds of the Legislature's approval, with or without his signature.</p>

<p>Since 2007, 45 suffrage bills have passed and 83 failed, the Sentencing Project report shows. During Bryant's first and recent term, lawmakers passed 15 suffrage bills.</p>

<p>Some states have automatic voter-rights restoration for people as soon as they leave prison or jail. Maryland just expanded voting rights to people in the community on probation or parole and increased its voter rolls by an estimated 40,000 residents, Porter said. In Mississippi, a similar measure could allow more than 200,000 residents the right to vote again, based on 2016 numbers.</p>

<p>A measure to study disenfranchisement passed the House this year with bipartisan support, and on Monday, Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, passed the bill through the Senate Judiciary B Committee, noting constitutional issues with the list of disenfranchising crimes.</p>

<p>Senate leadership referred House Bill 774to Judiciary B and the Senate Rules Committee. By press time both committees passed the measure, so the full Senate will vote on it in the coming week. Similar measures have died in the Senate in previous years.</p>

<p>A Racist List of Crimes?</p>

<p>Felony disenfranchisement still disproportionately affects African Americans in the state. At a press conference this month, the Mississippi NAACP called on lawmakers to change the state's stringent disenfranchising laws.</p>

<p>"Mississippi's restrictive suffrage laws do not go far enough in providing a meaningful opportunity for enfranchisement," Corey Wiggins, executive director of the Mississippi NAACP, said in a press release.</p>

<p>"To deny people the fundamental right to vote is at odds with ample evidence showing the expansion of voting rights not only leads to safer communities but has widespread public support."</p>

<p>Nearly 16 percent of the black electorate in the state are disenfranchised, the Sentencing Project report found, using 2016 numbers. Disenfranchising crimes were initially targeted along racial lines. In the 15 years following the Civil War, states ramped up disenfranchising crimes, immediately following black men gaining their right to vote.</p>

<p>"The list of crimes that's in our state Constitution was adopted in 1890 because it was thought that black people were more likely than white people to commit these crimes, and this was one of a number of provisions that the constitution of 1890 (had) seeking to make it more difficult for black people to exercise their voting rights," Bryan said Monday.</p>

<p>Just as Jim Crow laws would do well into the 1960s, the point of the disenfranchisement law was to keep black people from voting.</p>

<p>"The motivation for enacting broad felony disenfranchisement laws in this context was clear: preventing newly enfranchised black citizens from exercising political power," Erin Kelley writes in a 2017 Brennan Center report.</p>

<p>Mississippi's disenfranchisement law was used as a model for other states, when it was adopted in the state's 1890 Constitution, and even the state Supreme Court acknowledged the racist ties to disenfranchisement, while upholding the list as constitutional six years later.</p>

<p>"Restrained by the federal constitution from discriminating against the negro race, the convention discriminated against its characteristics and the offenses to which its weaker member were prone. ... Burglary, theft, arson, and obtaining money under false pretenses were declared to be disqualifications [from voting], while robbery and murders, and other crimes in which violence was the principal ingredient, were not," the report states.</p>

<p>Bryan, who is white, said that Alabama had a similar provision in its constitution that the U.S. Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Witherspoon said that during his work with the ACLU of Mississippi he learned that public education was necessary to inform not only inmates but also circuit clerks that going to jail or prison alone is not grounds for losing the right to vote. Today, the disenfranchising crimes are listed on voter-registration forms and online.</p>

<p>"Now it's 22 (disenfranchising crimes). So you know, now it's 12 that have been applied without an act from the Legislature. I don't understand how you can amend the Constitution outside a legislative act, but that's where we are," Witherspoon said.</p>

<h2 id="editorsnotemoveonfromantiquatedanduselessgangbill">EDITOR'S NOTE: Move On from ‘Antiquated and Useless’ Gang Bill</h2>

<p>David Kennedy, a John Jay College criminal-justice professor and director of the National Network for Safe Communities, helped develop and implement Operation Ceasefire in cities across the country to counter violence. He says that efforts to police gangs, such as in Mississippi's failed gang bill, are “antiquated and useless.” Instead, police and communities must focus on the people who commit violence, he says.

<p>Donna Ladd</p>

<p>Whew, that nightmare is over. A very bad "gang bill" has died in the Legislature for the second year in a row. This death occurred after the Senate passed its bill to criminalize gang association and give expanded sentences to associates of gangs or crews or cliques for up to 15 years. The House version had already died, leaving the Senate version as the one to live or die.</p>

<p>The bill died after a year of The Clarion-Ledger carrying heavy water for the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators, a wild-west-esque cop group that wants to round up the gangsters, old-school style. All last year, their reporter of "crime/breaking/mayhem" (per Twitter) kept quoting the bill's supporters proclaiming "a gang problem!" and reported MAGI members saying they wanted to lock up people simply for being in a gang—guilt by association. A similar gang bill died last year after its sponsor used the same arguments for it.</p>

<p>That reporter seldom interviews anyone about the gang bill other than law enforcement who want to send more young people to gang-infested prisons where they're likely to come out worse criminals. She doesn't talk to former gang members, which isn't hard at all to do, not to give up my trade secrets. And I have never seen her hunt down an actual criminologist, just taking every MAGI word as gospel.</p>

<p>MAGI even has a "Never Back Down" logo of a skull with dripping blood (or maybe it's milk?) over an apparent AR-15. The logo brings the slogan to mind of the now-disbanded NYPD Street Crimes Unit that shot unarmed Amadou Diallo 41 times in his yard: "We own the night." The SCU even had a Hemingway quote printed on their shirts: "Certainly there is no hunting of man like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never really care for anything else thereafter."</p>

<p>A proposed gang bill was not based on current evidence-based violence research. It died in the Legislature.</p>

<p>The problem with MAGI's gang bill is that it was circular, leaving no confidence that the people behind it were trying to seek good information and evidence-based strategy. They surveyed cops at a November 2017 convention (which that reporter attended) and sent the lists of suspected gangs to the local Homeland Security's "fusion center," which kicked MAGI back a report in December using their data to back the gang bill in January. Then Sen. Brice Wiggins, the bill's sponsor (whom the reporter had quoted all year), took to the floor and argued for it because, you know, gangs are bad. See Spot run.</p>

<p>Then, after it came out that the fusion report MAGI provided information to had doubled the number of gang members in Mississippi prisons, the reporter managed to distill the opposition to the bill into "civil-rights groups" and "the Black Caucus."</p>

<p>No, Ledger. The strongest opposition to any such gang bill, and police obsessing about gangs in general, actually comes from crime and violence experts who work daily to end violent crime and use both the research and the evidence-based practices the whole country of violence experts knows about in 2018. It's hard to type the words "gang violence" into a search engine and not be inundated with reasons the MAGI gang bill didn't make a lick of sense.</p>

<p>And not because the law might be used to profile African Americans and Hispanics, send them to prison longer if you can attach them to one or another gang, and then take away their voting rights forever. Yes, that is a real danger in today's world. We all know it, especially the folks who are salivating to disenfranchise black voters. We can stipulate this danger even without The Clarion-Ledger reporter's transparent asides about the Black Caucus being the big opponent of the gang bill.</p>

<p>The other, and arguably larger reason, to oppose the gang bill is that it would not do what such a law promises to do: reduce violence and serious crime over time. The crime experts would tell that reporter repeatedly should she bother to ask that policing gang activity is dumb and counter-productive. You should attack the violence and the people committing it, which most of them predict is 10 percent or less of the people who claim some sort of gang association, which is often a way of belonging to something bigger than yourself. (Which contains hints, by the way, of other ways to prevent violence and crime.)</p>

<p>I was just in New York City for 10 days to attend a crime-reporting symposium at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice where I have an investigative reporting fellowship (in conjunction with the Quattrone Center at Penn Law). The purpose is to give reporters tools to help know what and who to ask about crime and violence, and they connected us with everyone from the district attorneys of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Houston, Texas, to opioid experts (and a former addict) in Ohio, to the top criminologists and crime researchers in the country, to Koch Industries reps for prison and re-entry reform.</p>

<p>We'll be reporting on what I learned there over time, but suffice it to say that not one of them expressed the need to police and punish gang association and pile on additional sentences. The opposite, in fact. They know such "general" efforts are counter-productive and that most cities have moved to smarter, "focused" strategies.</p>

<p>One of the best-known strategies is headed by David Kennedy, a John Jay professor of criminal justice and the director of the National Network for Safe Communities, which helps set up and run programs often called "Operation Ceasefire" in cities around the country; some of their most recent work is in Birmingham, Ala. In fact, one of the primary strategies the 2016 BOTEC Analysis study of Jackson gang crime—funded by the Legislature and ignored by the Ledger—embraced was what is often called "the Kennedy model," which grew out of the successful Boston Gun Project of the 1990s, which he helped establish.</p>

<p>Put simply, Kennedy knows gang and gun violence, but doesn't use the word "gang" much. "'Gang' is an antiquated and useless concept," he told me in his office last week. He criticized the "world of gang enforcement" that fixates on policing gangs, instead of being smart and targeting the small percentage that commit the violence.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more solutions reporting on this front. If the gang bill stays dead as it should, we need to replace it with efforts that are more intelligent and evidence-based and not as likely to increase recidivism and create more violent gang members.</p>

<p>To be part of a local dialogue on such causes and solutions, join the Youth Media Project Thursday night, March 1, at Wingfield High School from 6 to 8 p.m., and again on Thursday, March 22, from 6 to 8 p.m. at Jim Hill High School. Their outcomes will soon be posted and regularly updated at jxnpulse.com.</p>

<h2 id="editorialjpdidentifycopswhoshootcivilians">EDITORIAL: JPD, Identify Cops Who Shoot Civilians</h2>

<p>Outside agencies should investigate if an officer used excessive force, and JPD must not withhold names, how long these officers have been with the force or if they have a record of using excessive force. Photo by</p>

<p>Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Lumumba touted his "progressive agenda" at a Feb. 27 press conference before signing an executive order to stop the release of mugshots of people the Jackson Police Department shoots.</p>

<p>Lumumba said JPD will stop releasing mugshots of juveniles, including those arrested as adults, a dangerous practice that can increase violence later and scar falsely accused kids. Even though his executive order did not include the juvenile mugshots, Lumumba said the ban would include those charged as adults, which is a major policy shift.</p>

<p>As recently as Feb. 16, the JPD sent reporters a mugshot of a 14-year-old girl charged with murder who was in custody when her photo went out.</p>

<p>This order does not address the glaring need for JPD to release names of officers who use excessive and/or fatal force on civilians—the progressive needle does not move without this transparent practice, which departments around the country embrace often within 48 or 72 hours of an incident.</p>

<p>Lumumba has been laissez-faire on the matter, saying he does not have a stance on releasing the names either way. After seven officer-involved shootings since Lumumba took office in July 2017, JPD has identified none of the shooters. Lumumba says his executive order should be an example for other municipalities and states to follow. But this is inconsistent.</p>

<p>The mayor introduced Interim Chief Anthony Moore as someone "familiar with the trends around the nation, as he teaches criminal justice. The chief said he would not identify officers who have shot civilians. That refusal ignores the U.S. Department of Justice's 2015 advisement for departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident.</p>

<p>Moore said it is about officers' safety, even as all departments face the same issue. The DOJ's report said police could take a couple of days extra if needed to ensure an officer was protected, but not several weeks or months. Moore also said it was a personnel issue, to which we heard someone respond, "An officer shooting is not an HR issue."</p>

<p>Now, JPD investigates officer-involved shootings internally and keeps the names private indefinitely if they ever become public knowledge. It feels like a cover-up even if it is not meant to be one. Outside agencies should investigate if an officer used excessive force, and JPD must not withhold names, how long these officers have been with the force or if they have a record of using excessive force.</p>

<p>The mayor's executive order loosely says that communities of color have always had complex relationships with law enforcement, but that national trends around violence and police-involved shootings do not necessarily reflect reality in Jackson with its majority-black police force.</p>

<p>Let us be clear: Race does not give Jackson license to withhold vital information from the public. Doing so will only increase distrust and perhaps bad policing, regardless of the City's demographics. The City must release the names immediately.</p>

<p>In Jackson, police violence is not deja vu; it is real and systemic.</p>

<p>On Feb. 21, 2018, a black male whom the Jackson Police Department or media have yet to identify was the latest victim of police violence since Nov. 15, 2017. Since then, local media outlets have reported seven officer-involved shootings. (See comment below this article.)</p>

<p>Although WLBT reported that the most recent one was the second officer-involved shooting in 2018, there actually have been three of these this year. JPD shot at Reginald Harper on Jan. 4, 2018. Fortunately, he was not maimed or killed. JPD officers fired a fusillade of bullets at Crystaline Barnes and killed her on Jan. 27, 2018. The most recent incident of police violence indicated that the man officers shot is in critical condition and is fighting for his life.</p>

<p>JPD told WLBT that officers were in the area investigating alleged drug activity when they approached two men, who ran from them. At some point, one of them allegedly produced a gun and fired at officers, which resulted in him being shot.</p>

<p>The officers were not in uniform. There is no clear indication that they identified themselves. No drugs were found at the scene. It appears that JPD officers were wrong about the victim being a drug dealer, which means they had no legal right to approach the men.</p>

<p>Standing on the corner does not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion that warrants an officer approaching a person to question them. It certainly does not mean that a person is a drug dealer.</p>

<p>Some will say, "If he was not doing anything wrong, why did he run?" The man's fleeing could be an indication that he was afraid. When the persons chasing him did not abandon their chase, he might have felt he had to defend himself.</p>

<p>Even if the officers did identify themselves, in a case where a gun-possession conviction of a black male was overturned, the Massachusetts Supreme Court held: "We do not eliminate flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop. However, in such circumstances, flight is not necessarily probative of a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt. Rather, the finding that black males are disproportionately and repeatedly targeted for FIO (Field Interrogation and Observation) encounters suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt."</p>

<p>Basically, the Massachusetts Supreme Court overturned the man's conviction because, given how much police stop and harass black men, the court found that the man had every reason to run, and running from officers alone is not enough to establish the necessary suspicion for them to conduct a field interrogation. The eight shootings in the span of three months here is important context that must be applied to this particular incident. Given this context, the victim had every reason to believe he could be in danger even if he knew the persons chasing him were police officers.</p>

<p>In Mississippi, the Massachusetts Supreme Court's ruling only has persuasive authority and is not binding. Nonetheless, it should be, and it is still instructive because black people throughout the United States are subject to the same human rights violations by police.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of this shooting, like with others, the officers-involved identities have not been disclosed to the public. They have been given a paid vacation while their colleagues investigate their actions. This is detestable and unacceptable. The Lumumba administration is complicit in these instances of police violence by virtue of its deafening silence on the issue. The residents of Jackson must hold both JPD's and the Lumumba administration's feet to the fire with respect to what is clearly a pattern of human-rights abuses.</p>

<p>The people must demand that the identities of the officers in this most recent shooting, as well as others, are disclosed. The officers involved should be fired immediately, or at the very least, residents of Jackson should not continue to pay them for exacting violence and brutality under the color of law. The Lumumba administration should order an external audit of JPD's policies and procedures, including but not limited to, its use-of-force policy.</p>

<p>The Jackson community should be integrally involved in the reshaping of the department's policies and procedures because we are subject to them.</p>

<p>The urns weren't memorials. They were storage. They were the remains family members did not wish to acknowledge. They were the ashes of dying men who returned to Mississippi to live out their lives, only to discover their families would not permit anyone living with AIDS, even kinfolk, into their homes.</p>

<p>The sick came from New York, Los Angeles and Dallas, the larger urban centers where the scourge first took hold. Prejudice drove relatives to close their doors. Landlords and neighborhood associations did the same, denying residency to those struck with the enigmatic incipient disease called AIDS.</p>

<p>The Sandifer House, named after the late civil- and gay-rights advocate Eddie Sandifer, rose from this environment. Opening in 1987, the Sandifer House on Jefferson Street offered men and women living with the disease respite from the continuing stigma of being HIV-positive in the early years of the AIDS crisis.</p>

<p>It was at the Sandifer House where Jackson's gay community provided services to their own—filling needs larger societal institutions like government, hospital and family failed to address.</p>

<p>From Robbery to Vigils</p>

<p>"We all figured HIV would come to Jackson eventually," the late Eddie Sandifer said from a rocking chair in his one-story south Jackson home in 2016. For six decades, the brazen activist donated his energy to civil-rights activism, conventional and not. Sandifer even robbed jewelry stores in the 1960s to help fund civil-rights organizations, earning himself time in Parchman for the crimes.</p>

<p>"My radicalism has gotten me in a lot more trouble than my being gay," he said. Sandifer formed the now-defunct Jackson branch of the Gray Panthers advocacy group for senior citizens and often married same-sex couples in unofficial ceremonies throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Providing direct services to those in need was his specialty, one Sandifer honed as a nursing-home administrator for 20 years. He also became the director of the Mississippi Gay and Lesbian Alliance in 1974.</p>

<p>When the weekly gay-interest publication from the alliance, This Month in Mississippi, mentioned expanding cases of the new and fatal HTLV-3 virus killing off young men-having-sex-with-men, often called MSM, in New York and San Francisco, Sandifer knew Jackson had to be prepared. The 1980s continued an era of free love in the gay community, where promiscuity represented pride in who they were. If the disease did in fact spread through sex, it did so quickly. Those native Mississippians who contracted HIV elsewhere would return home to live out the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>"At least for a particular amount of time, people felt more protected in the smaller cities of the South," Dr. Jeffrey Kelly, a clinical psychologist and one of the first doctors to treat AIDS cases in Mississippi, said, "but it obviously wasn't true."</p>

<p>Kelly was on staff at the University of Mississippi Medical Center when the first known HIV-positive patient arrived in Mississippi. That patient survived only a few days, but by 1985, more Mississippi natives living with HIV were returning and finding themselves without a home here.</p>

<p>"There was paranoia and hysteria around HIV then and not many effective community responses were happening outside of the gay community here," Kelly said. Families shunned those infected, the government was silent, and at the time, UMMC was weary of becoming known as "the AIDS hospital," he said.</p>

<p>"I think the gay community realized they had to provide their own answer."</p>

<p>The first line of Sandifer House's mission statement promises "to provide a group home for the support and care of persons living with AIDS that have no other appropriate housing options."</p>

<p>MGLA rented a large white Belhaven Heights home around 1986 with help from private donors like Levi Strauss Co., which operates a factory in Canton. Sandifer's partner of more than 30 years, Steven Ray, who is known as Chris, said they even received donations and support from some City and State leaders. Twelve people occupied the house at a given time. They shared rooms, and when one resident passed, another filled the vacancy quickly.</p>

<p>The residents were young, 20s and 30s (some older), and mostly men. Many first encountered Sandifer as his car ambled up their driveway to provide transportation to UMMC or other facilities for testing or to the Sandifer House for long-term housing. The pick-ups occurred in the discrete dark of night, so as to not tip off family members and neighbors to any association with the stigmatized illness.</p>

<p>"The neighbors threatened to burn down one person's home south of Meridian when they found out he was positive," Sandifer said.</p>

<p>By day, he worked at a desk near the house's front entrance while the gaunt residents passed time playing cards, watching television and cooking.</p>

<p>"They were close. They became family, most of them," Sandifer said.</p>

<p>When a resident's condition grew dire, it was up to him and the other residents, those well enough to assist, to tend to them. They picked up medication, cleaned up diarrhea, called ambulances. Ray estimates that it cost $5,000 a month to operate the house, a constant expense that the local gay community helped cover. He says the house required ongoing maintenance—he recalls doing plumbing work in the dead of winter. At Jack and Jill's Tavern (now closed), owner Jack Myers charged an extra cover for years, with all proceeds going to MGLA.</p>

<p>The gay bars were the communal gathering spaces for a grieving community. Jack and Jill's main room held cigarette-lighter vigils almost every week. It was difficult to find anyone in the gay community whose inner circle was not affected by AIDS back then.</p>

<p>"I lost a lot of friends," Myers said. Jack and Jill's donated $15,000 to the Sandifer House from 1985 until 1992, without which Sandifer said the house could not have functioned. No government agency at the local, state or national level provided funding.</p>

<p>'Not All Gloom and Doom'</p>

<p>MGLA provided meals and maintenance, though local churches and other groups such as Wells United Methodist Church would serve or bring meals. Priscilla Pearson was both a Wells Methodist volunteer and a neighbor in Belhaven Heights.</p>

<p>"Everyone referred to it as 'The AIDS House,'" Pearson said. "Inside was kind of a hushed setting. A sense of grave illness was present."</p>

<p>A dead man was lying on the sofa one night when Kelly was called to the Sandifer House. The resident had passed away earlier in the evening. Shaken residents sought out Kelly to come by for counseling.</p>

<p>"Not having spiritual support, social support, having to hide who you are, these are pretty bad for all people's well being, no matter what," Kelly told the Jackson Free Press. The belief that death was inevitable for those living with AIDS in that era gnawed at many Sandifer residents.</p>

<p>Kelly said what residents really needed that night was a minister, not a psychologist.</p>

<p>On assignment from The Clarion-Ledger, then-reporter Leesha Faulkner moved into the Sandifer House for two weeks in 1991 as part of a series titled "Living with AIDS." She played cards with the residents and read William Faulkner's "The Bear" with another.</p>

<p>Faulkner remembered some guys applying make-up and going out downtown at night. She and the residents joked about the police officers who hastily backed away from an approaching resident and the petrified patrons at the farmers market who feared AIDS could be transferred from a breath or a touch. Some people would even cross the sidewalk when they saw them coming.</p>

<p>"There were funny moments, not all doom and gloom," Faulkner said in an interview. "But there was a pall over the house. The illness did that."</p>

<p>One night, Faulkner was deep into a card game with a couple of other residents when a low moan resonated through the walls. The card game continued into the night, as did the moaning. It was coming from a dying resident in an adjacent room. The players did their best to ignore the helpless agony.</p>

<p>"What struck me then was that each resident was hearing his future that night. That still sticks with me to this day," Faulkner said.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the Sandifer House, Faulkner's then-husband made her get tested for HIV, not allowing her to live at home until she did so. Faulkner stayed in an apartment until the test results ultimately came back negative. Like the subjects of her reporting, the stigma surrounding HIV prevented her from going home.</p>

<p>Faulkner's Sandifer House articles, around a dozen, ran in The Clarion-Ledger in early March 1991. Within two weeks after the series was published, she says, each resident she lived with had died.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for Eddie, I don't know where they could have gone," Faulkner, who now works as communications director for the City of Tupelo, said.</p>

<p>Vivid in Faulkner's memories is the anxiety other Belhaven Heights residents showed toward the house and its occupants then.</p>

<p>"People would always walk on the other side of the house," she said. "They treated the residents with disdain."</p>

<p>Sandifer recalls a neighbor across the street who would report the license-plate numbers of visiting doctors and nurses to the Mississippi Department of Health until the doctors and nurses stopped coming by.</p>

<p>"Many still thought it was a contagious disease, that a wave could pass it," Sandifer said. "The residents were the new lepers."</p>

<p>Pearson believes it was economic fear that drove the neighborhood to oppose the house. "'Not by our house' was the mentality," Pearson said. "It wasn't that they had no sense of the illness. People wanted to protect their investment."</p>

<p>From the moment the Sandifer House opened, the Belhaven Heights Conservation Association fought to have it closed. Margaret Moize, the association president, petitioned the City of Jackson to shut it down, the Associated Press reported at the time.</p>

<p>A Jackson Daily News story from the late 1980s says Moize contended that the Sandifer House should be classified as a hospice, which would require approval from the Mississippi State Board of Health to operate. But MGLA opened the Sandifer House as a boarding home, which required no State approval. Eventually, the Jackson City Council ruled against the neighborhood association, and the Sandifer House continued operating as a boarding home.</p>

<p>Then-Mayor Dale Danks Jr. could have vetoed the council ruling, but in a lengthy statement, the three-term Democrat wrote that treating the Sandifer House any differently from similar personal-care homes in the Jackson "would constitute a violation of equal protection of the law." The neighborhood association appealed the ruling to the Hinds County Circuit Court, but the "boarding home" label for the Sandifer House remained in place.</p>

<p>By the early 1990s, the infrastructure of the house was in dire need of upkeep. A financial shortfall kept the sunken floorboards from repair, with the sole working bathroom descending lower and lower. A fetid smell took hold in the house, and rodents scurrying by became a prevalent sight. Occupancy was halved to six residents, and Sandifer's fundraising efforts could not relieve the budget strain.</p>

<p>In October 1992, MGLA elected to close down the Sandifer House. Sandifer and the organization did their best to find housing for the last residents. Ray provided shelter to the last three people after the house closed.</p>

<p>Sandifer Returns Home</p>

<p>The roads of Belhaven Heights are smoother now than they were a quarter-century ago. The azure summer sky had yet to fade as Eddie Sandifer delicately exited the car in front of the Jefferson Street house in August 2015. Helped by his walker and wearing white tennis shoes, gray sweatpants and a white charity T-shirt, the 86-year-old headed toward the old Sandifer House for the first time since the last resident packed up in 1992. The Belhaven Heights Neighborhood Association raised no objections. Residents did not report any license-plate numbers.</p>

<p>The current occupants of the old Sandifer House, Kim and Dale Gibson, greeted Sandifer at the door. The husband and wife are familiar with the home's history, but until recently were unaware the its former namesake was still living. Sandifer traced its history through the hallways.</p>

<p>"My office was right over there," Sandifer said. He walked by the mantel where the urns had sat. He walked past what was the dining room where Leesha Faulkner played cards and Kelly counseled the dying residents late into the night.</p>

<p>"Being back is really nice. I was well pleased with the house," he said.</p>

<p>A white Delta baggage label was around the handle of Sandifer's walker. He had recently returned from panels in Washington, D.C., and New York City, where he spoke of his jewelry-store escapades during the civil-rights era. These speaking events were rare for Sandifer in the years before his death. Although he kept abreast of the latest developments surrounding HIV advocacy in Mississippi, his activism years were behind him. He spent his final days mostly at home, in his bedroom, watching the news from the rocking chair as his black lab, B.B. Ray, interrogated every shoe in the room.</p>

<p>Sandifer's cremated remains now sit in his former south Jackson home. The capital city where his other house once gave shelter to the desperate is still dealing with a housing battle that has been waging for three decades and counting.</p>

<p>While medical advances have stopped AIDS from being a death sentence, the overlap of the disease and homelessness among the LGBT population in Jackson persists. The Mississippi Department of Health data show that Hinds County had 96 reported HIV cases in 2016, with 424 statewide. Jackson is one of the epicenters of the nation's HIV epidemic. AIDSVu estimates that 2,797 Jacksonians are living with HIV, the majority of them black men.</p>

<p>Grace House, which opened its doors in 1995, three years after the Sandifer House closed, is one of three local organizations specifically designed to serve the housing needs of Jacksonians living with HIV.</p>

<p>"Both AIDS and homelessness are at epidemic numbers," Catherine Sullivan, executive director of Grace House, said in February 2018. "It's abysmal."</p>

<p>An influx of federal grants from the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program is allowing Grace House to expand the number of beds it can offer to 600 to 800 a year. Still, Sullivan says that the path to lowering homelessness rates is through erasing the lingering stigma tied to the disease, along with reasons such as creating equal access to care.</p>

<p>"Stigma is huge," Sullivan said. "(With) the African American community in the Bible Belt, the stigma is glaring. Even the LGBT community can stigmatize HIV and AIDS. It is stigma on top of stigma on top of stigma."</p>

<p>Rovoskie Mays, who is HIV-positive and working toward an associate degree in nursing, has experienced this stigma firsthand. He found out he has the disease in October 2015. On a recommendation from his UMMC doctor, a skeptical Mays entered the Grace House. In addition to a warm bed, Mays, 22, receives food, schooling and medicine from the place he now calls "life-saving beyond measures."</p>

<p>"Grace House helps people remember that they're still human," he said. "There I learned to be brave, to have peace, and be proud of who I am."</p>

<p>Both Grace House and Mays are inextricably linked to the same community and struggle Sandifer fought to assist many years ago. The struggle endures, but with adequate funding and effective medicine, the potential to curb homelessness among Jacksonians living with AIDS is greater than ever before, even if the stigma sadly remains.</p>

<h2 id="numberofjpdofficerinvolvedshootingskeepsgrowing">Number of JPD Officer-Involved Shootings Keeps Growing</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Police say five officer-involved shootings have occurred since Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba took office in July 2017. The Jackson Free Press counts seven in that timeframe as of March 1. Lumumba is pictured here alongside Interim Jackson Police Chief Anthony Moore at a press conference on Jan. 19, 2018. Photo by</p>

<p>Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — With two deadly officer-involved shootings in the first two months of 2018, public scrutiny has grown over the Jackson Police Department's use-of-force policy and its decision to withhold officers' names until they complete an internal investigation, a criminal investigation and a Hinds County grand jury returns an indictment—a process that can take at least a year. This Mississippi Burueau of Investigations now handles these cases as well.</p>

<p>The mayor created an officer-identification task force to develop City policy around how JPD will deal with the release of officers' names and the time frame in which that takes palce.</p>

<p>In the meantime, individual officers who shoot civilians are not held accountable to the public despite citizens' tax-dollars funding salaries for them on paid leave following these incidents. The lack of transparency has also translated into varying reports on the sheer number of times JPD officers have shot at civilians.</p>

<p>Police told the Jackson Free Press Wednesday, Feb. 28 that there had been five officer-involved shootings since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba took office in July 2017. The Jackson Free Press counted seven in that timeframe and eight total officer-involved shootings to date under mayor Lumumba based on press briefings, local media reports and the JPD Twitter feed.</p>

<p>This post will be updated regularly to reflect any newly found information, including the names of officers involved, should they become available.</p>

<p>May 2018 </p>

<p>Elliot Reed, 30 (deceased) and Chauncy Reed, 26 </p>

<p>In a statement, JPD said police responded to a shooting involving an officer that occurred in the 900 block of Cooper Road at the Valero.</p>

<p>JPD said shortly after 1:00am this morning (Wednesday, May 9), an officer encountered the driver and passenger of a white SUV following a traffic stop.</p>

<p>"Following that encounter, shots were fired, from both the suspects and the officer," a statement reads.</p>

<p>One suspect, Elliot Reed, was critically injured and transported to a local hospital and he later died. The second, 26-year-old Chauncy Reed, was taken into custody at the scene. The officer did not suffer any serious injuries during the incident.</p>

<p>Chauncy Reed has been charged with Aggravated Assault on a Police Officer and Capital Murder.</p>

<p>The officer's name has not been released.</p>

<p>This investigation is being conducted by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>February 2018</p>

<p>Lee Edward Bonner, 37</p>

<p>Bonner died as a result of an officer-involved shooting that took place on Feb. 21 on the 1300 block of Deer Park Street at about 3 p.m. A narcotics investigation resulted in an alleged shootout. Officers pursued two men originally, but they lost sight of one in a wooded area behind an abandoned house, police said.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said narcotics officers noticed the second individual, Bonner, displayed a weapon, and that there was a shot and officers returned fire. Bonner later died as a result of his injuries.</p>

<p>At the scene, Holmes did not reveal if officers uncovered narcotics. He also said officers were not in standard police uniform because they were detectives.</p>

<p>The two officers involved are on paid administrative leave pending investigation, and their identities have not been released.</p>

<p>January 2018</p>

<p>Crystalline Barnes, 21</p>

<p>Barnes died on Jan. 27 after an early-morning traffic stop in response to a report that she may have forced another motorist off the roadway.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department spokesman Roderick Holmes said the officer that made the stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said in a statement.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," the statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect (sic) vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Then Holmes said Barnes drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>JPD did not confirm whether Barnes died of a gunshot or from the collision soon afterward, saying only that she was "fatally wounded." JPD implied that the deceased young woman may have a criminal history—they released what looked like a mugshot in the accompanying press releases to media. Mayor Lumumba signed an executive order on Feb. 26 to stop JPD from disseminating mugshots of those shot by police.</p>

<p>Both officers are on administrative leave with pay as the internal and criminal investigation unfold. Police have not released their identities.</p>

<p>Reginald Harper, 26</p>

<p>On Jan. 4 police shot at Harper on the 3100 block of Terry Road near the Sunshine Food Mart . An off-duty officer was at the Popeye's nearby when staff told him there was a black man inside being unruly and disruptive. The officer located him near Sunshine and called for backup.</p>

<p>"The suspect could be heard verbally threatening to do harm to the officers," Holmes wrote in a statement to media. Holmes said the suspect, Harper, retrieved "what appeared to be a silver handgun from his waistband and pointed the weapon at officers."</p>

<p>An officer discharged his weapon twice before Harper fled. A vehicle in the area got hit in the crossfire, but no one was hurt.</p>

<p>On Jan. 6 Harper was found and arrested for attempted aggravated assault on a police officer. It is unclear the type of injuries, if any, he sustained in the incident. It is also unknown who the officers in the incident were, or whether or not they are on paid leave.</p>

<p>November 2017</p>

<p>Matthew Tate, 20, and Christopher Harvey, 24</p>

<p>On Nov. 24, 2017, JPD reported an incident that took place at a traffic stop on the 3000 block of Bienville Drive. Shortly after 3 a.m., police said as an officer approached the vehicle, the passenger "was exhibiting suspicious behavior" and later produced a handgun that he pointed at the officer.</p>

<p>The officer, who was not injured, fired shots at the car before it sped away. When police found Tate, the alleged shooter, walking in south Jackson, he appeared to have sustained a head injury.</p>

<p>Harvey, the driver, and Tate were both charged with aggravated assault on a police officer.</p>

<p>The identity of the officer and whether or not he or she is on paid leave is unknown.</p>

<p>Unidentified man with knife</p>

<p>In the first of two officer-involved shootings on Nov. 15, 2017, a female officer shot and killed a man who allegedly approached her with a 6-inch knife at about 5 p.m. She fired at least one shot into the man's chest.</p>

<p>The incident apparently happened on Mayes Street near Lampton Avenue.</p>

<p>The man, whose name has not been released to the public, died as a result of the shooting. The unnamed officer was not injured, and she was placed on administrative leave with pay.</p>

<p>Unidentified black male, 23</p>

<p>In the second officer-involved shooting on Nov. 15, 2017, a black man was shot in the leg in the Presidential Hills subdivision. Police say he did not stop at an administrative checkpoint. Officers further down the road apparently approached his vehicle, and he hit the gas, almost hitting them.</p>

<p>The man eventually stopped the car once he ended up driving into someone's yard a couple of streets over. Officers pursued him on foot, and when they found him in someone's backyard, they saw a black object in his hand that they believed to be a weapon. Despite verbal commands to drop it, police said the suspect ran and turned to point the black object at officers after which officers heard a shot. One officer returned fire, hitting the man in the leg. He apparently tried to continue running, but stopped because of his injuries.</p>

<p>Holmes said the suspect would be charged with aggravated assault on a police officer. It is unclear if police recovered the black object the suspect had in his hand, though Holmes said they found a gun in his car.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the officer who fired the shot was put on administrative leave with pay, nor has JPD released his or her name.</p>

<p>On Oct. 27, 2017, JPD tweeted that police were on the scene of an officer-involved shooting at Memphis Street and Fontaine Avenue, where a black male was shot, but was in stable condition.</p>

<p>Local media reported that a 23-year-old man broke away from a group officers had approached. He started to run, and officers said he pulled out a gun. The police fired, striking the fleeing man in the side and back.</p>

<p>The officers were not injured, and two were placed on administrative leave with pay. Their names have not been released.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Attorney General Jim Hood will challenge the Federal Communications Commission's decision earlier this year to repeal net neutrality regulations.</p>

<p>The regulations, imposed during President Barack Obama's administration, ensure that Internet service providers do not speed up or slow down certain services or sites based on rivalries or company affiliations.</p>

<p>In December 2017, the FCC voted to dismantle net neutrality regulations, and the FCC published the final rule on the decision Feb. 22.</p>

<p>"(T)he Federal Communications Commission returns to the light-touch regulatory scheme that enabled the internet to develop and thrive for nearly two decades," the final rule says. "The Commission restores the classification of broadband internet access service as a lightly-regulated information service and reinstates the private mobile service classification of mobile broadband internet access service."</p>

<p>The new approach is set to take affect on April 23.</p>

<p>Hood joins 22 attorneys general who filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>"The repeal of net neutrality would have dire consequences for consumers and businesses in Mississippi and across the country who rely on and have a right to a free and open internet," Hood said in a press release. "A repeal would allow internet service providers to control and slow down consumers' lawful internet activity, which is unfair and un-American."</p>

<p>The attorneys general will argue that the rollback of net neutrality regulations violate federal law, including the Constitution and Communications Act of 1934. Hood lists several concerns with the rollback in a press release, including that the rule improperly and unlawfully includes sweeping preemption of state and local laws.</p>

<p>Most Republicans seem to be on board with the proposal, including Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who released a joint statement last year when FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced his rollback plan.</p>

<p>"We have long said that imposing a Depression-era, utility-style regulatory structure onto the internet was the wrong approach, and we applaud Chairman Pai's efforts to roll back these misguided regulations. Consumers want an open internet that doesn't discriminate on content, and protects free speech and consumer privacy," Wicker said in a joint statement with other senators. "It's now time for Republicans and Democrats, internet service providers, edge providers, and the internet community as a whole to come together and work toward a legislative solution that benefits consumers and the future of the internet."</p>

<p>Pai believes the move will stop federal government from micromanaging the Internet, the AP reported.</p>

<p>William H. Kelly III.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Two unnamed male officers with the Jackson Police Department came into contact with two men at the 1300 block of Deer Park Street at about 3 p.m. Wednesday. A narcotics investigation resulted in an alleged shootout between officers and a man who's name has not yet been released.</p>

<p>JPD spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said the two men immediately took off running from officers, inciting a foot chase where one of the men got away—officers have not identified or located him.</p>

<p>"One individual, they lost sight of him in a wooded area behind an abandoned house," Holmes told the media on Wednesday. "The second individual actually ran between the wooded area and the house. They later came in contact with him in the front of that location."</p>

<p>Holmes said narcotics officers noticed the second individual displayed a weapon and that there was a shot and officers returned fire.</p>

<p>"They gave him several commands to drop the weapon," Holmes said Wednesday. "He refused to comply. He fired a shot at the officers, at least one shot that we know of, and the officers then returned fire."</p>

<p>Police say the man was struck at least two times and is in critical condition at an area hospital. The weapon was recovered for evidence and identified as a stolen weapon. The suspect, whose identity is not yet released, is a convicted felon, police say, but did not provide details.</p>

<p>Ophelia Catchings, the aunt of the man who was shot, said on the scene that she does not know what happened. Catchings heard gunshots and received a call from other family members and said that she immediately threw on clothes and drove to the scene.</p>

<p>At the scene, Holmes did not reveal if officers uncovered narcotics. He also said officers were not in standard police uniform because they are detectives.</p>

<p>Holmes said JPD's standard procedure is to place officers on administrative leave pending an internal investigation and a criminal investigation to determine if any laws had been broken. Their names may be released later in the investigation, he said, but that is at JPD's discretion.</p>

<p>"When we have an internal investigation like that, it's just standard that we don't release the names until we obviously get to a certain point, and at that point we determine whether or not we release those names," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>This marks the second JPD officer-involved shooting this year.</p>

<p>Early on Jan. 27, two Jackson police officers shot at 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes during a traffic stop in response to a report that Barnes may have forced another motorist off the roadway.</p>

<p>Holmes said the officer that made the stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said in a statement the same day as the incident.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," the statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect's (sic) vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Then Holmes said Barnes drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>JPD has been very tight-lipped in not releasing the names of the officers nor did they confirm whether Barnes died of a gunshot or from the collision soon afterward, saying only that she was "fatally wounded."</p>

<p>In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice advised police departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident.</p>

<p>More information is to come when received.</p>

<p>STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) — Leaders of a Mississippi college town have denied a request to host the city's first gay pride parade, a decision that left some members of the group in tears and drew criticism from the mayor.</p>

<p>Starkville Pride, an LGBT support group, had planned to hold the parade March 24 in Starkville.</p>

<p>But Starkville aldermen on Tuesday voted 4-3 against the permit. Three of the aldermen who voted to reject it left the meeting room through a back entrance, and none of the alderman who voted no voiced their opinions at the meeting, The Dispatch reported .</p>

<p>Sixteen people had spoken in favor of having the gay pride parade, and two had spoken against it, The Starkville Daily News reported .</p>

<p>Resident Dorothy Isaac said she was against the parade because "God created Adam and Eve."</p>

<p>"Do not turn our city into a sin city," Isaac said. "It should not be this."</p>

<p>Resident Kevin Williams, who spoke in favor of the parade, said this was a time for the city to be on the right side of history. Many years ago, African-American people would have been denied the same type of request, he said.</p>

<p>Starkville Mayor Lynn Spruill said she was disappointed with the decision.</p>

<p>The town is home to Mississippi State University. Spruill noted that Oxford, Mississippi, where the University of Mississippi is based, has held gay pride parades for several years.</p>

<p>"I think it sends a message that we are not the inclusive community that I believe us to be," the mayor said of the decision.</p>

<p>Alderman Jason Walker, who voted in support of the parade, said he was disappointed that his colleagues who voted no have given no explanation for their decision.</p>

<p>"It's unfortunate that you go through the process, you do everything you're supposed to do and you get denied, really without any explanation as to why," Walker said.</p>

<h2 id="gangbillcouldincreaseprisoncostsdisparatelyaffectafricanamericans">Gang Bill Could Increase Prison Costs, Disparately Affect African Americans</h2>

<p>Corey Wiggins, executive director of the Mississippi NAACP (pictured here at a different press conference), said his organization opposes Senate Bill 2868 because of its potential to negatively affect communities of color in the state. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Proposed legislation to crack down on gangs statewide could lead to increased prison costs, a move that would counteract the state's progress in decreasing the number of inmates—and taxpayer dollars used to incarcerate those inmates—since 2014.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 2868 would broaden the definition of a "gang" in state law as well as add an additional penalty and sentence for any crime proved to be "criminal gang activity," for a minimum of five years and up to 15 years in prison.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators and prosecutors in the state say they need the legislation to crack down on gang violence in the state, but Democrats in both the House and the Senate, as well as community organizations and anti-violence experts, have serious doubts about the measure.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Legislative Black Caucus held a hearing on the bill, with a couple of Republicans also in attendance. Lawmakers heard from lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the NAACP.</p>

<p>Corey Wiggins, executive director of the Mississippi NAACP chapter, said his organization opposes the expanded gang bill.</p>

<p>"We don't think that this legislation is something that is positive, particularly in our communities," Wiggins said. "And we are looking for something that specifically addresses criminal-justice reform in a real way that supports communities and creates opportunities for employment, creates opportunities for economic development."</p>

<p>Lawmakers also heard from the state public defender Andre de Gruy who had run numbers on the legislation. During debate, some legislators asked for a fiscal note on the bill, but so far Senate Bill 2868 does not have a fiscal note attached.</p>

<p>De Gruy estimates that one person sentenced to 15 years for gang-related activity under the proposed law would cost taxpayers more than $110,000 for each inmate. If the nearly 12,000 identified gang members in MDOC's custody were sentenced with the enhanced penalties in Senate Bill 2868, it would cost the state up to $1.35 billion in additional prison costs.</p>

<p>The 2017 Mississippi Gang Assessment estimates that about 62 percent of the prison population in the state identify as gang members. De Gruy, who serves on the state's Corrections and Criminal Justice Task Force, said the tie between violence and gang membership is not there in the limited data the state does have, however.</p>

<p>He told lawmakers Wednesday that the majority of inmates released from the Mississippi Department of Corrections have committed nonviolent crimes, including those identified as gang members coming back to the community.</p>

<p>"(Of) gang members and non-gang members, 72 percent have committed a nonviolent crime. Among gang members it was 79 percent, so the tie between gang membership and violent crime isn't apparent in the limited data we do have," he said.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Legislature passed House Bill 585 to reduce the costs of incarceration and loosen sentences for those accused of nonviolent crimes. De Gruy said crime rates in the state are actually declining since 2014.</p>

<p>"If gangs are driving crime and gang (activities) are going up, we would see the opposite. I don't think the data supports this because I don't think there's enough data, but it appears that gang involvement in Mississippi is going down," he said.</p>

<p>"... There's also no evidence that simply enhancing a sentence, or making a sentence longer, is going to affect the activity you're trying to target. There's no evidence that you're going to have less drug dealing because we have an enhanced statute."</p>

<p>De Gruy said that enhanced sentences disproportionately affect African Americans in the state, based on the research the task force did while implementing House Bill 585.</p>

<p>"When we looked at the population that is serving enhanced sentences in 2014, 80 percent were African American. ... So again, historically, enhancements are used disproportionately against African Americans."</p>

<p>A white gang, the Simon City Royals, however, is the third largest gang in the state, a state gang assessment using MAGI data states.</p>

<p>Other research backs up de Gruy's findings and shows that increasing penalties and more jail time does not decrease gang activity. Part of the $500,000 taxpayer-funded BOTEC analysis of the Jackson area focused on gang prevention in the state capital.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, the evidence is clear that solving a youth violence problem does not require defining gangs or counting their members. The ability to stop groups of young people from committing violent crimes is solved with unbiased examination of data, followed by a strategy that incorporates the lessons from other communities while accepting whatever unique features are a part of Jackson's problem," the BOTEC gang violence assessment says.</p>

<p>A full archive of the JFP's "Preventing Violence" series, supported by grants from the Solutions Journalism Network. Photo of Zeakyy Harrington by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>The BOTEC analysis lays out a strategic plan, with several phases, that communities in other parts of the country have taken to prevent gang violence. In Fresno, Calif., a group of pastors, former gang members, service providers and law enforcement officers began meeting monthly to shape a violence reduction strategy in order to combat gangs.</p>

<p>One of the lead researchers for the 2016 BOTEC reporter, Ron Noblet, told the Jackson Free Press that the gang bill is overly broad and that is unwise to focus on apprehending people associated with a gang rather than investigating violence crime.</p>

<p>Joy Hogge, the executive director of Families as Allies, addressed her concerns for kids and families whom the bill might endanger. "This bill has the potential to disproportionately affect youth of color," she said, noting that her organization gets lots of calls from families interacting with law enforcement.</p>

<p>"... If we look at those calls about an adolescent male being stopped by police, those who are African American are much more likely to experience harsher consequences than those who are white, that's just the reality, and this bill makes that even scarier for parents of young men who are African American."</p>

<p>The gang bill is in the House, and has yet to be assigned to a committee for consideration.</p>

<h2 id="reentryreformsstillaliveinlegislature">Re-Entry Reforms Still Alive in Legislature</h2>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi can begin to look at justice reinvestment, and it should be a priority, Andre de Gruy, the state public defender who is also on the state's Corrections and Criminal Justice Oversight Task Force, told the re-entry council earlier this month. In 2014, the Legislature passed a criminal-justice reform package that decreased the number of men and women incarcerated in the state. De Gruy said the idea behind reducing the number of people behind bars is to reinvest those funds in re-entry efforts.</p>

<p>"Those savings should be going into programs that will keep people out of prison, and that's sort of (why) the re-entry council came about to kind of come up with things we can spend that money on," he said.</p>

<p>While several criminal-justice reform bills are dead, lawmakers could still consider several measures that would positively affect re-entry opportunities for men and women returning from prison. The state's re-entry council met on Friday, Feb. 2, to go over some of their recommendations as well as review what legislation is still moving forward this session. One solution is to repurpose or use drug courts as re-entry courts, U.S. District Judge Keith Starrett, who sits on the re-entry council, stressed. These types of courts are common all over the country, specifically for people who leave prison with a substance-addiction problem, he said.</p>

<p>"You don't mix the high-risk offenders—the ones who are coming out of prison who score high on the risk assessment—with the low-risk offenders," he said on Feb. 2. "... They have to be separated."</p>

<p>Legislation to open drug courts to more offenders died in House and Senate committees this year, and de Gruy said the drug-court budget would have to be increased to make the recommendation a reality. Several re-entry bills are still alive in the Legislature that have a decent chance of becoming law, however. The Oversight Task Force 2017 report recommends that the Mississippi Department of Corrections develop parole case plans for all inmates, which is carrying out an initial recommendation from the 2015 criminal-justice reform package. De Gruy told the re-entry council on Feb. 2 that House Bill 1172 contained the changes needed for MDOC to keep up with the rapid intake of case plans. MDOC cannot keep up with the current time restrictions on case plans in state law.</p>

<p>"Basically, it's kind of like your progress report for kids in school. You work with them, tell them what programming they need based on these risk assessments. It's something that takes some work to get together, and then it takes work to monitor each offender who's eligible as they go through the process," he said.</p>

<p>De Gruy said about 1,700 inmates are eligible under the bill for parole, and need case plans. House Bill 1172 passed that chamber last week, and the Senate will need to pass the bill to give MDOC the flexibility to keep up with the demand. Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Jim Kitchens asked who gets a case plan.</p>

<p>"Any chance it could be backed up to cover people who are not new offenders?" Kitchens asked de Gruy earlier this month at the re-entry council meeting.</p>

<p>"Ideally, I think they should, and I would hope that if they get to the point where they could do that," de Gruy answered.</p>

<p>Currently, case plans are for inmates who were convicted after July 1, 2014.</p>

<p>The Senate could consider another bill that would provide income tax credits to those who hire previously incarcerated men and women. House Bill 175 provides $2,500 for four years each former prisoner is employed. De Gruy said even if the Legislature amends bill is amended, any income tax credit is better than none at all.</p>

<p>"You have to start somewhere..." he cautioned. "Anything it does is more than we have now."</p>

<p>Several re-entry council proposals that died last year are in House Bill 387, which the Senate Corrections Committee will have to take up. Other reforms from the re-entry council are in Senate Bill 2841, which was dramatically amended before the Senate passed it last week.</p>

<h2 id="decriminalizingpotinthecity">Decriminalizing Pot in the City</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Ward 4 Councilman De’Keither Stamps proposed decriminalizing simple possession of marijuana in Jackson to free up police resources to focus on other crimes and to reduce the number who go to jail for small amounts. Photo by</p>

<p>Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Jennifer Riley-Collins is a veteran of the U.S. Army, as well as the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi. She has been on both active and reserve duty for more than 30 years. At a Feb. 5 public hearing, she shared that her life would torpedo, and she would lose her hard-earned benefits if she were caught with even 30 grams or less of marijuana.</p>

<p>"If I were impacted by being arrested for simple possession of marijuana, I may lose my veterans benefits," Riley-Collins said. "I worked 32 years for them—that's not something I want to lose.</p>

<p>"Someone who went to war should not be forced to risk losing their veterans benefits because they were arrested for an ounce of marijuana."</p>

<p>Jackson has become the latest city in the nation to propose legislation to decriminalize marijuana possession of 30 grams or less within city limits. The Jackson City Council passed Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps' ordinance to free up police resources to focus on other crimes and to offer relief to those who are thrown into the criminal-justice system for personal-use possession on Feb. 13.</p>

<p>Decriminalizing simple possession within Jackson's limits is not a panacea—possessing marijuana will still be illegal. If you are caught outside the city limits or by anyone who is not a Jackson police officer, state and federal laws can make the result more complicated. That is especially true under U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p>

<p>'I Get It, Trust Me'</p>

<p>The new city ordinance says that those in possession of 30 grams of marijuana or less would pay a fine of no more than $100 and face no prison time. But, state law does not outline any jail time for the first time someone is caught with 30 grams of marijuana or less, rather a fine of $100 to $250. A second conviction for simple possession within two years yields a $250 fine, no more than 60 days in the county jail and mandatory enrollment in a drug-education program unless a court finds the sentence inappropriate. Any subsequent conviction within two years merits a fine between $250 and $1,000 and up to six months in county jail.</p>

<p>Stamps' ordinance says the Jackson Police Department may implement a mandatory training on how City ordinances differ with state law, but there are still gaps. What will happen to those charged more than once with simple possession? Will the $100 maximum fine apply to each conviction for simple possession? Ward 2 Councilman Melvin Priester Jr. spoke about the importance of nuance.</p>

<p>"Honestly, in my opinion, this is more of a political statement—it doesn't change the fact that this is still illegal at the state level," Priester said. "I have some real questions about what this practically means, though I support the political gesture."</p>

<p>Stamps did not outline what happens if someone is caught with 30 grams or less in a motor vehicle. State law says a driver with up to 30 grams of marijuana could face a maximum fine of $1,000, up to 90 days in county jail or both if convicted.</p>

<p>Local attorney Chuck Mullins doubts the City ordinance would stand up in court if the attorney general's office took issue.</p>

<p>"Forget about the marijuana," he told the Jackson Free Press on Feb. 5. "What if it was another law that is inconsistent or in conflict with state statute? It's the principle of the thing—you can't pass laws which are inconsistent with state laws."</p>

<p>Mullins suggests a standing order with city court judges saying that people will not go to jail for 30 grams or less regardless of how many convictions. Either way, he is sympathetic to the cause.</p>

<p>"I get it, trust me," Mullins said. "I get what they're trying to do. It makes sense because a lot of times you get folks out there, and they've got this personal possession, personal-use crime, and you know it's only going to be a fine, but you're going to have to take them down to the jail...."</p>

<p>State, Federal and Beyond</p>

<p>In 2014, Gov. Phil Bryant signed "Harper Grace's Law" to exempt certain uses of cannabidiol oil. The law also decriminalized marijuana for research purposes at the University of Mississippi. Attorney General Jim Hood recently spoke on C-SPAN's "Washington Journal" and addressed his views on marijuana as an "old, gray-haired drug warrior" and prosecutor.</p>

<p>"Eventually, our young people are going to change it—they're going to change the law in our state, probably legalize it, probably in my lifetime in the next 20 years," Hood said on Feb. 7.</p>

<p>Currently, at the federal level simple possession with no intent to distribute is punishable by up to one year in prison, a minimum fine of $1,000 or both. On Jan. 4, Sessions sent out a memo to all U.S. attorneys reversing President Barack Obama's policy of essentially non-interference at the federal level in states that passed decriminalization laws. Sessions also said recently that marijuana is a gateway drug to opioid addiction, which drug researchers dispute.</p>

<p>With differing, subjective statutes, it can be confusing to know where authorities stand. Atlanta is one recent example. Georgia state law prescribes imprisonment up to one year and a fine of up to $1,000 for possession of one ounce or less of marijuana. However, the Atlanta City Council voted in October 2017 to lower fines to $75 for marijuana possession up to an ounce and eliminate jail time.</p>

<p>"If you get arrested by anybody but a city cop, you're toast," Atlanta City Councilwoman Yolanda Adrean said in April 2017.</p>

<h2 id="neverbackdownmississippiescalateswarongangs">Never Back Down: Mississippi Escalates War on Gangs</h2>

<p id="date">date: 2018-02-14</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/feb/14/never-back-down-mississippi-escalates-war-gangs/ </p>

<p>The Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators, a nonprofit association of law enforcement officers and prosecutors, has this logo on their website. MAGI is pushing lawmakers to pass the expanded gang legislation this session. Photo courtesy msmagi.com</p>

<p>Four 16-year-olds are standing on a street corner in Richland, Miss., all wearing identical hoodies. One of them has a little more than 30 grams of marijuana on him. A police officer stops the young men, believing they are a gang because they're dressed alike, and finds the pot.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, the young man with the pot would face a possible three-year sentence under state law.</p>

<p>But the officer is not done. He takes all of them to jail, charging each with gang activity because they are dressed alike and have similar tattoos. That means each of them can go to prison for both the pot charge, plus an additional sentence of five to 15 years, if prosecutors can convince a jury they are part of a Mississippi gang.</p>

<p>The gang may not exactly be the Black Gangster Disciples, the Vice Lords or the Simon City Royals, the state's three biggest criminal street gangs. Maybe the four young men met at school, and they all needed money so they decided to sell pot. Maybe they've never lifted a finger against anyone else. Maybe it's their first pot sale.</p>

<p>Maybe their families do not or cannot do enough to keep them off the corner. Maybe one or both parents are already in prison for a drug charge and cannot provide for them. Maybe they or their parents, or both, are addicted to a substance. Maybe the boys call themselves something like "Rankin $$ Boyz 39073" for fun and bravado. Maybe they are future doctors, lawyers and legislators if they don't end up in prison for years because they were stupid enough to wear matching sweatshirts and not stay away from weed.</p>

<p>Either way, Mississippi law enforcement may soon be able to decide the boys are a gang even if they're not part of a larger criminal enterprise with a hierarchy and criminal connections beyond whomever they got the pot from. Under Mississippi's proposed gang-law expansion, Senate Bill 2868, police and prosecutors would have the flexibility to call them a "gang" and a decent shot of proving it in a court of law, and then require that the judge order consecutive sentencing. That could be another five, 10, 15 years for each of the boys on top of the three years for the pot charge.</p>

<p>The bill allows a judge to suspend a mandatory or enhanced punishment and impose alternative punishment "only in an unusual case where the interests of justice would be best served," and only if the judge enters the specific reasons into the court minutes.</p>

<p>Mississippi Sen. Derrick Simmons, a Democratic black lawmaker from Greenville, used a variation of that hypothetical on the Senate floor last week to challenge the gang bill and Sen. Brice Wiggins, its biggest cheerleader in the Legislature. Wiggins is a Republican from Pascagoula and a former prosecutor who has been pushing for an expanded gang law in recent years. He saw a similar law, which he added into a amendment to another bill, fail last session.</p>

<p>After Simmons presented the four-guys-in-a-hoodie scenario—without placing them in Rankin County, though—Simmons looked at Wiggins and asked, "You understand my concern?"</p>

<p>Wiggins equivocated in response. "Again, only if the elements are there, and it's proven for criminal gang activity. ... If it's just drugs, I would hope they wouldn't be charged if there's no probable cause for criminal gang activity," Wiggins said. "... I know what you're asking, but I don't think it works that way, to be quite honest."</p>

<p>"But there's nothing in the bill that would prohibit or stop law enforcement or a prosecutor from charging them," Simmons pointed out to Wiggins.</p>

<p>"No, but that's why they hire people like you or excellent criminal defense attorneys to get that addressed in a court of law," Wiggins responded, raising eyebrows among those present who know that not all young people on a street corner can afford the same defense attorneys that legislators might hire should they get in trouble.</p>

<p>The Discretion Conundrum</p>

<p>The ongoing problem of "discretion" and how much to give law enforcement and prosecutors is an age-old criminal-justice dilemma. On the one hand, discretion can allow a police officer not to arrest someone she does not believe is a hardened criminal. On the other, it can enable law enforcement to act on either implicit or explicit biases to punish certain young people—say those of a particular race—the officers do not like.</p>

<p>In today's America, it's not a secret that not all police officers are ethical—see the new corruption conviction of the Baltimore, Md., officers for planting evidence or the cops in Los Angeles who helped white supremacists, neither of which Mississippi has ever been immune to. It is also undeniable that the people caught up in bad policing are often powerless young men of color who are assumed to be criminals and who probably cannot afford those great attorneys Wiggins recommends.</p>

<p>The same bias could flow from black officers toward the white Simon City Royals, of course, but the Senate debate, and a previous one over the House's version of the gang bill, revealed that black lawmakers were far more likely to voice concerns about what overly broad police discretion can result in than even the white Democrats in the same room.</p>

<p>By Imani Khayyam</p>

<p>Sen. John Horhn, a black Jackson Democrat who pushed the Legislature to fund a $500,000 Botec Analysis study on crime in the capital city (which few other legislators seem to have read) challenged Wiggins' definition of what comprises a criminal group. He asked him if his bill would extend to corporate executives involved in a scandal similar to the WorldCom or Enron scams, and if they could qualify as a gang under the bill. Wiggins responded that he did not think so.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Horhn asked.</p>

<p>"Because that's not what the bill is aimed at. It's aiming at the criminals and the gangs that are in our communities," Wiggins said, skating past the fact that the WorldCom hustlers were right here in the Jackson metro, ripping off people they knew. "... We're talking about gangs. We could sit here and hypothetical all day long." He then added that a black House member had "said how bad the gangs were, so we're trying to solve an issue."</p>

<p>"It's not a Republican, Democrat(ic), black or white (issue)," Wiggins added.</p>

<p>Black legislators weren't buying it. "You mentioned the issue of people being preyed upon," Horhn said to Wiggins. "And in a lot of communities, not the Enron strata of communities but down to the poor, less powerful aspects of our communities, it's a matter of self-protection to join a gang. In the course of trying to survive their community, where there may be a gang presence, are we going to penalize those folks forced into gangs as a matter of self-protection?"</p>

<p>With that question, Horhn was drawing upon current criminal-justice research that shows that many young people of color actually carry weapons to protect themselves, just like many older white men, probably including legislators, in the state.</p>

<p>The "self-protection" question drew another virtual shrug from Wiggins, however. "No, I'm not concerned about that because this bill ..., if it becomes law, is aimed at those who are bringing youth into, and as I said, preying on our youth to join these gangs. No," he answered.</p>

<p>Except that the bill redefines "gang" as "an association of three or more persons whose members are involved in criminal gang activity"—who could be standing on the Richland corner selling that pot—"and who collectively identify themselves by adopting a group identity." That can be done in myriad ways: with a common name, slogan, sign, symbol, tattoo or other physical marking; style or color of clothing or hairstyle; a hand sign or gesture, or a finger position; or graffiti. The bill specifically exempts a sports team, a legal business or charity unless it was created as a "pretext for criminal gang activity," rather than becoming a criminal conspiracy like happened at Enron and WorldCom.</p>

<p>The logic is circular: Prosecutors could then use the expanded definition to widen the net to catch more gang members and then be able to charge more of them with criminal gang activity. So if one of the hoodie guys on the Richland corner commit a crime that is deemed "criminal gang activity," then all of them are automatically considered to be gang members if one of the shared elements is in place.</p>

<p>The bill does target coercing or encouraging another to commit a felony, but it also includes committing various other crimes, indicating that the bill is not only about "preying on our youth."</p>

<p>But Wiggins fell back to assuring the lawmakers that Mississippi police would not possibly apply the law unfairly .</p>

<p>"Profiling is wrong," he said. "The law enforcement I know don't do that. You always have a bad person here or there, and the law takes care of that, and I can assure you the folks I talked to about this bill, that is not what they want to do."</p>

<p>Ron Noblet, a lead investigator on the Legislature-funded 2016 BOTEC analysis study of Jackson gangs and crime, read the bill last week, as did his attorneys, and agreed with the black legislators that it gives police far too much discretion to make bad decisions. "It is either consciously or unconsciously written in a way that's extraordinarily broad," he said in a phone interview.</p>

<p>"We see it as just another pitiful way to keep people of color in prison, and to not deal with the fundamental problems that cause gangs in the first place," he added.</p>

<p>The gang bill, Noblet said, just focuses on more arrests rather than evidence-based solutions that can lower violence.</p>

<p>"If I say you're a gangster and that you're talking to gangsters, then you're a gangster. ... It is the standard way that law enforcement will try to deal with a problem that cannot be dealt with with force," said Noblet, who trains law enforcement around the country in effective gang intervention and consults with the Urban Peace Institute in Los Angeles, Calif.</p>

<p>Effective gang intervention is also not about cops playing warrior, or law enforcement being the only ones trying to stop violence. "Police should be there, part of the table. They should never be everyone at the table," Noblet warned.</p>

<p>'The Risk of Profiling'</p>

<p>The organization that is lobbying for SB 2868 and gathering evidence to support it has an intriguing logo—one that looks more like gang insignia than that of a collection of law enforcement, prosecutors and court officials from around the state. When you click to the website of the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators, called MAGI for short, you see a crudely drawn combat-green box with a white skull dripping with either paint or blood on top of two crossed AR-15-type rifles.</p>

<p>The site makes it clear that the goal of MAGI is to apprehend gang members and send them away to prison, preferably for a long time. Founded in 2008, the nonprofit association welcomes people associated with the criminal system "whose interest or primary investigative responsibilities include the identification and prosecution of crimes related to gang activity."</p>

<p>At its Nov. 5-8, 2017, state conference at the Golden Nugget in Biloxi—theme "Never Backing Down"—MAGI gave out questionnaires to 71 law-enforcement agencies around the state about what gangs and how many members they're identifying in their jurisdictions. The roster seems to be loosely defined to include any possible criminal group with a gang-esque name, no matter how large or small—from the Chicago-born Black Gangster Disciples to what they called "neighborhood cliques."</p>

<p>MAGI gave those responses to the federal Department of Homeland Security "fusion center" in Pearl, which published a Mississippi gang assessment in December. Now, SB 2868's backers are using that report to support the bill.</p>

<p>The report indicates that the Gangsters, the Vice Lords and the Simon City Royals—all gang brands that originated in Chicago decades ago—are the most prevalent gangs in the state and the ones involved in the most criminal activity, both inside and outside correctional facilities.</p>

<p>"The formation of hybrid gangs and neighborhood cliques has been the most notable trend," the assessment said. "These non-traditional gangs welcome merging of members from established gangs in order to unite over a specific territory."</p>

<p>It also recommended MAGI's "more inclusive gang bill ... to address the growing violent and organized gang activity." The report also makes it clear that the bill goes far beyond gangs recruiting youth.</p>

<p>"The draft bill creates the crime of criminal gang activity and addresses the problems associated with juvenile recruitment, youth gang members, the organized 'money men,' gang tactics and allows the use of a statewide Grand Jury." The grand jury is likely a way to prosecute alleged gang members outside jurisdictions that would likely be more skeptical, such as majority-black areas like Jackson or Greenville.</p>

<p>"(The new gang law) would further mandate statutory minimums for criminal gang activity and require the penalty for the crime to run consecutive to the underlying felony," the fusion center's assessment stated. That can mean long terms in prisons—with tough prison gangs—for anyone "associated" with a group that MAGI members decide to call a gang.</p>

<p>Sen. Barbara Blackmon, D-Canton, asked Wiggins on the Senate floor to tell her more about MAGI and his meetings with them. He said he went to one of their trainings on the Coast.</p>

<p>"Was it a diverse group?" Blackmon asked.</p>

<p>"Diverse in agencies?" Wiggins asked.</p>

<p>"No, diverse in hue."</p>

<p>"Hue? As in color? ... Yeah, as far as I can recall: white, black, everybody under the sun."</p>

<p>MAGI does have racial diversity in its ranks. And the gang assessment makes it clear that a white gang, the Simon City Royals, is one of the state's top challenges, especially on the Coast now. The organization even told The Clarion-Ledger that the most verified gang members in the state are now white.</p>

<p>Those facts do not negate the risk that such a broad law is still enforced harsher against people of color in neighborhoods considered crime-infested than it could be against white gang suspects, several violence experts told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"Using a white gang as the reason for harsh and expansive anti-gang policies is undoubtedly a way to neutralize claims related to racial bias and profiling," criminal law professor Babe Howell of the CUNY School of Law, who specializes in gang and youth-crime enforcement, said last week.</p>

<p>The risk of profiling is still serious, Howell added: "Law enforcement tend to see criminal and group crime in any peer group of black and brown kids." Howell, who read the proposed Senate gang bill and the now-dead House version, as well as the fusion gang assessment, pointed out that the target of the coordinated effort is "not just gangs, but cliques and crews."</p>

<p>"(The bills) open individuals who grow up in crime-ridden areas to prosecution and incarceration based on the conduct of others," Howell said. "The bills create 'gang' offenses where the actions of others are relevant to prove that there is a gang and that the gang is engaged in criminal activity. The criminal trial becomes a circus in which an individual can easily be prosecuted based on association."</p>

<p>Noblet laughed out loud at the idea that the new gang law would not be used to racially profile because it targets a large white street gang, too.</p>

<p>"I laugh. It has nothing to do with reality of what happens," he said.</p>

<p>Brad Rowe, who was the CEO of BOTEC Analysis when it studied Jackson's crime and now runs RPM Policy and Media, agreed in an interview from Los Angeles. "That's equal opportunity suppression. ... (Law enforcement) can use the color of law to take down white kids as well," he said. But that does not mean they will not use it to profile people of color, he warned. It can be an overly broad and harsh law for a wide variety of people and still be worse for targets of color.</p>

<p>Targeting Violence</p>

<p>Regardless of race, though, language in the gang bill means someone might get additional sentencing for a crime just because they are associated with a gang or crew on MAGI's list—even if the crime itself was not related to gang activity. In the 2017 session, Sen. Wiggins even used high-profile murders of Jessica Chambers and Mercedes Williamson allegedly by men who were in gangs to argue for the bill, even though prosecutors in both cases say the murders were not gang-ordered or sanctioned.</p>

<p>The narrative of MAGI members is that someone who is in a gang and commits a crime, even if it is not related, is committing a "gang crime"—which essentially criminalizes being in a gang. The Clarion-Ledger reported in August 2017 that MAGI embraces the most broad—and confusing—definition possible. "But a gang crime, according to the Mississippi Association of Gang Members, is defined as any crime in which the victim or perpetrator is a member of a gang. It can be gang-related, in which there's just someone who is affiliated, or gang-motivated, in which the crime is ordered or caused by gang activity," the Ledger reporter stated.</p>

<p>SB 2868 language is not even that broad, but it is disturbing enough, law professor Howell said. "The bills designate conduct which is largely already criminal—committing felonies, intimidating witnesses, obstructing justice—as 'criminal gang activity.' ... The bills then enhance sentences and facilitate accessorial liability based on association. They tack on five to 15 years consecutive not for the criminal conduct itself but because of association. They prohibit association with any member of a gang post-release," Howell said.</p>

<p>"Because the bills criminalize already criminal behavior, they would be symbolic but for the costly sentence enhancements. ... Gang arrests and allegations create situations in which it is impossible to get a fair trial, and the innocent will be swept up with the guilty, and the kitchen sink of all bad conduct is admissible as evidence."</p>

<p>The Mississippi Legislature's attempt to focus prosecution on gang membership over the criminal acts themselves is "15 years behind" the times, Noblet said. He pointed to attempts to push such laws in cities such as Los Angeles that have now turned to different approaches. "Violence is not a gang problem, which is why we're not anti-gang. We are anti-violence," he said.</p>

<p>That shift in criminal-justice approach to both gangs and violence is widespread today, in no small part because only a small percentage of gang and crew members actually commit the violent crime.</p>

<p>"Ninety percent of the time they can be changed, or changed to allies," Noblet said. "Ten percent of the time, they need to have asses locked up or killed. If the other 90 percent are wasting away in jail, they're not there to help families, and they give up and sit on corners doing nothing. It's a waste of human potential."</p>

<p>That is consistent across the country, crime experts say. Many young people join gangs to belong to something, or because they are growing up in miserable situations, often raised (or not raised) by parents caught in generational poverty, addiction or crime themselves. They want a "family."</p>

<p>Need for Counter-Intelligence</p>

<p>Sociologist and crime expert Andrew V. Papachristos, now of Northwestern University in Chicago and previously with Yale, authored a research report analyzing Chicago's version of "Operation Ceasefire," a "focused deterrence" strategy that the BOTEC report also recommended because it incorporates outreach and services for identified gang and crew members. It also specifically targets violence over gang membership, at least when done according to plan.</p>

<p>Mississippi's SB 2868 makes no mention of crime prevention beyond policing, and the fusion gang assessment only asks two questions related to prevention at the very end that still focus on gang membership: "What prevention programs are in elementary and/or middle schools to offset the recruitment of youths into gangs?" and "What methods do mental health facilities have in place for monitoring the gang presence in their facilities?"</p>

<p>In a 2015 report published by the American Society of Criminology, Papachristos along with David S. Kirk of Oxford University discussed the importance of focusing enforcement on the violence itself and who specifically is committing it.</p>

<p>"The underlying principle is to reach those factions that are involved in shootings, rather than simply reaching out to gang members writ large," they wrote.</p>

<p>"Unlike general deterrence, which aims to dissuade the general population from engaging in particular criminal behaviors by increasing the severity, certainty and swiftness of punishments associated with said crime, focused deterrence posits that crime reduction is best achieved by concentrating deterrence efforts on those groups or individuals involved directly in the targeted type of crime," the report stated.</p>

<p>"Rather than enact broad-sweeping policies that indiscriminately apply across populations and places, focused deterrence efforts honor traditional deterrence principles while leveraging existing policies and practices in innovative ways directly toward small offending populations."</p>

<p>The report emphasizes that those violent offenders are a very small percentage of the people identifying in some way with a gang, crew or other group, so the emphasis on gang membership can be a waste of time and resources.</p>

<p>Such gang enforcement can also increase crime and violence, studies show. A major reason, Noblet said, is that rounding up suspects who are merely associated with a gang but not involved in crime creates massive distrust among the very people police need to help them with intelligence gathering. He using military strategy to train cops and critique SB 2868: The proposed gang bill is more of an "anti-terrorism" approach, he said. "You go in and go after the assholes." Innocent people may be caught up, but at least you found the bomb.</p>

<p>Street violence, though, requires more sophisticated counter-intelligence, he said, which "targets good guys to protect."</p>

<p>"One of the basic ways to protect them is to start treating the good guys as human. ... It takes a long time to develop trust. You get the good population to separate themselves to separate themselves from embedded bad guys." Then it's easier to spot the shooters, and the good ones might help you find them. "That's targeted suppression," he said.</p>

<p>Focusing on the violence itself has a better chance of working, the experts say, especially since young people have formed and hung out with gangs throughout history with many of the early gangs, whether Italians and Irish fighting in New York City in the 1800s or the Gangsters, Latin Kings and Simon City Royals starting up decades ago in Chicago to rumble over racial turf. Today, though, most gang violence is intra-gang, Papachristos and Kirk say—meaning over beefs, rules or women rather than the inter-gang turf wars of old.</p>

<p>Communities must come together in a systemic way that goes far beyond policing to target the violence, such as that embraced by the Urban Peace Institute and recommended in the BOTEC report on Jackson gangs, Noblet said. That means intervention, prevention, targeted policing and re-entry all at once. "When you approach it that way, you start dealing with the real causes of violence," Noblet said. "It starts in the womb: poor education, too many drugs, lack of good transportation, lack of a way to afford clothes and food."</p>

<p>To reverse those violent cycles—and perhaps the desire to join a gang in the first place—Noblet emphasized that police should be at the table, but not at the head of it. He prefers to see a municipal authority take the lead, bringing nonprofit groups, ex-gang members and people willing to work with them, as well as law enforcement, to the table to plan a long-term strategy to reverse violence. "There's nothing wrong with police as police," he said. "They are trained to take charge. Civilians are trained to back off when police are present."</p>

<p>In addition, Noblet said, "good and effective policing requires a series of questions and answers based upon understanding human nature and understanding the facts. Threats and fear are counter-productive 90 percent of the time."</p>

<p>Costs of Suppression</p>

<p>The backers of SB 2868—and media friendly to their approach—seem to spend more time trying to convince the public that "gangs are a problem!" in Mississippi rather than focusing on the causes and potential solutions that go far beyond—or come before—gang enforcement. Noblet started his interview saying that communities need to accept that they have gangs; he is not even fond of dividing them into groups, crews and cliques. And he is cynical about why people deny that their communities have gangs: "People are afraid tourists won't visit and spend money," he said.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that gangs of some kind are in every community and county in Mississippi—whether street gang, white supremacist or a neighborhood group harassing other kids. A small proportion of their members can be violent, especially ones who have been through hell and have no strong role models or hope for the future.</p>

<p>But criminalizing being in the gang itself will not stop that violence, Noblet and other experts emphasize, nor is it likely to deter the ones most likely to commit violence. "There is nothing that law enforcement can do to them that has not already been done to them by their relatives," Noblet said of the young people prone to committing the worst crimes.</p>

<p>Not to mention, sending them to prison can turn them into worse criminals as the BOTEC analysis reports pointed out. And the younger they are when they're arrested, the more likely they will commit worse crime as an adult. The other top precursor for committing adult crime is dropping out of school.</p>

<p>By Stephen Wilson</p>

<p>The populations of most prisons, including in Mississippi, are organized into gangs—for protection. Many gang members are "blessed in"—or "beat in"—in prison, and come out far worse criminals. This is why smart re-entry preparation needs to be in place for those leaving prison. Many former gangsters say they came out of prison and had nothing to do on the streets—no job, no transportation—and returned to crime as a result. And many experienced violence inside prison and then bring the habit, and the trauma, back home.</p>

<p>Still, "most of the time, re-entry is ignored," Noblet said.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Legislature has grappled with legislation that would increase re-entry options and resources in the state, but it stalled last session. And the backers of the gang bill are so focused on sending gangsters to prison for longer periods that they talk little about what happens when they come back to their communities.</p>

<p>Ironically, both the harsh gang enforcement and the lack of re-entry may prevent one of the top ways to reduce both gang activity and violence in communities, Babe Howell of CUNY Law said.</p>

<p>"Harsh penalties and gang suppression have strengthened gangs because it disrupts the normal process of maturing out of gangs and moving on to work and family," she said. "Chicago and California have long histories of gang suppression and MS-13 crackdowns; these experiences suggest that gang suppression by law enforcement is not a means of eliminating or even weakening gangs."</p>

<p>Howell suggests setting up systems of "violence interrupters"—former criminals and gang members who want to help young people choose better options than they did, as happens in an organized way now in many American cities.</p>

<p>"Cure Violence models that focus on working with at-risk kids using credible messengers (often former gang members or convicts who have lost years of their lives and loved ones to violence) seem to have robust impact without reliance on expensive incarceration which merely delays problems rather than resolving them," she said.</p>

<p>"The bills being proposed in Mississippi would prevent former gang members from doing violence-interruption work or returning to communities and working with at-risk youth," Howell said.</p>

<p>She added that the gang bill can also be costly if lawmakers do not take into account the cost of imprisoning many more people based on guilt by association.</p>

<p>"I don't see a budget analysis, but the cost to taxpayers is likely to be great," Howell warned about the proposed gang bill.</p>

<p>"An individual might sell drugs or be involved in an assault that is related to their group affiliation, and the sentence for the assault might be two years, but a gang enhancement could elevate it by five to 15 years." Then taxpayers foot the bill.</p>

<p>Costs of Suppression</p>

<p>Lawmakers in both the Mississippi House and Senate asked about a fiscal note for the legislation due to presumed extra costs for the Department of Corrections to incarcerate more convicted gang members.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Legislature passed a massive criminal-justice reform measure, House Bill 585, which was supposed to save the state money and decrease the number of men and women in custody.</p>

<p>The plan worked in the first year after HB 585 became law, with the number of inmates dropping by 11 percent. In the second year, however, the prison population began to climb again.</p>

<p>In 2013, MDOC had nearly 23,000 men and women behind bars, but hit a low point around summer 2015, with about 17,000 inmates. Since then, that number has edged up again.</p>

<p>Currently, there are 18,946 inmates in custody in Mississippi; with inmates in community corrections and other programs, that number is up to 20,738.</p>

<p>Another 32,796 Mississippians are on probation or parole. Black inmates make up 62 percent of the total number of offenders, while white inmates make up only 36 percent of the total population. More than 40 percent of men and women are behind bars in Mississippi are incarcerated for drug or property crimes.</p>

<p>Sen. Wiggins, though, does not believe his gang bill will increase costs.</p>

<p>"It's more about intensity than volume, and as you know, I've been a staunch defender of the criminal justice reform that this body and this Legislature passed... So, no, I don't think it will negligibly affect that," Wiggins said.</p>

<p>Simmons asked Wiggins to join him to request a fiscal note on the bill, citing reforms lawmakers passed previously that ended up "stacking the population" instead of lowering costs. At press time, no fiscal note was attached to Senate Bill 2868.</p>

<p>Four years ago, the Legislature patted itself on the back for reforming Mississippi's criminal-justice system with sweeping legislation that was arguably one of the most impactful pieces of public policy passed in recent years. And they should have. Bipartisan efforts to empty prisons of nonviolent offenders are worthy of celebration. But passing House Bill 585 was only the beginning. Now it's time to implement those changes.</p>

<p>A huge part of criminal-justice reform requires paying particular attention to recidivism and re-entry programming around the state. How easy is it for former inmates to get housing, transportation, identification and jobs? In Mississippi, not easy at all. That is part of why the 2014 criminal-justice reform legislation created different task forces and committees of people who get together and work on these ideas. Three years later, those committees have reports, ideas and plans to implement several reforms statewide.</p>

<p>Now it is time for lawmakers and the governor to listen and implement those plans.</p>

<p>"While agreeing that several recommendations from earlier reports should be republished, the task force believed the report should emphasize the need for reinvestment in programs for persons post release," the 2017 report from the Corrections and Criminal Justice Task Force says.</p>

<p>Legislation to open up drug courts as re-entry courts died this session already, despite the task force recommending them. Alternatively, lawmakers are considering creating an additional penalty for criminal gang activity, as a proposed deterrent to gang involvement across the state, a proposal that will likely have the opposite effect on the state's prison population than House Bill 585 had. Criminal-justice reforms must be considered cohesively and comprehensively, and technically lawmakers have a lot left to implement from House Bill 585, with little appetite or even awareness that they need to.</p>

<p>The Legislature has figured out the solution to most of its problems is to sic a committee on them. Lottery? Education funding formula? Religious exemptions for vaccines? A committee can fix that. This does not mean we disapprove of studying topics and getting clear evidence-based data to base policy off on—in fact, we encourage that. But once the committee has done its hard work and presented data and recommendations, why on earth would you cherry-pick the results, or worse yet, have to be lobbied to legislate recommendations you asked for as lawmakers in the first place?</p>

<p>It is time for lawmakers to actually use the data and research they have asked for to implement criminal-justice reforms in the state.</p>

<h2 id="opinionmoretransparencyfromjpdneeded">OPINION: More Transparency from JPD Needed</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adofo Minka</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-02-14</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/feb/14/opinion-more-transparency-jpd-needed/ </p>

<p>It appears that JPD is in line with the national trend of engaging in character assassinations of victims of extra-judicial killings. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Adofo Minka</p>

<p>It has been more than two weeks since two Jackson Police Department officers extra-judicially killed beloved daughter, mother and Jackson State University student Crystaline Barnes. The community waits in suspense for some facts on what happened on Jan. 27, 2018.</p>

<p>JPD has been less than forthcoming regarding basic information concerning this shooting. Instead, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore, a man whom Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba lauded for being familiar with the national trends in criminal justice, has employed a tight-lipped approach eerily similar to those used in cases involving the extra-judicial killings of unarmed black men, women and children nationally.</p>

<p>Instead of offering transparency, Moore refuses to identify the officers or discuss whether they have histories of misconduct. This basic information should not be a mystery to residents. Barnes' killing by a hail of bullets while driving makes clear the importance of knowing the types of officers we have occupying our communities. The stray bullets and Barnes' car, which went out of control after the officers shot her, placed the lives and property of others in direct danger. JPD ought to know better. It is unacceptable that while Barnes' family mourns her killing, officers get a paid vacation free of any public scrutiny or ridicule, both of which are warranted.</p>

<p>Moore refuses to discuss JPD's use-of-force policy in any detail. This is a policy that the general public should know about. Further, residents of Jackson should have had the right to discuss and critique this policy publicly before it went into effect, as it directly impacts all residents. This is a basic issue of transparency. There is no excuse for Moore's refusal to provide such information to the public. There is no excuse why JPD has failed to do so in the past. What is in that policy that the department feels it has to hide? Does such a policy even exist? A failure to provide such basic information is a breach of the public trust.</p>

<p>It appears that JPD is in line with the national trend of engaging in character assassinations of victims of extra-judicial killings. Great emphasis has been placed on allegations that Barnes attempted to run someone off the road before her deadly encounter with officers. These allegations have yet to be substantiated in any concrete manner. JPD should have answered questions the allegations before releasing any statements regarding Barnes' alleged criminal behavior prior to her death, as well as a blurry mugshot of her. Moore should extend the same respect to Barnes and her family that has been afforded to the officers who killed her. This is JPD's attempt to control the narrative around her death.</p>

<p>The Clarion-Ledger reported that she had been in a Pre-Trial Diversion program and had outstanding traffic fines. But Barnes' prior criminal history has nothing to do with her extra-judicial killing. This is further character assassination and serves no other purpose other than to replace her cloak of innocence with a cloak of guilt.</p>

<p>A quick Internet search reveals that there have been seven JPD-officer-involved shootings that local media reported since November 2017. Two of these resulted in extra-judicial killings. Two resulted in officers wounding people. Luckily no one was harmed in the others. The number of officer-involved shootings in such a short period of time proves that there needs be closer scrutiny placed on JPD officers' use of force.</p>

<p>Barnes' killing should serve as a call to demand more transparency and accountability. The fact that JPD is investigating itself is unacceptable. It is akin to expecting the fox to investigate what happened in the hen house after he has ravaged it. The Hinds County District Attorney's Office investigating the matter to determine whether any charges will be brought against the officers is also unacceptable. The office depends on JPD to aid in its prosecution of cases, so it is biased and should recuse itself.</p>

<p>Residents need to demand that the city require a true independent investigation. Moore needs to release the names of the officers involved in all of the officer-involved shootings since November. JPD needs to release a clear statement outlining its policies concerning officer-involved shootings. The City of Jackson must establish a human-rights charter and a commission that gives an independent elected body with subpoena and investigative powers to address human-rights abuses in the city.</p>

<h2 id="opinionantigangactwouldbeadisasterformississippi">OPINION: Anti-Gang Act Would Be a Disaster for Mississippi</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Blake Feldman</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-02-07</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/feb/07/anti-gang-act-would-be-disaster-mississippi/ </p>

<p>If signed into law, the Mississippi Anti-Gang Act (House Bill 541 and Senate Bill 2868) would be a civil liberty, fiscal and moral disaster. It is bad policy by any metric.</p>

<p>This legislation has been proposed for several sessions now (House Bill 1371 and Senate Bill 2027 in 2017, SB 2206 in 2016), and each year its proponents are not able to provide more than anecdotal evidence that gangs are a growing problem nor that the legislation would help address an alleged gang problem.</p>

<p>This session, the purported evidence of a gang problem is based on a survey where law enforcement named gangs in their jurisdictions. Nationwide, gang policing is scrutinized as racially bias and rife with due-process violations—especially regarding the low standards many departments use before labeling someone a gang member. If the legislature haphazardly passes the Mississippi Anti-Gang Act, dramatically broadening the legal definition of “gang members” and attaching parole ineligibility as a term of sentence, it will be contrary to a bipartisan effort to reduce Mississippi’s prison population.</p>

<p>The gang-policing practices that this legislation promotes have devastated innocent black and Latino children across the country. What has become abundantly clear is that gang policing without oversight entangles far too many innocent residents, especially residents of color. In 2016, the California state auditor found the state’s gang database to be remarkably inaccurate, so much so that it included 42 people who were babies when law enforcement labeled them as gang members. Rather than paving the way for local and state agencies to find themselves embroiled in a similar scandal, our legislature should ensure these civil-liberty concerns are addressed on the front end.</p>

<p>Most criminologists and policing experts who are advocates of targeted gang suppression note that it has to be one piece of a larger strategy to address violent crime, and a comprehensive approach is worth discussing in Mississippi. However, using subjective data as evidence of a gang problem, legislating an overly broad and vague definition for gang members, and attaching more prison time for people convicted of gang activity is hardly a balanced and reasoned approach. The Mississippi Anti-Gang Act flies in the face of recent legislative efforts to reduce our unsustainable prison population—which is currently the fourth highest per capita in the country.</p>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>JACKSON — Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, did not want to debate the "anti-gang" bill for long this morning, and after about half an hour, he tabled House Bill 541, noting that the Senate had already passed its version of the legislation. Gipson will likely take up that bill when it comes over to the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>His motivation for the legislation, Gipson said, comes from reading the State Gang Threat Assessment, which is based on gang data that 71 law-enforcement agencies submitted on questionnaires at the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators Conference in 2017.</p>

<p>Some representatives requested to see the study, as they had not seen it before the bill came to the floor.</p>

<p>Policing Gang Membership Over Violence?</p>

<p>Brad Rowe was a lead researcher on the 2016 Botec Analysis study of Jackson crime, including a "Gang Violence Assessment" for Hinds County, for which the Mississippi Legislature paid $500,000. After reading the more recent gang assessment, which the Department of Homeland Security provided to the Jackson Free Press, Rowe warned that focusing too much on gang membership can be shortsighted.</p>

<p>"Reading the assessment," he said Wednesday in a phone interview from Los Angeles, "they're clearly going after this idea of 'gang.' One thing we've learned outside of Jackson is that it's much more helpful for authorities, whether law enforcement or government organizations doing mental health, to go after violence rather than gangs."</p>

<p>Adding that he is not a "hug-a-thug," Rowe, the former BOTEC CEO who now runs RPM Policy and Media in Los Angeles, continued, "The concept of criminalizing gang members ... is not all good. They do serve a function. A lot of kids don't have families that support them and don't feel that they're safe. Gangs are a way to have a group that protects you, stands by you. Yes, sometimes they ask you to do stuff outside of the law, and they're going to do it."</p>

<p>Other crime experts echo the advice of focusing on violence over criminalizing gang membership itself, which can take a lot of resources for a small yield over time, especially since marginal gang members can come out of prison as more hardened gangsters and criminals.</p>

<p>Sociologist and crime expert Andrew V. Papachristos, now of Northwestern University in Chicago and previously with Yale, authored a research report analyzing Chicago's version of "Operation Ceasefire," a popular violence intervention that focuses on violence over gang membership. In the 2015 report published by the American Society of Criminology, Papachristos along with David S. Kirk of Oxford University discussed the importance of focusing enforcement on the violence itself and who specifically is committing it. "The underlying principle is to reach those factions that are involved in shootings, rather than simply reaching out to gang members writ large," they wrote.</p>

<p>"Unlike general deterrence, which aims to dissuade the general population from engaging in particular criminal behaviors by increasing the severity, certainty and swiftness of punishments associated with said crime, focused deterrence posits that crime reduction is best achieved by concentrating deterrence efforts on those groups or individuals involved directly in the targeted type of crime. Rather than enact broad-sweeping policies that indiscriminately apply across populations and places, focused deterrence efforts honor traditional deterrence principles while leveraging existing policies and practices in innovative ways directly toward small offending populations."</p>

<p>Often, those violent offenders are a very small percentage of the people identifying in some way with a gang, crew or other group, the report explains.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Senate's legislation would expand the definition of a gang in state law, broadening the net rather than focusing it, and make "criminal gang activity" an additional penalty for felonies committed if a district attorney proves they are a part of a gang, in addition to whatever underlying offense a person committed.</p>

<p>That effort makes Rowe nervous, including for law enforcement trying to stop violence in communities. "The more that the establishment goes after this concept of 'gang' rather than going after violence, the more the gang members distrust the system," he said. That means that young people can be less likely to tell the cops when they are in danger or to report crimes they see. And that reticence can extend to community and family members who want the violence to stop, but do not want young people's future ruined by over-criminalization for simply showing an association to a gang at some point.</p>

<p>"They want appropriate policing in their neighborhoods," Rowe said of communities often targeted by gang sweeps, "but don't want neighborhoods to be over-policed. It's hard."</p>

<p>BOTEC researchers also warned that one of the top two precursors for a young person committing worse crime as an adult is being put into the criminal-system system as a juvenile.</p>

<p>The Potential for Profiling</p>

<p>House Democrats had a lot of questions about the measure, and brought up examples of sorority and fraternity members, or teammates on a sports team potentially being targeted as "gangs" if the legislation becomes law.</p>

<p>"Law enforcement would have to look at that and determine whether in fact this is a gang or a group of young people," Gipson told Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, who asked about a group of kids with similar tattoos or wearing the same colors.</p>

<p>Bell brought up racial profiling in his questions.</p>

<p>"In today's climate with racial profiling, and individuals being shot and murdered by police officers, do you not understand my concern about this?" Bell asked Gipson.</p>

<p>"I don't agree that there's racial profiling going on, gentleman. I know that there have been instances ... ," Gipson said.</p>

<p>"Well, gentleman, be black for a day, and find out. It happens," Bell said.</p>

<p>Rowe also addressed the profiling potential of overly broad gang laws and enforcement strategies that give law enforcement and prosecutors the discretion to bring additional charges. "First of all, it's a PR nightmare for law enforcement. All these stories are going to come out," he said. Communities and the young people themselves will ask why police are targeting young people in neighborhoods, middle schools, high schools, even if some are involved in bad activity. "Criminalizing being poor black youth in Jackson. That's the story, and all people are going to hear." That, in turn, will be counter-productive to building trust and curbing the violence, he said.</p>

<p>When reminded that proponents of the gang bill would point out that it would also target the Simon City Royals, a white gang, Rowe said that fact does not change the underlying problem with such broad enforcement. "That's equal-opportunity suppression. Not just going after black boys, but white kids who are bad kids, too. (Law enforcement) can use the color of law to take down white kids as well," he said.</p>

<p>Gipson opted to table the bill, letting it die on today's deadline, noting that the Senate passed a version of the bill yesterday. The House will have to debate the "ant-gang" bill again later in the session.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Feb. 7, the Senate passed the gang legislation from Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, over significant resistance from Democrats.</p>

<p>Sen. John Horhn, D-Jackson, shared his reservations about the legislation, telling Wiggins that in some neighborhoods—or even in prison—a person might join a gang for self-protection.</p>

<p>"I'm concerned about some of the unintended consequences of doing this," Horhn told Wiggins on Wednesday during debate.</p>

<p>The BOTEC researchers found that self-protection was a factor for gangs in Jackson, as it is around the country. Rowe said that, under the extended gang laws, a young person might be a Facebook friend with someone who commits a violent act. That young person does not turn him in, perhaps because he is afraid of retaliation, and the law could justify charging him. "Are you then complicit in the crime? Involved in the cover-up? I don't know," he said.</p>

<p>Rowe emphasized that understanding and treating trauma is key to preventing youth violence, whether gang-related or not. "The violent kids have often been abused physically, mentally, sexually and neglected," he said. "Somewhere in there they didn't get the tools to deal with that trauma and anger. They are then sent to schools where, if they have discipline problems, they're treated like prisoners."</p>

<p>The BOTEC report on gangs endorsed a targeted "Operation Ceasefire" approach to gang enforcement as well and laid out a model for countering gang violence based on the Urban Peace Institute's Programs for Gang Intervention.</p>

<p>Sen. Derrick Simmons, D-Greenville, offered an amendment to putting a measure in the bill that would force it into conference between senators and representatives. His amendment failed, and the Senate passed Senate Bill 2868 by a vote of 35-14. The bill is held on a motion to reconsider, which the Senate must lift by Monday for the measure to advance.</p>

<p>Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps proposed a change to Jackson's ordinances at a Jan. 30 meeting that would decriminalize possession of user-level amounts of marijuana. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps proposed a change to Jackson's ordinances last week that would decriminalize possession of user-level amounts of marijuana. The public can attend a hearing at 6 p.m. today at City Hall for citizens to voice their concerns and ask questions.</p>

<p>If the ordinance passes, those in Jackson in possession of 30 grams of marijuana or less would pay a fine of no more than $100 and not serve any prison time. Prescription marijuana would not be subject to these same penalties in the City ordinances.</p>

<p>"We're introducing this to decriminalize user level amounts of marijuana because for far too long we have made a practice of turning users into criminals," Stamps said at the Jackson City Council meeting on Jan. 30.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Code enforces punishments for marijuana possession of 30 grams or less by a fine of $100 to $250 with no jail time for the first offense. However, a second conviction for simple possession within two years is a misdemeanor carrying the punishment of a $250 fine, no more than 60 days in the county jail and mandatory enrollment in a drug-education program approved by the Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse of the State Department of Mental Health, unless a court finds this inappropriate. Any subsequent conviction after that within two years merits a fine between $250 and $1,000 and up to six months in county jail.</p>

<p>If a person operating a motor vehicle possesses up to 30 grams of marijuana, he or she would face a misdemeanor charge, and if convicted, would face a maximum fine of $1,000, up to 90 days in county jail or both.</p>

<p>Stamps' ordinance does not address how the City will handle second-time offenders of simple possession laws or when drivers carry 30 ounces or less of marijuana.</p>

<p>Councilman Stamps is targeting Jackson's ordinances, which are "presently silent," as he characterized them, on punishing simple possession within Jackson's city limits. The current ordinances about simple possession only say that no person charged with possession of one ounce or less would face the punishments for those violating the City's drug-paraphernalia ordinances.</p>

<p>City ordinances include an extensive list of illegal items considered to be drug paraphernalia that can be used for planting, growing, preparing, manufacturing or ingesting outlawed substances. Persons violating these paraphernalia ordinances are subject to a fine not to exceed $500, city jail time up to 90 days or both.</p>

<p>The new proposed ordinance also suggests training for the Jackson Police Department to learn the difference between the proposed City ordinance and State law.</p>

<p>"Whereas, the City Council finds that it is in the City's best interest to provide local law enforcement with the ability to charge individuals in simple possession of marijuana with an offense that neither unfairly stigmatizes the offender(s), nor creates an undue burden on the City in regards to jail costs," Stamps' introduction of the ordinance reads.</p>

<p>A 2013 American Civil Liberties Union study on the racial disparities of criminalizing marijuana showed that although blacks and whites use marijuana pretty much equally, blacks are 3.73 times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. The study also says enforcing marijuana laws can cost $3.6 billion annually.</p>

<p>Jennifer Riley-Collins, the executive director of the ACLU of Mississippi, spoke at the meeting, commending Stamps, while offering ways the ordinance could be improved so that fines will not lock poorer people into a debtors' prison scheme.</p>

<p>"(The proposed ordinance) could potentially be plagued with the same selective enforcement woes as marijuana criminal laws, and those unable to pay fines could face arrest and imprisonment," Riley-Collins said to the council. "We therefore ask in its implementation that the City of Jackson ensure that those who cannot afford to pay the associated fine because of indigence are not penalized for being poor...."</p>

<p>Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore promised a "thorough" investigation into Crystaline Barnes' death. (Photo from separate press conference held on Jan. 29 not at police department.) File Photo. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Early Saturday morning, two Jackson police officers shot at 21-year-old Crystaline Barnes during a traffic stop in response to a report that Barnes may have forced another motorist off the roadway, but is so far only providing vague information about the deadly incident as well as whether its use-of-force policy for moving vehicles meets national guidelines.</p>

<p>JPD also did not confirm whether Barnes died of a gunshot or from the collision soon afterward, saying only that she was "fatally wounded." The department has, so far, refused to name the officers who fired into the moving vehicle, who are now on paid leave, but has implied that the deceased young woman may have a criminal history. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice advised police departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department spokesman Roderick Holmes said the officer that made the stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said in a statement Saturday.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," the statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect's vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Then Holmes said Barnes drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>Both officers are on administrative leave with pay as the internal criminal investigation unfolds. No outside firms are helping with the investigation, but interim Police Chief Anthony Moore said at a press conference at the police department today that Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith's office has been involved with the investigation from the outset. At the conclusion of the investigation, a Hinds County grand jury will decide on the facts and whether the officers will face trial, he said.</p>

<p>While the JPD has not released the names of the officers involved in the shooting or even a definite cause of death, Holmes did sent out a blurry, disheveled photo of Barnes that appears to be a mugshot, hinting at but not confirming that the deceased woman had been in trouble before.</p>

<p>Moore would not say if the officers had been in police-involved situations in the past, saying he did not want to talk about personnel issues. He also said JPD's lethal-force policy depends on the situation and that officers have to gauge the situation to determine whether they need to use deadly force.</p>

<p>The approach of giving officers wide discretion on whether to fire into a moving vehicle is not considered a national best practice for policing, however. The Police Executive Research Forum released a report in March 2016, "Guiding Principles on Use of Force," warning about the high dangers of shooting into moving vehicles. The report discusses the New York Police Department's reversal of the moving-vehicles policy, especially after the death of Sean Bell there, and the effect it has had on police use of force there.</p>

<p>"For example, more than 40 years ago, the New York City Police Department adopted a prohibition on officers shooting at or from a moving vehicle, unless a person in the vehicle is using or threatening deadly force by means other than the vehicle itself. That NYPD policy, adopted in 1972, resulted in an immediate, sharp reduction in uses of lethal force in New York City. Police shooting incidents declined from nearly 1,000 a year in 1972 to 665 the following year, and have fallen steadily ever since, to fewer than 100 per year today," the report stated.</p>

<p>Police officers shooting into moving vehicles has drawn national scrutiny in the United States due to the dangers it poses and not only to the driver. Law-enforcement experts warn that not only the targeted driver be injured or killed, but that an out-of-control vehicle then poses dangers to both the officers as well as bystanders and property. Officers should "move" out of the path of moving vehicles, policing experts advise, if at all possible and then follow specific procedures that should be part of their training.</p>

<p>"If you're successful and shoot the driver, now you have an uncontrolled vehicle," Geoff Alpert, an expert in policing tactics at the University of South Carolina, told VOX. "And it's just as likely his foot is going to go on the gas as it is to not go on the gas."</p>

<p>The national Police Executive Research Forum points to federal case law that requires detailed use-of-force policies for shooting into vehicles, while advising departments to not allow it.</p>

<p>"In Graham v. Connor, the Supreme Court outlines broad principles on how police use of force is to be considered and judged. But the Court leaves it to individual police agencies to determine how best to incorporate those principles into their own policies and training, in order to direct officers on how to perform their duties on a daily basis. Graham v. Connor is the common denominator across the United States, and all police agencies must have use-of-force policies that meet Graham's standards. But many police departments have chosen to go beyond the bare requirements of Graham, by adopting more detailed policies and training on issues such as shooting at moving vehicles, rules on pursuits, guidelines on the use of Electronic Control Weapons ...," the forum's report stated.</p>

<p>The forum complains that many police departments, however, just ignore those federal standards, which The Washington Post reported has led to more than 200 deaths since 2017, including 15-year-old Jordan Edwards in a Dallas suburb. Often, departments get away with loose standards on firing into moving vehicles because the departments investigate themselves, as JPD said it plans to do here.</p>

<p>Still, the new police chief assured Jackson citizens that it will do the right thing in investigating its officers use of force.</p>

<p>"Again this is a tragedy, it is a real tragedy," Moore told reporters. "Nobody wins in this situation. It's very unfortunate, but I want to assure the family and I want to assure the public that this investigation is going to be fair, unbiased, and it's going to be thorough and complete for everyone that's involved."</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba says the City of Jackson will not back down from its anti-profiling ordinance, which the U.S. Justice Department, under Jeff Sessions’ lead, has taken issue with. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The City of Jackson's anti-profiling ordinance will stay on the books, as far as Chokwe A. Lumumba is concerned. The Mississippi Legislature targeted the 2010 ordinance as a "sanctuary city" policy in 2017, and now U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Justice Department has added the capital city to his list of 23 jurisdictions he believes could be violating federal laws that prohibit local or state governments from restricting communication between immigration services and government entities.</p>

<p>Now, Jackson police officers cannot ask about a person's immigration status unless it is in the course of a criminal investigation or necessary to assist federal law enforcement. The Justice Department has taken issue with this part of city code, however, and sent a second letter to the City last week threatening to subpoena documents as well as retract federal funds to the city.</p>

<p>Lumumba says the ordinance complies with federal law, however, and that it actually helps community-policing efforts across the city.</p>

<p>"Racial profiling is patently illegal," Lumumba told reporters Monday. "... Furthermore, racial profiling is ineffective. It alienates communities from law enforcement, disrupts community policing efforts, and causes law enforcement to forfeit credibility and trust among the people they are sworn to protect and serve."</p>

<p>Lumumba said if an undocumented immigrant is worried that police will ask about his or her immigration status, they are less likely to come forward if and when they are the victim of a crime or a key witness to one.</p>

<p>"Just as someone who is undocumented can be the perpetrator of a crime, we know that someone who is undocumented can be the victim of a crime—and often are victims of crimes, not only in our community but across the country," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>"We know that this is the case because we know that undocumented individuals often don't have identification. Therefore, they do not open bank accounts. Therefore, they often have great amounts of cash on them, and people know this and target them and look to abuse them in these circumstances, and that is not an environment or culture we want to promote."</p>

<p>In a Jan. 24, 2018, letter, the DOJ asked Jackson officials for all documents "reflecting any orders, directives, instructions, or guidance to your law enforcement employees."</p>

<p>Lumumba says those documents do not exist.</p>

<p>"Our response to the Department of Justice was that, first and foremost, we're in compliance with the law. The law that DOJ references is one about providing information obtained by law enforcement ... if we don't inquire about it, then we don't have information to provide. Therefore, we are in accordance with the law," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>If DOJ determines that Jackson is out of compliance with federal immigration laws, the City might have to return federal grant funds and possibly be deemed ineligible for police-department grants going forward. Lumumba said he has talked to organizations working with other cities around the country on the issue, which showed him that Jackson's ordinance is "really on the lighter end of things."</p>

<p>Uniting for DACA?</p>

<p>Immigrants and activists called on Mississippi lawmakers to support legislation that enables immigrants in the state to be eligible for in-state college tuition last week at a press conference.</p>

<p>Rep. Kathy Sykes, D-Jackson, said it is important to unite behind students with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, status and encourage Congress to support its reauthorization.</p>

<p>"On the state level, we have young people who have been here who have exceeded in their education; they've done very, very well. However, when they attempt to enroll in college, they have to pay out-of-state tuition, and that is patently unfair," Sykes said at the Capitol last week. "I have introduced a bill to change that, and hopefully we can gather enough support so these young people can continue on this productive and positive path they are on."</p>

<p>Sykes filed House Bill 33 to allow undocumented students or students with temporary visas to pay in-state tuition as long as they have a high-school diploma and have lived in Mississippi for five years or more in a row.</p>

<p>That bill died on Tuesday after the committee deadline. On the federal level, the negotiations on the DACA program and immigration reform continues, with President Donald Trump offering to extend DACA protections for millions of young people who came to the U.S. as kids in exchange for a multi-billion-dollar wall on the southern border. Immigrants' rights groups nationally have decried the president's proposal.</p>

<p>Ending Temporary Status</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that temporary protected status, or TPS, for Haitians will end by July 22, 2019. Additionally, the department is phasing out TPS for Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador. TPS is a program that enables people who have a natural or political disaster in their country to come to the U.S. and get work authorization. Patricia Ice, legal director of the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance, says that ending TPS will affect people who came here from Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador back in 1999 and 2000. She said many of them have children and have started lives here, considering themselves Americans.</p>

<p>"The government is trying to deport these people. They have terminated several TPS programs for people from Central America, from Haiti and other countries, and we have to stop that," Ice said at the Capitol last week.</p>

<p>MIRA held the press conference to oppose House Bill 1506, which also died in committee on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The proposed bill would require law enforcement officers to inquire about a person's immigration status when they arrest them as well as penalize businesses who contract with undocumented workers.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The celebration was small, but the impact is likely to be large. On Friday, Jan. 26, nine local law enforcement officers who work in Hinds County graduated from week-long mental-health training to help them on the job.</p>

<p>Crisis Intervention Team training, or CIT for short, is an intensive program. Officers heard from professionals, learning about mental-health disorders, specific illnesses and how treatment works. They also learned de-escalation techniques and tools to use when confronting a person having a mental-health crisis, which can escalate into deadly encounters if handled poorly.</p>

<p>On the last two days, the graduates ran through live-action scenarios to practice what they learned. Hinds County sheriffs, Jackson Police Department officers, and several college campus and other police officers in the Jackson-Hinds area trained last week, as well as a handful of Mississippi Department of Corrections staff members.</p>

<p>This is the first group to graduate from with CIT certification in Hinds County. Law-enforcement officers in Lauderdale County and in Meridian have used CIT training for a while. Chief Deputy Ward Calhoun from Lauderdale County spoke to graduates before they got their certificates and pins last week. He told them CIT had to be a team effort, using a stool he brought with him to illustrate that local mental-health centers, organizations like National Alliance on Mental Illness and law enforcement must coordinate for CIT to work.</p>

<p>"In the long run, I think something really unique happens. Not only do you become a better CIT officer, you just become a better officer," Calhoun told the graduates. "You become a better person—that's what we're supposed to be doing. ... We ought to be the folks that the community turns to for a solution."</p>

<p>The ceremony officially marks a shift in how law enforcement and the mental-health sectors intersect in the city and county. In Hinds County, when any law-enforcement officer encounters a person she or he suspects is having a mental crisis, they call the mobile crisis team from Hinds Behavioral Health, the county's community mental-health center, to come to the scene.</p>

<p>Officers responding to calls or mobile crisis teams can now call a CIT-trained officer to help de-escalate the situation for a person in crisis, too. American Medical Response, the city and county emergency medic and ambulance provider, will be called to the scene to take the person to St. Dominic's Hospital to stabilize.</p>

<p>Merit Health Central agreed to provide overflow beds if needed.</p>

<p>In other words, Hinds County now has a flow chart and a single point of entry to coordinate mental-health care for those experiencing a crisis instead of that person spending a night or longer in jail when they need to be receiving care instead.</p>

<p>JPD Commander Herman Horton said Jackson has about eight CIT-trained officers and reminded the graduates of the oath they took as a part of the program.</p>

<p>"Bear in mind that when that phone rings, you're going to have to come because that's what you swore you would do when you graduated from this class," he said.</p>

<p>More Training Statewide</p>

<p>Attorney General Jim Hood is hoping training for law-enforcement officials expands statewide to prevent men and women with these issues from being incarcerated. He told the state mental-health task force last week that he wants for law-enforcement officers and professionals to get to know each other in communities.</p>

<p>"We're not only trying to de-escalate the situation but get law enforcement at those trainings (with) mental-health people ... so they can call once the situation is calmed down so they (people having crises) don't have to go to jail and cost the county or city money to house them, and they are put in a bed where they need to be," Hood said.</p>

<p>The problem for many Mississippians already charged with crimes who want to plead insanity or need mental evaluation is that only a handful of stabilization beds are available for them. The State has a 35-bed forensic unit at Mississippi State Hospital. Of those beds, 15 are used for men and women charged with crimes who need to be assessed for their competency to stand trial. The other 20 beds are for those Mississippians judges have deemed incompetent to stand trial. The building these people are held in is out of the last century.</p>

<p>"It's an antiquated facility with Yale locks on the doors," Hood said last week. "It's like you're walking back in the 1920s era. It's eerie."</p>

<p>Hood's experience echoes what psychiatrist Tom Recore told senators earlier this month when Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, held a hearing about the state's forensic unit. Recore told the Senate Judiciary B Committee that the unit needs a new building, and the Mississippi Department of Mental Health is working on locating a new space or seeing how much it will cost to renovate the current building.</p>

<p>Sen. Briggs Hopson, R-Vicksburg, authored the Forensic Mental Health Act, which the Senate could consider next week. The legislation would allow more providers to examine men and women charged with crimes who need mental-health evaluations. Currently, few providers besides the forensic unit at Whitfield can provide the courts with mental assessments. This legislation would allow courts to contract with more providers, certified by DMH, in addition to ensuring men and women with those needs maintain their constitutional rights.</p>

<p>'Elephant in the Room'</p>

<p>The state mental health task force is working to find ways to standardize the system of mental health care from county to county, but Hood emphasized the difficulties the committee will face without funding. The U.S. Department of Justice sued Mississippi in 2016 for its over-reliance on institutions to treat people with mental illnesses instead of treating them in the community. The lawsuit is still ongoing, and if federal and state officials cannot reach an agreement soon, the case will go to trial in early 2019. Hood blamed the Legislature for underfunding DMH for the lawsuit.</p>

<p>"I did end up getting to that point of addressing the kind of elephant in the room with all of us here, and that is funding," Hood said. "I don't anticipate having it. They're not going to do it because some federal court order is going to do it, and I got to defend the state until we get to that point."</p>

<p>DMH has not asked for additional funding in fiscal-year 2019, however, and the department has said it will move $10 million of its funds to community-based services if the amount it receives is the same as last fiscal year. Whether or not the Legislature will fund DMH at the level DMH requested remains to be seen.</p>

<h2 id="stategetsbfortraffickinglaws">State Gets ‘B’ for Trafficking Laws</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-31</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jan/31/state-gets-b-trafficking-laws/ </p>

<p>JACKSON — Pearl Assistant Police Chief Dean Scott pulled out his phone in the Mississippi Capitol on Jan. 17 to show just how easy it is to solicit sex from likely trafficked girls just minutes down the road.</p>

<p>Scott pulled up Craigslist, a popular classified-advertising site that has drawn fire for allowing human-trafficking ads in the past, on his smartphone's browser. "You can buy anything from a car to a child on it," Scott said as the site opened. "She's in a motel right there on High Street," he said, turning his phone around to show an ad of a teenage girl who he sees on Craigslist every day. Her ad says she's 25, but Scott said she just turned 18.</p>

<p>A lawmaker asked why someone had not already gone to the spot to make an arrest as law enforcement knew what might be happening there. The revolving-door aspect of trafficking requires an inexhaustible effort that many lack the manpower to handle efficiently.</p>

<p>"Everyone I showed you was posted today," Scott told the Jackson Free Press after scrolling through a seemingly endless list of phone numbers to call for sex on Backpage and similar listings on Craigslist. Both companies have come under intense fire for allowing such ads, and both say they have removed the ads, with Craigslist at one point replacing its "Adults Services" link with "Censored."</p>

<p>"It's kind of like stamping out the flu. It's not going to happen—it's too much money," Scott said. "We're talking about a billion-dollar-a-year industry."</p>

<p>Still, had law enforcement gone to pick up the girl Scott showed to lawmakers before she turned 18, Child Protective Services may well not have come to the scene to retrieve the child, leaving officers with one option for her—juvenile detention centers.</p>

<p>If she were in a rural area, like much of the state, the chances of law enforcement even responding to a call gets even slimmer, Scott said, because they just don't have enough "boots on the ground." He estimates it takes around three or four officers to work a trafficking case.</p>

<p>Rural districts do not have much choice when they do not have the manpower to spend all night with the kids waiting for CPS to show up—and Scott is convinced that they almost never will. Those kids get turned over to a detention center, and subsequently youth court where a judge may sentence them for 30 days for disrupting the family peace by running away.</p>

<p>On one hand, Mississippi is credited with improving its "D"-rated sex trafficking laws in 2013 to receiving a "B" grade this year from Shared Hope International. However, law enforcement and professionals like Sandy Middleton of the Center for Violence Prevention in Pearl, who work to end trafficking, agree that Mississippi has work to do to stop trafficking.</p>

<p>Sold By Family</p>

<p>In Mississippi, family members often sell children in what Middleton calls "familial trafficking." Scott said it is not uncommon for him to see a grandfather "swapping his granddaughter for heroin."</p>

<p>"There may be a difficulty of a victim divulging that they're being trafficked by a parent or a family member, but I think they're all difficult situations," Middleton told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>The recent Mississippi trafficking laws that earned passing remarks say trafficking victims may not be prosecuted for prostitution, regardless of age. Traffickers are required to register as sex offenders and are required to pay restitution.</p>

<p>However, the law does not determine whose burden it is to uncover whether those charged with prostitution were first trafficked. In federal crackdown operations like Operation Cross Country executed nationwide, law enforcement often sweeps up prostitutes along with traffickers.</p>

<p>In October 2017, the Jackson Police Department arrested 13 individuals during the sweep here, charging 12 of them with prostitution and two of them with additional charges of possession of a firearm and possession of meth and heroin, respectively. The youngest woman arrested was 18 and the oldest 77. One woman's charges solely indicated she had "obstructed traffic."</p>

<p>Middleton said at the time, and emphasized her point again at the Capitol this month, that law-enforcement officers need to be trained to better handle these investigations because she believes it is best for them to handle everything, rather than depending on social entities like CPS.</p>

<p>"It's tough when you've got a kid, and nobody comes," Middleton said. "Just like a cop can't take them to the hospital; their hands are absolutely tied because of our laws."</p>

<p>More Training Needed</p>

<p>Scott is a member of the Central Mississippi Human Trafficking Task Force, but says he sources his motivation from his 8-year-old special-needs daughter.</p>

<p>"She's one of the girls, that when she gets 18, she is going to be easily influenced by someone ... showing her attention that she may not get," Scott told lawmakers at the Capitol.</p>

<p>Scott said the legislators must ensure that state agencies are doing what they're supposed to do—especially CPS.</p>

<p>"Because I promise you, I can put y'all in the Tahoe with me, we can go out at 2 in the morning," Scott said. "... We can get a child in one of these situations, we can call and say we need CPS, and I'll go buy y'all breakfast, and then we'll wait—they're not coming."</p>

<p>Notably, Sen. Sally Doty, R-Brookhaven, and Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, were in the room. Gipson killed Doty's domestic-abuse bill last legislative session in committee, not letting members vote on it, before a popular campaign brought the bill back up, and it passed. Middleton awarded Gipson and Doty the 2017 Angel of the Year award from the Center for Violence Prevention on Jan. 18.</p>

<p>Scott said that, often, CPS personnel do not want to go to dangerous locations. He gives the department an "F" in terms of their follow-through in these cases.</p>

<p>Middleton said the system works best when law enforcement handle the cases, especially with CPS' track record of not showing up.</p>

<p>"It just makes sense to us that law enforcement should investigate ... but we certainly want them to be trained to investigate," Middleton told the Jackson Free Press about trafficking in the state.</p>

<p>Beyond CPS, judges can have old-school mindsets about what constitutes trafficking, and if they are not trained to learn the differences between sex work and trafficking, the cycle will never end, Scott said.</p>

<p>"So just like the training we're trying to get for law enforcement, the patrol guys, investigators—these judges need it to," Scott said. "We've got judges on the bench that have no idea what we're bringing them. They think a 15-year-old is a prostitute because that's what she wants to do."</p>

<h2 id="antigangbillheadstofullhousetoexpandpolicingpowers">'Anti-Gang' Bill Heads to Full House to Expand Policing Powers</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-26</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jan/26/anti-gang-bill-heads-full-house-expand-policing-po/ </p>

<p>JACKSON — Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, called the "Mississippi Anti-Gang Act" one of the most significant pieces of legislation the Legislature could pass in 2018. The bill would make "criminal gang activity" a separate offense from any underlying misdemeanor or felony a person is accused of if prosecutors can prove they are gang members.</p>

<p>The new act, a version of an expanded "gang" law that failed last session, would make it easier for law enforcement and prosecutors to label a suspect as a gang member and less challenging to prove he or she is part of a larger conspiracy, thus drawing additional prison times tacked on to time served for specific crimes they might commit. Law enforcement often use the controversial threat of additional charges and prison time as a way to get suspected gang members to testify against other ones.</p>

<p>Jimmy Anthony, a regional vice president of the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators who has been lobbying for the expanded gang law for at least two sessions now, told lawmakers that gangs are active in all 82 counties in Mississippi.</p>

<p>"The biggest concern we have is how the adult gang members are using our children to commit these crimes because of the opportunity for lesser sentencing, and of course, the older gang members themselves are benefitting," Anthony told the House Judiciary B Committee this morning.</p>

<p>The solution in House Bill 541 appears to be adding an extra offense for being associated with a so-called "gang" with language that makes it easier to categorize a suspect as being part of a criminal gang, giving authorities more leverage to get them to talk or to bring additional charges.</p>

<p>Assessing, Using Uneven 'Gang' Numbers</p>

<p>Lora Hunter, an attorney for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, told lawmakers about a recent gang assessment conducted statewide. She said 125 law enforcement agencies participated in the study conducted by the Mississippi Fusion Center, a subdivision of the state's Homeland Security office and DPS. Hunter said the assessment revealed 46 of the most prevalent gangs in the state, with the well-known Vice Lords, Gangster Disciples and Simon City Royals topping that list.</p>

<p>The study itself, which Homeland Security provided to the Jackson Free Press this week, is filled with self-reported numbers from agencies around the state. The various police agencies may or may not use consistent data for who is actually a member of a gang or a small copycat crew or group of young people parroting hand signals on Facebook or popular colors used by established criminal organizations.</p>

<p>The study acknowledges that groups it mentions may not have the "established hierarchy" or connections to larger organized criminal gangs that state law currently requires for categorizing gang members. "Emerging trends within Mississippi include hybrid gangs, neighborhood cliques, changes in established groups, and an increase in the presence of national gangs," the report states.</p>

<p>A "neighborhood clique" often consists of young people of various races parroting gang culture, and studies show that many of those children grow out of the dalliance—a fact that is not acknowledged in the report, which is focused on apprehension and prosecution.</p>

<p>Leaving Prison a Worse Gangster</p>

<p>The Mississippi Department of Corrections also participated in the study, providing a clue that many gang experts warn about—many leave prison a more hardened gang member than when they went in, and return to communities and commit worse crime. And much gang activity is run from within state and federal prisons, where cell phones tend to be readily available, even as drug and other rehabilitation are scarce.</p>

<p>"The Mississippi Department of Corrections determined that 62 percent of 19,150 inmates incarcerated as of December 14, 2017, have been identified as an active gang member in their facility," Hunter told lawmakers.</p>

<p>How Police Can (and Cannot) Deter Gunfire</p>

<p>A graphic near the end of the report shows the breakdown of "offenses committed by validated gang members released from MDOC in 2017: 816 percent committed crimes against property; 814 percent drug offenses; 488 percent crimes against persons; and 217 percent other offenses.</p>

<p>The study did not hide its apparent intended usage as a support document for the new expanded gang law that would make it easier to send alleged "gang" members of various kinds to prison and for longer periods of time: "The draft bill creates the crime of criminal gang activity and addresses the problems associated with juvenile recruitment, youth gang members, the organized 'money men,' gang tactics, and allows the use of a statewide Grand Jury. It would further mandate statutory minimums for criminal gang activity and require the penalty for the crime to run consecutive to the underlying felony."</p>

<p>Multiple studies, however, find that gang members who go to prison re-commit crimes at a higher rate when they leave than do other inmates. In Illinois, the state where several large gangs represented in Mississippi (whether connected or through copycat groups) originate, researchers found that later gang activity grew more likely when the suspects were behind bars. "By the end of this period, 75 percent of the gang members had been rearrested for a new offense, compared with 63 percent of the nongang members. Gang members tended to be rearrested sooner after release than the nongang members," the report found.</p>

<p>The BOTEC report warned about the lack of re-entry strategies for former gang members and other criminals—which the Legislature seems to be dragging its feet on even as it tries to expand gang enforcement. BOTEC also warned in its "Gang Violence Assessment" report on Hinds County that keeping suspects in pre-trial detention in local jails is exposing them to gang activity, while warning about perceived corruption within the system, including prosecutors' offices and halfway houses.</p>

<p>"Correctional facilities are roundly criticized. Participants told us that those released or paroled from prison are bused directly to downtown Jackson without a reintegration strategy, which strains resources and increases the incidence of violent crime. Assessment participants described 'convict leasing scams' in which parolees are placed in halfway houses and required to work in state-supported programs, with wages being paid directly to the halfway house."</p>

<p>Where are the Hate Crimes?</p>

<p>In a state with strong Aryan Brotherhood and other white-supremacist gang activity as close by as Rankin County, Rep. Adrienne Wooten, D-Jackson, asked why hate groups are not specifically listed in the legislation. Hunter noted that the definition of criminal gang activity would encompass hate crimes, and later the committee adopted an amendment from DPS to include groups with "shared beliefs" to the definition of gang.</p>

<p>"While I understand that you feel that the language does include hate groups, you know for yourself that when you're sitting or standing before a judge, a judge interprets things, and generally they interpret it literally, in other words if the wording is not in the bill, then many of them will say well, they didn't include it," Wooten said, as she considered offering an amendment to add the language.</p>

<p>Gipson opposed Wooten's amendment argued that the only way to add hate crimes to the bill would be to add an entire list of every crime statewide.</p>

<p>"The only way we could deal with that is to include every code section in that set of books over there of every crime in the state of Mississippi," Gipson said, motioning to a shelf full of law codes.</p>

<p>The "Anti-Gang" legislation actually goes further than state crimes, however. Gipson later noted that the bill covers all crimes, both state and federal.</p>

<p>"Everything is covered, if it's a crime in a state of Mississippi, if it's a federal crime or a crime in any other state, because you have these gangs working across state borders," Gipson said. "So this is already covering every crime, and I think it's satisfactory."</p>

<p>Evidence-based programs that can help prevent and reduce community gun violence</p>

<p>BOTEC's Caution on 'Suppression-only Strategies'</p>

<p>The bill, however, is not designed to prevent gang activity, only to make it easier to send away anyone associated with a vast array of large or small gangs and groups. It shows no consideration of a recent BOTEC Analysis study of Jackson crime—one of the primary areas the fusion report identifies as a hotbed of gang activity—that warns that one of the top two precursors of whether a young person will later commit more violent crime is putting him or her into a police car or jail.</p>

<p>The Legislature paid $500,000 for the analysis, which did not sugarcoat the realities of crime and gangs, while probing for causes and solutions. BOTEC recommended a variety of solutions that do not necessarily involve sending gang members to gang-packed prisons that can, in turn, send more danger back into communities when they're released.</p>

<p>Instead of massive policing sweeps that cast a wide net, BOTEC recommended targeted actions such as the Operation Ceasefire model, which seeks to help gang members as well as threaten tough criminal sentences. In addition, BOTEC called for "holistic" community responses to gang violence and a rejection of "suppression-only strategies" that the new gang bill would make easier to employ.</p>

<p>"There are groups like the Urban Peace Institute that work with criminalized or gang involved youth to help turn them away from destructive behavior and engage in productive and socially appropriate behavior," BOTEC researchers wrote.</p>

<p>A full archive of the JFP's "Preventing Violence" series, supported by grants from the Solutions Journalism Network. Photo of Zeakyy Harrington by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>"They have had success nationwide in designing programs that acknowledge that there are certain children that are unwanted by much of society and deal with the issue directly and professionally. They create Comprehensive Violence Reduction Strategies to humanize at-risk youth and tackle the origins of and problems their behavior is causing. They also take a 'public health approach (that) rejects suppression-only strategies that fail to address the underlying community conditions spawning gangs and violence.' This model advocates for a wrap-around solution for each affected community."</p>

<p>The Homeland Security gang-assessment report gives lip service to prevention in its last two sentences, asking "What prevention programs are in elementary and/or middle schools to offset the recruitment of youths into gangs?" and "What methods do mental health facilities have in place for monitoring the gang presence in their facilities?"</p>

<p>The Mississippi District Attorneys Association and Police Chiefs Association support the new gang legislation, Gipson said, and he noted that DPS and Homeland Security have both reviewed it. He also said the governor supports the bill.</p>

<p>After 20 minutes of discussion, the bill passed with the majority of the committee voting "yay" and Wooten voting "no, no, no." The bill now goes to the full House for a vote.</p>

<p>Rep. Joel Bomgar, R-Madison, introduced legislation to implement more re-entry reforms for men and women coming out of prison. The House Corrections Committee, led by Chairman Bill Kinkade, R-Byhalia, all but killed the measure on Wednesday, Jan. 24. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Rep. Joel Bomgar, R-Madison, had a tough time convincing the House Corrections Committee to pass additional re-entry criminal-justice reforms on Wednesday, Jan. 24. Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, passed last year's Re-entry Council legislation easily through the Judiciary B Committee earlier this year; however, Bomgar's bill includes reforms that are not on Gipson's bill.</p>

<p>Bomgar introduced House Bill 942, which picks up several pieces of the state Re-entry Council's suggested reforms that were left on the cutting-room floor last year. Among other things, the bill would make it easier for men and women coming out of custody to get a driver's license after their first interactions with the criminal-justice system, establish parental accountability courts to keep families together and keep parents from going to jail for being unable to pay child support, and allow judges to modify sentences.</p>

<p>"This bill focuses on employability and re-entry," Bomgar told the House Corrections Committee on Wednesday. "(From) getting people back on their feet to getting them jobs so they won't re-offend."</p>

<p>The bill proposes adding these reforms to state law, and Chairman Bill Kinkade, R-Byhalia, said he had several problems with it. Rep. Mark Tullos, R-Raleigh, asked about a part of the legislation that would give employers who hire a person with criminal history limited liability.</p>

<p>"My concern is we're creating a protection or an exemption for the employer," Tullos said. "... But just because the employer hires them, we shouldn't give them some type of exemption from liability."</p>

<p>The chairman reiterated his concerns.</p>

<p>"I see several problems with this," Kinkade said. "... So I think we're still not ready."</p>

<p>Bomgar said he was open to editing out problematic sections, and when it became evident that the legislation's fate was questionable, he asked the chairman to at least keep the part of the bill that dealt with driver's licenses.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman, would you be open to deleting the problematic sections, especially the driver's license section?" Bomgar asked. "Just in talking to several people, that continually comes up as a significant barrier to people getting back on their feet."</p>

<p>Kinkade recognized Rep. Charles Young, D-Meridian, to enter a "motion to table," subject to call, instead, essentially killing the bill.</p>

<p>The committee passed several other housekeeping bills that extended the life of the parole board and other programs. The committee also passed a measure that would allow men and women convicted of a crime of violence to be eligible for parole after serving 50 percent of their sentence.</p>

<p>The House Corrections Committee passed House Bill 950 on to the Judiciary B Committee on Wednesday, which changes state law to conform to the Supreme Court's ruling on juvenile offenders.</p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the Alabama v. Miller 5-4 decision in 2012 that minors cannot be sentenced to mandatory life in prison without parole if convicted of capital murder, as the court said such a sentence violated a minor's Eighth Amendment rights.</p>

<p>Juvenile offenders, who are 18 years old or younger, convicted of capital murder must serve a minimum of 25 years in the state's custody but not more than 50 years. The legislation says juvenile offenders convicted of capital murder "may be sentenced to life imprisonment," but then goes on to set sentencing limits if they are not sentenced for life in prison.</p>

<p>The bill also clarifies that juvenile offenders cannot receive death sentences. The legislation would be retroactive, applying to all arrests and convictions regardless of the date they occurred.</p>

<p>Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect that the Alabama v. Miller decision prohibited minors from being mandatorily sentenced to life in prison without parole. </p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Reporters will be welcome from now on at meetings of a task force convened by Attorney General Jim Hood to examine Mississippi's mental health system.</p>

<p>Margaret Ann Morgan, Hood's spokeswoman, said Tuesday that a majority of 30-plus members had voted to open their meetings.</p>

<p>Several news organizations had contested the decision to close the meetings. Hood's office had said it was necessary because some participating organizations won't let their employees talk to reporters. The Clarion-Ledger filed a complaint with the Mississippi Ethics Commission after its reporter was barred from a December meeting.</p>

<p>Hood has said the group isn't subject to Mississippi's open meetings law.</p>

<p>The task force's next meeting is Thursday.</p>

<p>The U.S. Justice Department is suing the state, claiming its mental health system relies too much on institutions.</p>

<p>Andrew J. Williams Esq.</p>

<p>Flanked by police and civil leaders of Jackson, Miss., U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst spent a press conference arguing for draconian acts of "justice" to be inflicted on Jackson's people—primarily her poor, disenfranchised and minority residents. He outlined a "crime-fighting" plan for federal, state, and local officials to team up against those accused of crime, locking them up without bail, refusing to negotiate any plea bargains and sending them to federal prisons in other states. Of course, the plan was not so explicitly stated. Instead, it was couched in terms of "protecting the community," and "helping the people."</p>

<p>Project EJECT is apparently simple: "If you violate our laws, you will be ejected from our community." While the initiative is purportedly supposed to only combat violence, Hurst's choice of words are telling: Anyone accused of violating "laws" will result in ejection, not only those accused of "commit[ing] violence." How long before any and every accusation is worthy of the Project EJECT strategy?</p>

<p>The initiative is not original, and it is not a novel way to combat violence. It is the failed "war on drugs"; it is New York's unconstitutional "Stop and Frisk" program and all other "tough on crime" crusades. Like all of them, it will result in collateral damage to society's most vulnerable.</p>

<p>In response to crime rates (which according to Pew Research are at all-time average lows), law enforcement and the State demand more power. The terrified people hand over power that should be theirs. The courts yield civil rights and protections to law enforcement. Time passes, but crime never ends despite overflowing court dockets. The people see no true change, but law enforcement showboats about arrest rates. The accused waste away in overcrowded jails, but the private-prison industry continues to profit. The convicted are forever separated from their families, who ultimately are their best hope for rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Project EJECT is an attack on the people under the guise of protecting them. Hurst scornfully attacks the idea of bail for the accused, ignoring that it is a constitutionally guaranteed right. He threatens future defendants in his courtroom with a refusal to work out plea deals, disregarding that the entire purpose of the plea deal is a fair result for each individual defendant. The threat of sending those convicted of a crime to prisons outside of Mississippi is an insult to the families of the accused.</p>

<p>In a separate op-ed, Hurst paid lip service to the reality that "we can't arrest our way out of crime" and suggests possible alternatives to incarceration. This is not the first time we've heard this. Every time the government launches a new anti-crime initiative, it's sold to the public as an alternative to the "old way." Yet every time said initiative is enacted and time moves on, the reality comes to light: This is no alternative. The jails are still full. The U.S. still has the world's largest prison population, with Mississippi having one of the highest incarceration rates. The new Jim Crow continues its bloody work.</p>

<p>Jackson, do not fall for this. Yes, crime is awful. People are grieving for those whom violence has taken from them. No one disputes that there is work to be done, but fighting violence with violence, eviscerating the rights of the people, taking power from the people and filling the prisons to the profit of capitalists will never work. Demand real solutions. Attack the root causes of crime: extreme poverty; drug addiction; poor mental health; a lack of resources for quality education; the lack of jobs and affordable housing; a corrupt criminal "justice" system; and an economic system that benefits only the owners of capital, those with financial power and those who carry the banner of white supremacy.</p>

<p>Crime in Jackson is not unassailable, but we do not stop it with draconian initiatives; we stop it by building a better city. We beat it with quality health care for the addict, the uninsured, the poor, for everyone to ensure society cares for the needy rather than cast them out. We prevent crime by investing in education. We reduce crime by overturning and rebuilding the system, which entraps young people of Jackson into cyclical poverty and want. Project EJECT wants to fight fire with fire. The people of Jackson must reject this useless plan, and work together to enact real and lasting solutions to help their city.</p>

<h2 id="bettersansezra">Better Sans Ezra</h2>

<p>Better Than Ezra fans will hear plenty of hit songs when the band's frontman, Kevin Griffin, performs solo on Jan. 19 in Jackson. However, not all of those familiar tunes come courtesy of the New Orleans, La., alternative-rock act.</p>

<p>Griffin has had a string of successful songs through Better Than Ezra since forming the group in Baton Rouge, La., in 1988, including "Good," "King of New Orleans," "In the Blood" and "Desperately Wanting." What some listeners may not know is that he has also co-written hits for well-known artists such as Sugarland, James Blunt, Howie Day and Daniel Powter.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press recently spoke with Griffin over the phone about his latest tour and what goes on behind the scenes in songwriting.</p>

<p>With Better Than Ezra still touring, what inspired you to also get on the road doing solo shows?</p>

<p>I guess maybe two years (ago)—Ezra's still touring a lot, and we do our summer tours—I wanted a forum where I could not only do Ezra songs, but I could also play the songs I get to write with other artists in just a less formal setting. There were suddenly a lot of rooms around the country, like City Winery in Chicago, ... that were embracing that kind of (show). You know, they're about 350- to 500-seat rooms, and I thought, "Wow, that sounds really cool."</p>

<p>I started off just playing acoustic, and I kind of wanted to challenge myself to get back to doing that, maybe the purity of that. I like talking (to audiences) a lot and maybe taking left turns, so that's really just a creative outlet.</p>

<p>What can people expect to hear that they wouldn't hear at a BTE show?</p>

<p>Well, they hear songs that (are) hits I've had with other artists, from Howie Day songs or Taylor Swift or James Blunt, and just different artists like that—my versions of these songs. Usually, if it's a female artist, it's an octave lower. [Laughs] And (there are) just covers. I like doing things that wouldn't be expected.</p>

<p>When I do these shows, they're still very, I guess, up-tempo. I love artists like Ray LaMontagne and Damien Rice, but I'm not that guy. When I do these shows, I have an amazing percussionist with me, so it's a very upbeat, fun show. I may do a left turn into a Justin Timberlake song out of a Better Than Ezra song or a solo song I'm working on. So there are lot of stories, anecdotes, covers, songs I've written for other people, and you know, hopefully the songs we know and love by Better Than Ezra.</p>

<p>An error occurred.</p>

<p>Try watching this video on www.youtube.com, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.</p>

<p>What kind of response do you usually get when playing a song that some fans don't know you wrote or co-wrote?</p>

<p>I love that because, let's say a song like "Collide," which is still getting tons of radio play, I'll tell the story about writing it, I'll play it, and then after the show, invariably, someone will come up to me and go, "Man, I love that cover you did of Howie Day." They still won't realize I wrote it, and that's really funny.</p>

<p>But it's cool to see, for the most part, the awareness or realization that, "Oh wow, you wrote this? Let me hear how you interpret it." I love seeing that look on people's faces. Then, you know, there are always songs that maybe I—"give" is a strong word—but have another artist do, and they're mostly co-writes, rather than myself or Better Than Ezra. So you always have (the question), "If 'Collide' had been a Better Than Ezra song, would it have taken Better Than Ezra's career to a whole other level?"</p>

<p>So when I get to do these songs solo, I get to have that satisfaction of playing it live and hearing people sing along. ... So it's a two-way street: People enjoy hearing the hits that they didn't know I'm a part of, and I get to kind of have that vicarious thrill you get when you play a song people know.</p>

<p>The thrill never goes away. From the first time I heard my song on the radio and the first time I heard people singing it live, I still have that today.</p>

<p>How do you approach songwriting differently working with another artist compared to writing for Better Than Ezra or yourself?</p>

<p>What I'll do is I'll have a write with an artist, like I have some songs on the new Phillip Phillips record, and I won't finish the song. I'll say, "OK, this is a cool chorus idea and sounds like something I can hear Phillip singing," so I'll just get the chorus together. That's usually enough to see if the artist likes it. With Better Than Ezra, I'll have the whole song done, and then the band will arrange it with me. We'll figure out dynamics. With a co-write, there's no point in me finishing the whole song, because if they don't like the chorus, they'll say, "What else do you have?"</p>

<p>And also, you want to give the artist something to work on and (work) off of. That's when the song really becomes great. When it's good, the artist is a good writer, and they're engaged and come up with some great verse, or they make the chorus even better. You just come up with what you think is the hook, play it for them, and they go, "Oh, I dig that, but let's change this chord here." So it's kind of more a piecemeal thing when you're working with other artists.</p>

<p>When you do have an idea that you think is perfect for an artist, what do you do when they don't respond well to it?</p>

<p>You know what? You just move on. It's so often, and that's just kind of the thing with songwriting. I never get bummed out about it anymore because, as a writer, you tend to think everything you do is great. "Oh, this is a great chorus." Then, you realize, "Well, sometimes, that's not the case." Some songs you write, people dig, and other songs, for whatever reason, people aren't feeling.</p>

<p>Then, there are those writers who everything they write (is a hit), whether it's Paul McCartney or f*cking Pharrell (Williams) or whoever is great. But most of us, we hit some out of the park, and others are just foul balls.</p>

<p>So when I sing a song idea, you quickly move on because the worst thing you can do is keep trying to make them feel it. Either they feel it, or they don't. ... Part of the craft of songwriting is remembering your ideas. So then, I'll work with another artist, and I've had songs that have been turned down that I've then played for other artists, and they love (the ideas). They ended up recording them. You keep the songs that you say, "I know this is f*cking good." You know those songs, and it's with a heavy heart that you finally will let one go when you're like, "Man, I've played this for three people. I'm on a train built for one."</p>

<p>What can fans be looking forward to from you after this tour?</p>

<p>Better Than Ezra is doing a nationwide summer tour. Us and Barenaked Ladies will be playing. We're not playing Jackson, but we'll be playing Greek Theatre, Red Rocks and all these great amphitheaters, so check that out. That would be a fun trip this summer to take. I'll have a solo record coming out in the fall, and I'll be playing a few new solo songs at the show at Hal &amp; Mal's.</p>

<p>Then, I've also started (Pilgrimage Music Festival), and we'll have our fourth year this September 22 and 23, a Saturday and Sunday. Last year, our headliners were Justin Timberlake, Eddie Vedder, Ryan Adams, The Avett Brothers and many others. ... It's become one of the hottest festivals in the country in four short years. I'll be playing it solo—Ezra usually does it—but it's the third week of September in Franklin, Tennessee, and it's brilliant.</p>

<p>Kevin Griffin performs at 7:30 p.m., Friday, Jan. 19, at Hal &amp; Mal's (200 Commerce St.). J.R. Moore of Ingram Hill also performs. Tickets are $25 each at ticketmaster.com. For more information, visit kevingriffinmusic.com.</p>

<h2 id="mississippiburningkkkleaderkillendiesinprisonat92">'Mississippi Burning' KKK Leader Killen Dies in Prison at 92</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-12</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Edgar Ray Killen, a 1960s Ku Klux Klan leader who was convicted decades later in the "Mississippi Burning" slayings of three civil rights workers, has died in prison at the age of 92, the state's corrections department announced Friday.</p>

<p>The one-time Klan leader was serving three consecutive 20-year terms for manslaughter when he died at 9 p.m. Thursday night inside the Mississippi State Penitentiary. An autopsy was pending, but no foul play was suspected, the corrections' statement said.</p>

<p>His conviction came 41 years to the day after James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, all in their 20s, were ambushed and killed by Klansmen.</p>

<p>The three Freedom Summer workers had been investigating the burning of a black church near Philadelphia, Mississippi. A deputy sheriff in Philadelphia had arrested them on a traffic charge, then released them after alerting a mob. Mississippi's then-governor claimed their disappearance was a hoax before their bodies were dug up.</p>

<p>The slayings shocked the nation, helped spur passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and were dramatized in the 1988 movie "Mississippi Burning."</p>

<p>The part-time preacher and lumber mill operator was 80 when a Neshoba County jury convicted him of three counts of manslaughter on June 21, 2005, despite his assertions that he was innocent. Killen was the only person ever to face state murder charges, and the only one to end up in state prison. "It wasn't even murder it was manslaughter," David Goodman, Andrew's younger brother, observed on Friday.</p>

<p>"His life spanned a period in this country where members of the Ku Klux Klan like him were able to believe they had a right to take other people's lives, and that's a form of terrorism," Goodman said. "Many took black lives without impunity."</p>

<p>Goodman said Killen's passing is a reminder that issues of racism and white nationalism remain today. He pointed to the violent rally of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia as an example.</p>

<p>Killen wouldn't say much about the killings during a 2014 interview with The Associated Press inside the penitentiary. He said he remained a segregationist who did not believe in racial equality, but contended he harbored no ill will toward blacks. Killen said he never had talked about the events that landed him behind bars, and never would.</p>

<p>Long a suspect in the 1964 slayings, Killen had made a livelihood from farming, operating his sawmill and preaching to a small congregation at Smyrna Baptist Church in Union, south of Philadelphia, Mississippi.</p>

<p>According to FBI files and court transcripts from a 1967 federal conspiracy trial, Killen did most of the planning in the ambush killings of the civil rights workers. According to testimony in the 2005 murder trial, Killen served as a kleagle, or organizer, of the Klan in Neshoba County and helped set up a klavern, or local Klan group, in a nearby county.</p>

<p>Nineteen men, including Killen, were indicted on federal charges in the 1967 case. Seven were convicted of violating the victims' civil rights. None served more than six years.</p>

<p>Killen's federal case ended with a hung jury after one juror said she couldn't convict a preacher. During his state trial in 2005, witnesses testified that on June 21, 1964, Killen went to Meridian to round up carloads of Klansmen to ambush Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman, telling some of the Klan members to bring plastic or rubber gloves. Witnesses said Killen then went to a Philadelphia funeral home as an alibi while the fatal attack occurred.</p>

<p>The three bodies were found 44 days later, buried in a red-clay dam in rural Neshoba County.</p>

<p>In February 2010, Killen sued the FBI, claiming the government used a mafia hit man to pistol-whip and intimidate witnesses for information in the case. The federal lawsuit sought millions of dollars in damages and a declaration that his rights were violated when the FBI allegedly used a gangster known as "The Grim Reaper" during the investigation. The lawsuit was later dismissed.</p>

<p>In the AP interview, Killen repeated his contention that he was not a criminal, but a political prisoner. Of one thing he was certain: "I could have beat that thing if I'd had the mental ability."</p>

<p>When she learned of Killen's death, Chaney's sister, the Rev. Julia Chaney Moss, said her first thought was that "God has been kind to him. And for that I am grateful."</p>

<p>"My last thought on this is just that I only wish peace and blessings for all the families as well as the families of the perpetrators," she added.</p>

<h2 id="crisesinthecapitolinfrastructurecrimelabnotenoughmoneytocoverneeds">Crises in the Capitol: Infrastructure, Crime Lab, Not Enough Money to Cover Needs</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-10</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jan/10/crises-capital-infrastructure-crime-lab-not-enough/ </p>

<p>House Speaker Philip Gunn, R-Clinton, pushed a package of transportation funding bills through committees and onto the House floor in the first week of the 2018 legislative session. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>It's hard to prosecute someone for a violent crime if you do not know how the victim died. The Mississippi Legislature is grappling over that question in the new session; the Mississippi crime lab is in crisis.</p>

<p>Crime Lab Director Sam Howell told senators last week that he will be down to just one medical examiner in a few months. The state would need seven to meet national standards. In the most recent fiscal year, the medical examiner's office performed just over 1,400 autopsies with just three doctors. In 2018, the lead medical examiner might face that caseload alone.</p>

<p>Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, invited Howell to speak with senators about the lab at a Judiciary B Committee meeting last week. Medical examiners are leaving the crime lab, Howell said, because of the workload.</p>

<p>"They all could make more money and do less work somewhere else," Howell told senators.</p>

<p>The result is delayed trials, prosecutions and closure in cases across the state. Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, reminded the committee that lawmakers voted to build a crime-lab facility on the Gulf Coast that is sitting empty.</p>

<p>For now, every autopsy needed in the state, for car accidents, homicides or suicides, is done at the Pearl facility.</p>

<p>"Instead, the bodies are shipped up here—I can only imagine how that is—instead of going to this state-of-the-art facility that the State has already paid money for," Wiggins said.</p>

<p>Howell said three of the four candidates who interviewed for a Gulf Coast coroner job decided to look for jobs elsewhere with lighter caseloads. The majority of backlogged autopsies run between six months to a year old, Howell told senators, although coroners can finish limited autopsies—and get the bodies back out—within 24 hours. Medical examiners conduct autopsies all day, so they often do not have enough time to finish reports, Howell said. On more complicated cases, they are forced to send material out-of-state to Texas for additional study and opinion. The delay on autopsy reports can mean a delay in issuing a death certificate—and a delay in paid life insurance as a consequence. It can also mean delayed prosecutions and trials.</p>

<p>"They (prosecutors) usually can't get an indictment, much less prosecution, until they get that final autopsy report," Howell said. Wiggins pointed out that this also means victim's families are waiting months or years to know the cause of death of their loved one.</p>

<p>Howell requested about $11 million for the crime lab this year, but the Joint Legislative Budget Committee has recommended a cut to the agency in the upcoming fiscal year instead, proposing an $8.6 million budget instead of the little over $9 million budget the lab received this year.</p>

<p>Supporting Tax Cuts?</p>

<p>On Thursday, Jan. 4, the Mississippi Economic Council held its annual "Capital Day" event to outline priorities. The state chamber of commerce's top two legislative priorities are infrastructure and workforce development.</p>

<p>"If we can't get the right workforce, our businesses will die, so it's a survival sort of position," William Yates, CEO of Yates Construction and the chairman of MEC, said. "We have to figure out how to be innovative."</p>

<p>Top Republican lawmakers asked MEC to support them in the upcoming session on not only their infrastructure funding initiatives but also on an education formula funding re-write.</p>

<p>House Speaker Pro Tempore Greg Snowden, R-Meridian, also asked MEC to drum up support for the tax cuts lawmakers have taken since 2012.</p>

<p>"(I want to talk about this) accusation, if you will, that Republicans are bankrupting this state because of the corporate tax cuts, corporate giveaways to cronies and fat cats, and that sort of thing," Snowden told Mississippi business leaders at the Capitol last week. "And I want to remind you that MEC was very much engaged on these issues and properly so. We didn't do this because MEC asked us to; we did it because we're convinced that it's good policy."</p>

<p>MEC supported the Legislature's biggest efforts to re-write state tax policy to benefit businesses, including the Taxpayer Pay Raise Act, passed in 2016 only after Republicans had a supermajority in the statehouse.</p>

<p>"We want you to remember that; we want you to preach that," Snowden said.</p>

<p>The State's projected budget outlook is slim, and the majority of agencies are looking at budget cuts again in the coming fiscal year, as Republicans designed. The Taxpayer Pay Raise Act will divert more than $33 million from the general fund in fiscal-year 2019. That number will nearly triple in 2020 and grow to $416 million annually in a decade. Lawmakers will have to make difficult budget choices with less revenue this session as a result, and even the governor acknowledged that last week.</p>

<p>"The challenges that the Mississippi Legislature has now are large," Gov. Phil Bryant told business leaders after discussing the Division of Medicaid's budget deficit and public education funding.</p>

<p>Infrastructure Crisis</p>

<p>Despite questions of the legislation's actual impact, the House passed three of five transportation-funding bills in the first week of the session. The legislation included one bill to set aside 50 percent of general-fund revenue that exceeds 2 percent growth for the state's roads and bridges.</p>

<p>Another bill would enable the state and localities to issue bonds to help fund infrastructure in cities, counties and statewide. The third of the three bills that survived its first vote on the House floor, House Bill 359, was heavily debated in the House Transportation Committee.</p>

<p>The legislation would create a moratorium on any new construction projects, essentially stopping the Mississippi Department of Transportation from starting construction on any projects for which it has not purchased the right-of-way.</p>

<p>The group had to wait 20 minutes for the 100-page bill to be printed, and then Transportation Chairman Rep. Charles Busby, R-Pascagoula, and Vice Chairman Rep. Steve Massengill, R-Hickory Flat, asked the committee to support the measure. Busby said he was not expecting the meeting and was also not wearing a tie. He let Massengill take the lead in the meeting.</p>

<p>Members of the committee were concerned about the bill, and they made several amendments.</p>

<p>"If there was a desire to build new roads, they (MDOT) don't have the money to do it," Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, said. "So what we're doing here sounds good and looks good, and puts lipstick on a pig, so to speak, and we're the pigs. So it makes us look good, but as a matter of fact, we don't have any money to build roads—it's a red herring."</p>

<p>Even Chairman Busby agreed, saying that all five of the measures the committees passed on Wednesday do not fix Mississippi's infrastructure problem.</p>

<p>"Is it going to fix our roads and bridges? Is it going to provide additional funding for our roads and bridges that is desperately needed? It's not," Busby told reporters after the meeting. "But does that mean that this is the only swing at the ball that we're going to get? Absolutely not. The session is brand new; we've got lots of things in the hopper."</p>

<p>By press time, two of the five transportation bills had passed to the Senate.</p>

<p>The Corinth Municipal Court and attorneys with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the MacArthur Justice Center came to an agreement right before Christmas to release men and women from jail who were serving time because they cannot afford their fines or fees. Zeakky/File Illustration</p>

<p>JACKSON — Corinth police officers arrested Sammy Brown on Dec. 1, 2017, and charged him with public drunkenness. Brown sat in jail for several days because he could not afford the $600 bond the Corinth Municipal Court required. Brown does not have a job; in fact, his only source of income is his disability checks he has received since he was a kid.</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center and the MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit to get Brown and fellow inmate Brian Keith Howell out from behind bars. They sued the Corinth Municipal Court and Municipal Court Judge John Ross for operating a "debtors' prison" that violates the state's new rules of criminal procedure, the complaint says.</p>

<p>Jail officials and Judge Ross told both men that they had to pay the court fees or else sit in jail until they could, even as the fee would build each day they were there, the complaint says.</p>

<p>The Corinth Municipal Court forces those charged with crimes (even before they receive a hearing) to pay their bond fees or else sit in jail at a rate of $25 per day until they pay the fine in full, the complaint filed in federal court on Dec. 5 says.</p>

<p>Other Corinth residents with fines have also received notices that say, "100 Today or Jail," the complaint shows.</p>

<p>Home for Christmas</p>

<p>The City of Corinth and attorneys representing the plaintiffs came to a joint interim agreement three days before Christmas Eve. The agreement says that the Alcorn County Correctional Facility, where Corinth Municipal Court sends men and women to be incarcerated, would release all people who are jailed for the failure to pay fines and fees before Christmas. Brown and Howell were released on Dec. 6, the day after SPLC and MacArthur attorneys filed the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The municipal court cannot incarcerate any more individuals who are not able to pay their fees, and under the agreement, it must offer a payment program to those with outstanding fines and fees or allow them to perform community service instead of sitting in jail.</p>

<p>The agreement also says the Corinth Municipal Court will not arrest any person who has an outstanding warrant. The joint interim agreement lasts for two months.</p>

<p>The court has stayed proceedings in the case, and the parties are discussing the possibility of a settlement agreement instead of further litigation. The interim agreement does not mean that the Corinth Municipal Court or Judge Ross have admitted liability in the case, however.</p>

<p>Howell, one of the lead plaintiffs in the case, sat in jail for about a month, and without the lawsuit would have missed Christmas, New Year's Day and several of his kids' birthdays. Corinth police officers pulled Howell over for not having a taillight, then arrested him for having no driver's license or insurance. Howell was at Walmart buying bread and peanut butter for his family, the lawsuit says.</p>

<p>A week later, Howell pleaded guilty to the three traffic tickets, and Judge Ross assessed his fees at more than $1,000. Howell, who does not have steady employment, was in a terrible motorcycle accident two years ago. His leg had to be amputated, and he was in the process of applying for disability insurance when he was arrested.</p>

<p>Howell could not afford his tickets, so he had to sit in jail and would still be there without the joint agreement.</p>

<p>Changing Licensing Rules</p>

<p>The State of Mississippi will stop suspending Mississippians' driver licenses due to the nonpayment of fines and fees this year. Sam Brooke, the deputy legal director of SPLC, said when a person fails to pay court fines or fees in Mississippi the court sends a note to the Department of Public Safety and then DPS suspends a person's license. There is no process in place for asking why a person did not pay the fees or fines.</p>

<p>"(We had) decided to file a lawsuit about it, but we sat down and talked to the Department of Public Safety and the attorney general's office, and that led to a very positive conversation that resulted in them making changes in policy," Brooke told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>All other reasons that DPS can suspend licenses, from non-compliance with a child-support order to multiple DUIs or reckless-driving charges will remain in place. DPS hired staff to restore the licenses affected by the new rule change, however, and letters will go out early this year. There are approximately 100,000 drivers whose licenses are suspended in part or in whole because they could not afford their fees, Brooke said. The reinstatement does not relieve Mississippians of their obligation to pay back the fees, however.</p>

<p>Mississippians with suspended licenses due to unpaid court fines or fees can expect one of three letters. Some will have their licenses reinstated outright. Others will be reinstated, but if their license is expired, they will have to go in to get a new one. DPS will waive the $100 reinstatement fee for those drivers whose licenses are expired under the new rule. Others, whose licenses are suspended for multiple reasons, will still have to clear the other charges before their licenses are reinstated.</p>

<p>"The process of discontinuing suspension of licenses due solely to the nonpayment of fines, fees or assessments will remain in place until future significant developments occur," DPS Commissioner Marshall Fisher said in a press release announcing the rule change.</p>

<p>Reform This Session?</p>

<p>Both Brown and Howell might have avoided jail if Gov. Phil Bryant had not vetoed bipartisan criminal-justice reform legislation in 2017. House Bill 1033 would have made incarceration not automatic following the nonpayment of a fine, restitution or court costs.</p>

<p>House Judiciary B Committee Chairman Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, has already revived the bill, which Bryant vetoed due to the measure that would have allowed certain habitual offenders early release. Gipson changed that part of the bill and brought it to his committee early on Friday, Jan. 5. The committee passed House Bill 387, which will become effective on passage, if it makes it out of the Legislature and clears the governor's scrutiny.</p>

<p>"The bottom line is these individuals are coming back into society, and we want them to become productive members of society, get a job, become taxpayers, and it's important for them to be able to take care of their families," Gipson said.</p>

<p>The bill will force courts to consider a person's financial ability to pay fines or court costs before throwing them in jail as well as allow parole earlier for certain non-violent offenders.</p>

<p>House Bill 387 also creates the Sentencing Disparity Taskforce.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Opponents of LGBT rights in Mississippi enjoyed a legal victory this morning when the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would not review a challenge to the controversial House Bill 1523, which Gov. Phil Bryant signed into law in April 2016. The high court decided not to review disputes over the constitutionality of the "Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act," which predominantly Republicans in the Mississippi Legislature passed in 2016.</p>

<p>HB 1523 defines and protects three religious beliefs and moral convictions: Marriage is a union of one man and one woman; sexual relations are reserved for such a marriage; and "male" and "female" refer to an individual's "immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth."</p>

<p>The law "protects" Mississippians who hold those beliefs from "discriminatory action," allowing circuit clerks to recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses and and employers to make hiring or leasing decisions based on their sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.</p>

<p>Several Mississippians challenged the law in federal court. In July 2016, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled that the law would violate the Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses in the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>Bryant appealed, however, and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's ruling. House Bill 1523 became law in summer 2017, when the 5th Circuit denied plaintiffs a rehearing in the case. Attorneys in the Barber v. Bryant case appealed the 5th Circuit's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the Court decided to pass on the opportunity to answer a critical question about who has access to justice in this country and how much suffering our most vulnerable have to experience before they can seek recourse in the courts, but we will continue to fight against HB 1523 on behalf of LGBT Mississippians and everyone in our state impacted by this draconian law," Mississippi Center for Justice Advocacy Director Beth Orlansky said in a press release.</p>

<p>Critics have called the measure the most sweeping piece of anti-LGBT legislation in the country, with anti-LGBT advocates nationwide hoping to use it as a model for blocking same-sex marriage and other legal rights.</p>

<p>"The government-approved beliefs outlined by HB 1523 target LGBT Mississippians and leave the state's most vulnerable in harm's way," Beth Littrell, an attorney at Lambda Legal, said in a press release.</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves plans to continue to shrink state government in the upcoming legislative session by limiting spending and finding efficiencies. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>In sunny September, leaders of Mississippi agencies went before lawmakers to make their annual requests for funding. Inside the crowded room on the first floor of the Woolfolk Building, the mood was awkward. State economist Darrin Webb reminded lawmakers of the state economy's "lackluster" performance post-recession.</p>

<p>At one point, all of the public university presidents went before the group of senators and representatives tasked with crafting the state budget. A few university presidents sat with Commissioner Glenn Boyce, while the rest lined up along the wall behind them. Mississippi State President Mark Keenum told lawmakers that higher education is crucial for creating an educated work force in the state.</p>

<p>"I love this state, and I know you do, too. I don't want to see Mississippi left behind," Keenum told lawmakers.</p>

<p>A few months later, the Joint Legislative Budget Committee released a stringent budget that expresses the reality in Mississippi—something has got to give. Even a cursory look at Mississippi's finances show that few state agencies can expect the same amount of funding they have now. But this is by design.</p>

<p>The Republican supermajority plans to continue to shrink the size of government in 2018. Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves has made these plans abundantly clear in past years, passing the state's largest tax cut ever in 2016 and killing the transportation bond bill in 2017. He was not available for an interview prior to the legislative session but sent the Jackson Free Press a statement detailing his priorities.</p>

<p>"I will not operate state government like they do in Washington, D.C.; we will only spend the tax dollars that we are taking in," Reeves said in the statement to the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>The Joint Legislative Budget Committee, made up of lawmakers, adopted a budget that cuts the State's general fund by $66.1 million or 1.3 percent. The legislators' plan includes small increases for the Department of Public Safety to fund 60 state troopers who will graduate from in 2018. Beyond that, a handful of agencies and programs, including the Mississippi Adequate Education Program, financial aid and Child Protection Services, will receive the same amount of funding as in 2017, if lawmakers adopt their leaders' budget recommendations.</p>

<p>"I also want to look for more ways to limit spending," Reeves said. "For example last year, the Legislature put a hold on the purchase of new state vehicles. Previous efforts saved us about $20 million total. I would like to implement more efficiency measure likes this to save tax dollars."</p>

<p>The majority of agencies can expect cuts, however.</p>

<p>The governor's budget priorities are a bit outside the lawmakers' suggestions. Gov. Phil Bryant emphasized spending on education, including a potential plan to fund community colleges.</p>

<p>"The Mississippi Works Scholars Program proposes to incentivize high school seniors and adults already in the workplace by offering free community college degrees, certificates and apprenticeships necessary to gain employment in these opportunity occupations," Bryant's budget recommendation says.</p>

<p>Democrats plan to introduce legislation (again) to stop the Taxpayer Pay Raise Act from taking effect. The tax cuts are already eating away at the State's coffers this year. In fiscal-year 2019 (which begins in July 2018), the tax cut will divert more than $33 million away from the general fund.</p>

<p>By 2028, the full cut will cost Mississippi more than $416 million annually.</p>

<p>Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson, said he will introduce a measure again to reduce the cuts. Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, said he plans to introduce similar legislation on the House side.</p>

<p>"We should at least postpone it until we are back on our feet fiscally," Baria told the Jackson Free Press, saying the tax cut could have included triggers to not take effect until the Mississippi economy has grown 3 to 4 percent. It is not projected to grow at all in the near future, Webb told lawmakers this fall.</p>

<p>Rewriting MAEP</p>

<p>Top Republican leaders plan to change, scrap or re-write the Mississippi Adequate Education Program in 2018. Last year, legislative leadership hired EdBuild, a New Jersey school funding nonprofit, to evaluate and suggest revisions to the State's education funding formula, called MAEP for short. The EdBuild proposal suggests additional funding for certain student populations, called weights. Students in poverty, students who need special education and those who are English-language learners would all receive more funding.</p>

<p>At the 2017 annual Hob Nob event, Reeves and Gunn applauded the proposed weights that include extra funding to help students in gifted programs and high schools that have college- and career-prep programs.</p>

<p>Gov. Bryant supports the education-funding formula rewrite that House Speaker Philip Gunn, R-Clinton, and Reeves plan to work on in 2018.</p>

<p>"I am again calling for an updated funding formula that is focused on student needs. In January, a group of experts retained by the Legislature released a lengthy report with a number of worthy recommendations, including needed changes to the weights applied to career and technical education," Bryant wrote in his budget recommendations. "I look forward to an open and robust debate about the funding formula reforms during the 2018 legislative session. While this budget recommends level funding for MAEP for FY2019, adjustments may be needed to accommodate a new formula."</p>

<p>By Imani Khayyam</p>

<p>Rebecca Sibilia, the director of education nonprofit EdBuild, answered questions from lawmakers last year in a tense environment when Republicans attempted to rush a re-write of the funding formula in 2017. The formula re-write is set for 2018, instead.</p>

<p>The EdBuild proposal is not meant to be a list or a "menu" of suggestions, Director Rebecca Sibilia told the Jackson Free Press, but instead meant to be taken and enacted as a whole to be effective.</p>

<p>"The bottom line is our recommendations were written in order to ensure that Mississippi is thinking about a holistic way of not just funding schools but resourcing schools and putting the right kind of accountability and transparency in place to happen at the local level," Sibilia said. She acknowledged that it is up to the Legislature to decide how to use the proposal.</p>

<p>She hopes lawmakers will not try to cherrypick the ideas, though. "In no instance were we considering this to be a menu of options. We put forward a holistic set of recommendations that were intended to work together," Sibilia said.</p>

<p>Last session, few lawmakers saw a draft of the legislation containing funding formula changes, and ultimately, a bill never appeared. So far in the off-season, Republicans have kept their proposals behind closed doors, leaving Democrats in the dark about any proposals, but changes seem eminent.</p>

<p>Nancy Loome, with the Parents' Campaign, believes a shortcoming of EdBuild's proposal is the lack of a formula to calculate the base student cost, which MAEP includes.</p>

<p>"(That) means in the legislation, there will be nothing written in as a formula that will determine what that base cost is. It would leave it up to the Legislature every year," Loome said at an education-funding panel at Millsaps in November.</p>

<p>The EdBuild proposal recommends a higher base student cost than the Legislature currently funds but does not recommend language for legislation. The weights could still apply regardless of how much funding the Legislature chooses to appropriate to the funding formula.</p>

<p>"When there's no base cost written in with no formula, you have no way to hold the Legislature accountable because there is no formula for the Legislature to yield a number that is full-funded, so we don't know what full funding is," Loome said in November.</p>

<p>Currently, MAEP provides a way for school districts and organizations like the Parents' Campaign to see how underfunded each district is year over year, leading to ballot initiatives like Initiative 42 in 2015, which would have forced the Legislature to fully fund the formula. Depending on how lawmakers write the EdBuild proposal into legislation, "full funding" could mean whatever the Legislature decides each year.</p>

<p>Grant Callen, who lobbies for "school choice" for Empower Mississippi, believes the current funding formula is broken and wants the Legislature to replace it. He said the EdBuild proposal is more equitable and transparent than MAEP but was disappointed that the proposal did not make specific-enough recommendations for local control. Callen emphasized the importance of parental involvement in student funding.</p>

<p>"The next step is to make sure parents have control of how education dollars are spent on their students," Callen said at Millsaps in November.</p>

<p>"No one is more invested in the outcome of our educational system than students and parents, and if parents see that their child is not being well-served in the setting they're in, they must have the freedom to move that child to a better public school, a charter school, a private school and let the funds follow the child to make sure those funds are accomplishing what the Legislature intended."</p>

<p>By Imani Khayyam</p>

<p>Both House Minority Whip Baria, and Sen. David Blount, say they had not seen the legislation for a new funding formula as of press time.</p>

<p>"I don't vote on reports; I vote on bills. And the reason there was never a bill introduced and there was never a vote is because every single member of the Legislature, whether they are Republican or Democrat(ic), will have the same basic questions," Blount said at Millsaps in November. "What is this going to cost? How is this going to affect my local school district, the school districts I represent? Are they getting more money or less money? And what is this going to do to local property taxes?"</p>

<p>The EdBuild proposal is more equitable than MAEP, in part, because the nonprofit recommends that the Legislature eliminate a part of the current formula called the "27 percent rule."</p>

<p>The rule held districts responsible for 27 percent of funding, meaning the State had to kick in 73 percent of funding for public schools. This provision redirects $119 million to 53 districts, and in essence, "biases districts that have a high property-tax base, thereby providing more money than required by the formula," the EdBuild proposal says.</p>

<p>The 27-percent rule creates an "environment in which districts who could arguably raise more money for schools because of their wealth are instead receiving more money from the state to offset their costs than their less affluent peers," the report says.</p>

<p>In EdBuild's data, 53 school districts benefit from this rule, receiving thousands or millions more in funding depending on the number of students in the district.</p>

<p>Sanford Johnson, deputy director of Mississippi First, which lobbies for charter schools, said he supports EdBuild's recommendations but warned against its effectiveness if lawmakers tinker with it too much.</p>

<p>"If the Legislature follows those recommendations ... then I think we'll end up with a good funding formula that will be more equitable than what we have right now," he said at Millsaps in November. "If we start making too many changes to it, there's a chance that we're not going to come out better off, so that's something everyone needs to watch very closely."</p>

<p>Reeves and legislative leaders have been vague about what changes they intend to make to the funding formula.</p>

<p>"Through a new funding formula that prioritizes instruction over administration and support for teacher training and programs that work, we can achieve our goal to give every child a chance at success," Reeves said in the statement to the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Medicaid Fight Coming</p>

<p>Legislation authorizing the State's Medicaid program is up for renewal in the 2018 legislative session. This means lawmakers could easily just reauthorize the program by simply expanding the applicable date. More likely, they might amend how the Medicaid program works between the state agency and the managed-care companies that provide health insurance to Mississippians who could not otherwise afford it.</p>

<p>The Division of Medicaid, under the governor's direct purview, is in a state of turnover. Longtime leader David Dzielak resigned earlier this month, and Gov. Bryant replaced him with longtime aide and counsel Drew Snyder. This change-up comes on the heels of heated pre-session Medicaid meetings and rumors of a possible transfer of eligibility verification from Medicaid to the Mississippi Department of Human Services.</p>

<p>During Dzielak's last meeting before he resigned, House Democrats expressed concerns to him about moving eligibility verification—the process of applying and being approved for medical coverage—to MDHS.</p>

<p>In House Medicaid meetings in December, Rep. Jay Hughes, D-Oxford, brought up MDHS' involvement in lawsuits. In 2017, MDHS sent millions of dollars back to the federal government after not using all of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds allotted to the state. The U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating MDHS' food-stamp program.</p>

<p>"Do you think that it helps patient outcomes or improves services to transfer eligibility of Medicaid to DHS?" Hughes asked Dzielak in December.</p>

<p>"What I can say is Medicaid has some of the best enrollment numbers. We get audited all the time, periodically, by CMS (Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services) and federal auditors," Dzielak said. "... Part of that audit is looking at individuals who are on the program who shouldn't be on the program. ... We have some of the lowest number of errors in eligibility determination."</p>

<p>"(So) we would be transferring something that's working right to something that's broken?" Hughes asked.</p>

<p>"Potentially," Dzielak said.</p>

<p>Two days later, Dzielak turned in his resignation, which is rumored to be forced—not voluntary.</p>

<p>Rep. Steve Holland, D-Plantersville, who used to be the Medicaid chairman when the Democrats controlled the House, pointed out that Mississippi has the most beneficiaries per capita on Medicaid and also one of the lowest administrative costs to run the program in the country.</p>

<p>"I would just submit to the committee for your consideration right before Santa Claus comes to see you or if he does, that you search your heart very carefully before you make a harebrained mistake of tearing up one of the best eligibility systems in America," Holland said.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Health Advocacy Program polled more than 600 Mississippians about the transfer in eligibility verification and found that 53 percent opposed the transfer to MDHS.</p>

<p>"The results of this poll make it clear that a vast majority of Mississippians do not support moving Medicaid eligibility determination to MDHS or reducing Medicaid coverage. Also, the poll strongly indicates that the public tolerance for political gamesmanship with our Medicaid program is low," Roy Mitchell, executive director of the program, said.</p>

<p>By Imani Khayyam</p>

<p>"Mississippi legislators who fail to recognize that Mississippians trust and value our state Medicaid program, do so at their own political peril."</p>

<p>Republicans constantly express frustration at the ballooning Medicaid budget, always asking the agency to cut costs. The division will ask for another deficit appropriation in the new year.</p>

<p>Rep. Becky Currie, R-Brookhaven, asked both managed-care companies in the state, United Healthcare and Magnolia, if the Division of Medicaid sanctioned them for violating state Medicaid laws.</p>

<p>The answer from leaders of both companies in December hearings was a resounding "no." Currie expressed frustration on behalf of several medical providers in her district who serve Medicaid recipients but have to wait to get reimbursed or credentialed by the managed-care companies outside the 60-day window prescribed in state law—or never do. She plans to introduce legislation to force the companies to comply with state law or not be compensated.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be all fluffy because there's nothing at all fluffy going on with managed care. We've got to do better, and obviously y'all have got another contract even though your costs have gone up," Currie told the CEO of Magnolia Mississippi in December.</p>

<p>"We have got to put something in this ... bill that sanctions them when they don't obey the law for credentialing and (when) they don't pay the providers for their work," Currie said.</p>

<p>Speaker Gunn said in a statement to the Jackson Free Press that the Medicaid budget "is a big concern."</p>

<p>"It continues to grow, and this needs to be addressed," he said.</p>

<p>Declaring War on 'Gangs'</p>

<p>Sheriffs, investigators and prosecutors in the state plan to push their gang bill, which died in conference last year, once again in 2018. Tony Lawrence, the Jackson County district attorney on the Gulf Coast, said the legislation would address the state's "gang problem."</p>

<p>A full archive of the JFP's "Preventing Violence" series, supported by grants from the Solutions Journalism Network. Photo of Zeakyy Harrington by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>The legislation would widen the state's existing gang law, expanding the definition of gangs and criminal gang activity, as well as adding an additional charge for criminal gang activity. Lawrence told the Jackson Free Press that the legislation is intended to dissuade gangs from recruiting members and hurting or threatening former gang members who cooperate as state witnesses.</p>

<p>The state's gang law already has enhanced penalties for crimes connected to gang activities, but the new legislation would make criminal gang activity a separate charge altogether, meaning more time behind bars for those convictions.</p>

<p>In 2015, Lawrence said he had two gang-related murders in his county, which motivated him, along with local law enforcement, to "declare war on gangs." Since then, the DA said he realized he needs changes in state law to prosecute gang activity. The State of Mississippi still has the burden of proof in cases, but if prosecutors can connect criminal activity to gangs using the new legislation, the sentences would be potentially longer.</p>

<p>"We're trying to make sure that the law will fit those kind of actions, and hopefully gang members will realize that it's not going to be tolerated anymore," Lawrence told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Those convicted under the new criminal gang-activity charge would have to serve at least 50 percent of their sentences before they are eligible for any kind of program or parole.</p>

<p>"Prosecutors believe that if you're convicted of criminal gang activity that it should be a day-for-day crime, like certain crimes we have in Mississippi, but I don't know if we will be able to convince enough legislators to make it day-for-day," Lawrence said. "But we certainly believe it should be a crime of violence, which would mean you have to serve at least 50 percent of your crime before you could be eligible for any kind of program that will release you early."</p>

<p>A long-form look at the problems of trying kids as adults—and coercing their confessions.</p>

<p>While the intent of the legislation is also to dissuade gangs from recruiting youth, Lawrence said the bill will not change or address any parts of youth-court law, or pick out certain crimes where youth are eligible to be tried as adults. Currently, if a minor commits one of several crimes listed in state law, he or she can be charged as an adult in circuit court. Ultimately, the legislation will enact harsher sentencing for men and women found to be in violation of state law and connected to a gang—which would be easier to prove under the new gang law.</p>

<p>Research shows that three strategies work for early intervention for youth at-risk for gang involvement.</p>

<p>"The first strategy is to intervene at the individual level with at-risk children, particularly disruptive children. The second strategy is family prevention, and the third strategy is school- and community-level prevention," a 2010 research brief by James Howell for the U.S. Department of Justice says.</p>

<p>Lawrence could not say whether harsher sentencing works for gang members or if other states have tried the approach Mississippi is considering.</p>

<p>"I don't know what other states are doing. I know it's a problem in other states. My response to that would be here's one thing I do know: If I have an individual who's committing acts of violence in the community, and I put him in jail, the one thing I do know (is) he is not going to commit acts of violence in the community because he's in jail," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't need research to tell me that if I have a violent gang member participating in criminal gang activity in the streets, if we put him in jail, we've made the streets safer."</p>

<p>Many prisons, however, are known for gang activity, and prisoners often come out of prison engaging in more violent crime than when they went in.</p>

<p>"People who join gangs in prison are also more likely to reoffend and to do so more quickly, thereby undermining rehabilitation efforts," researchers David Skarbek and Courtney Michaluk noted in an article for Politico on the importance of breaking up the largest prisons in the U.S. in order to weaken prison gangs.</p>

<p>Lawrence said prosecutors are not trying to create more problems, but simply want the ability to get the people they know are committing crimes, who they know are affiliated with a gang in some way, behind bars.</p>

<p>A Crippled Crime Lab</p>

<p>Mississippi's state crime lab is in desperate need of funds and personnel. So far, proposed budgets do not include a pay bump for the medical examiner, but Joel Smith, president of the state's prosecutors' association, said they desperately need the funds.</p>

<p>"It's important for prosecutors to be able to have an autopsy completed in a prompt fashion, and it's important also not just for the prosecution of the case but it's important for a victim's family to be able to receive closure in criminal cases," Smith told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Three medical examiners currently work in the state crime lab, housed in the Department of Public Safety. Smith said the office is at risk of losing two of the three medical examiners.</p>

<p>"We've reached a crisis level because in a state where the numbers support for us to have five, six, seven medical examiners, right now we have three, and are in danger of losing two of the three at this point, so if that happened, we'd be down to one medical examiner," Smith said.</p>

<p>"So 'crisis' is a word that's often thrown around or sometimes too often thrown around, but it definitely fits as it pertains to the status of the medical examiner's office in Mississippi. They do great work; they just need additional people there to be able to handle cases they see day in and day out."</p>

<p>The National Association of Medical Examiners recommends a maximum of 250 autopsies per year. In 2016, Mississippi's three medical examiners did 1,500, DPS Commissioner Marshall Fisher told the Jackson Free Press in 2017.</p>

<p>Last year, a criminal-justice reform bill died after Bryant vetoed it, saying it allowed habitual offenders, inmates convicted of their third felony, to be eligible for parole after serving 25 percent of the sentence.</p>

<p>The legislation would have prohibited law-enforcement officials and judges to throw Mississippians in jail for their inability to pay fines; it would also clear the way for nonviolent offenders to be released early. On the first day of the new session, Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, re-committed the bill back to his Judiciary B Committee, signaling its chance at new life in 2018.</p>

<h1 id="metooatthemsleg">MeToo at the #MSLeg?</h1>

<p>In December, House Education Committee Chairman John Moore, R-Brandon, abruptly retired from the Legislature in the midst of an investigation into sexual-harassment claims, leading the House leadership to institute sexual-harassment training in the new year.</p>

<p>When Speaker Gunn's office received word of the allegations against Moore, he alerted the House's outside counsel to follow protocol and begin an investigation. But Meg Annison, the speaker's communication director, told the Jackson Free Press that once Moore resigned, the investigation stopped.</p>

<p>Gunn's management committee adopted and implemented a harassment policy in 2013. The three-page document outlines where House staff and members should report complaints to and the process for investigations.</p>

<p>The Senate has no specific written policy. The Senate rules only state: "Complaints with respect to any misconduct, inefficiency or omission by the Secretary, officials or employees of the Senate shall be heard by the Rules Committee."</p>

<p>Senate President Pro Tempore Terry Burton, R-Newton, said all complaints, not just those for sexual harassment, go through the Senate Rules Committee. Senators have not taken sexual-harassment training courses in recent years. After news of Moore's retirement and investigation broke, Burton said the Senate might consider training in the new year.</p>

<p>"We are talking about it and contemplating, and it is a possibility," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Roads and Bridges, Redux</p>

<p>Funding for the state's infrastructure will come up in 2018 after the late-night fall out between the House and the Senate in 2017, which ended in no extra funding for roads or bridges. Gunn has been outspoken about his support for plans to divert additional state dollars to roads and bridges. The Senate Transportation Committee, chaired by Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland, held a meeting this summer to look at all the options for possible tax increases and diversions to fun infrastructure. The meeting signaled the Senate's willingness to work on potential solutions in 2018.</p>

<p>Gunn formed a study committee this summer to look at the possibility of a state lottery. The results appeared mixed at the group's November meeting. Rep. Richard Bennett, R-Long Beach, said the committee was not recommending for or against the lottery but instead laying out all options to implement the lottery and including research that shows its economic impact on the state's economy and on Mississippians.</p>

<p>State economist Darrin Webb estimates that annual net revenue from the lottery would equal between $82.6 million and $93.8 million in net gain in state revenue. However, a lottery would also disproportionately affect lower-income people in the state.</p>

<p>"Mississippi is already plagued by people making poor choices, including decisions regarding their health, family planning and education (and) training. A Mississippi lottery means the State will be investing in and encouraging individuals who have limited incomes to make poor financial decisions," Webb told the House committee in November.</p>

<p>Gunn also proposed allowing part of the online sales-tax revenue, which Amazon is now diverting to the State, for infrastructure. The Legislature could also increase the gas tax, but Republican appetite to raise taxes ahead of an election year is low. Reeves and Gunn both seem open to working on infrastructure funding the new year, however.</p>

<p>"There are a few major issues out there, like roads and bridges, and I am hopeful we'll be able to come to an agreement on that and other services that are core functions of government," Reeves said in the statement to the Jackson Free Press late in 2017.</p>

<p>Gunn echoed that sentiment.</p>

<p>"Infrastructure is something we believe is a primary function of government," he said in a statement. "The House has shown a commitment to finding solutions to the problem."</p>

<p>In November 2015, Brad "Kamikaze" Franklin gathered many of his comrades in the local music scene to discuss how to further the city's creative arts. With festivals such as South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, and the A3C festivals in Atlanta, Ga., operating in the region, Franklin says he began asking himself, "Why don't we have a premier festival for artists? These organizers in Austin and Atlanta aren't any smarter than us. Why can't this be done in Jackson?"</p>

<p>Now, in its third year, the week-long Jackson Indie Music Week festival is held across Jackson in various venues. It features showcases, industry panels, award shows and other events, and as transitioned into a staple for many in the community.</p>

<p>Jackson natives Franklin Garrad Lee, and Thabi Moyo, along with Detroit native Donyale Walls, have been the driving forces behind the event since its inception. Lee, Franklin and Walls are returning for what they call JIM Week 2018, which takes place from Jan. 7 through Jan. 14 and features more than 50 performers.</p>

<p>"The first year, I'll never forget the feeling of seeing so many people at Lucky Town (Brewing Company) for the kick-off party," Lee says. "I knew that first night that we were providing something that people wanted, and that the city was going to show love."</p>

<p>Lee and Cody Cox, founders of record labels Elegant Trainwreck and Homework Town, devised one of the centerpieces of JIM Week by expanding on their multi-genre concert series, "The Blender." This year, "The Blender" is Wednesday, Jan. 10, at Hal &amp; Mal's, Martin's Restaurant &amp; Bar and One Block East.</p>

<p>A number of events are returning in 2018, including educational panels "Do the Knowledge" and "Many Moons," which features women in the entertainment industry sharing their experiences. JIM Week organizers are also expanding its repertoire and support system.</p>

<p>The festival has added sponsors such as radio station Y101 and Guitar Center to the roster, as well as new participating venues, including Spacecamp, CS's Restaurant, Underground 119, the Kundi Compound, The Flamingo and Podastery Studios, to name a few.</p>

<p>This year will also be the first to feature a gospel brunch on Sunday, Jan. 14, at The Iron Horse Grill and "The Beat Sale" at Offbeat on Saturday, Jan. 13, where beat producers will show off their latest work for audiences and artists looking to buy new backing tracks.</p>

<p>"I want slow, steady, consistent growth—not the 'popular' growth that comes with having big names or flavor-of-the-month type of events," Franklin says. "We wanted to grow this using (the city's) talent first and get folks used to seeing us before we took that next step. ... Platforms like SXSW are becoming more corporate, and the true indie artist has gotten frozen out. That's where JIM Week comes in."</p>

<p>Franklin says that he also hopes the festival will continue to be an economic driver for the city of Jackson, bringing guests that spend time and money at local venues, hotels, restaurants and retailers. And as for what's coming next, he already has a few ideas.</p>

<p>"Bigger events, newer events, bigger sponsors, and hopefully, bigger names in the indie music scene that we can bring in," Franklin says.</p>

<p>Jackson Indie Music Week is Jan. 7-14 throughout Jackson. Single-day passes are $25 each, and all-event passes are $50. For a schedule of events, visit jxnindiemusic.com.</p>

<h2 id="counciloksmunicipaljudgesdebatesbonds">Council OKs Municipal Judges, Debates Bonds</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-03</p>

<p>The Jackson City Council confirmed three new Hinds County municipal judges in late 2017: June Hardwick (pictured), Henry C. Clay III and Ali Shamsiddeen. Photo courtesy June Hardwick</p>

<p>JACKSON — June Hardwick, a Hinds County municipal judge under the first Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, returned to that post in late December after the Jackson City Council confirmed her and re-confirmed two other existing municipal judges, Henry C. Clay III and Ali Shamsiddeen.</p>

<p>Judge Gerald Mumford will leave the bench to become the Hinds County Attorney after winning that seat in November. Judges in municipal court have a range of duties from solemnizing marriages and overseeing traffic court to issuing warrants and setting bonds.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba presented June Hardwick's nomination to the council on Dec. 19, and she drew unanimous approval. The attorney has also worked closely with the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, which the mayor's father helped start in Jackson.</p>

<p>Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps asked Hardwick what she would do differently this time around.</p>

<p>"I think that I would hold JPD maybe more accountable when they're present in the courtroom with information that a judge needs," Hardwick said of the police department.</p>

<p>Hardwick also wants municipal court to start using 21st-century technology, particularly for payments.</p>

<p>Clay has been on the municipal-court bench for 23 years. As a result, the council did not question Clay, instead complimenting and thanking him for his service before unanimously approving him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clay is the kind of judge we need," Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes said. "... I remember when he first became a judge since it was majority white almost. He got there, and people respected his knowledge, and they respected how he worked with people."</p>

<p>After the vote, the mayor said he hoped that municipal judges would tighten bonds to ensure people who've already been issued a bond do not get a second one if they come before the court again because that violates the law.</p>

<p>Bonds came up again in the confirmation hearing for Ali Shamsiddeen at the special council meeting on Dec. 21. Shamsiddeen did not mirror Lumumba's request for tougher bonds, saying he wants to ensure they are assigned constitutionally and not punitively.</p>

<p>"I remember a time we as African Americans, if you got arrested for something, you could forget about seeing the light of day," he said. "The Constitution says bonds are not supposed to be used as punishment. You cannot punish a person who has not been convicted of a crime. But, we see in municipalities where bonds are being levied against defendants unconstitutionally."</p>

<p>Shamsiddeen used an example of a young person from a single-parent family breaking into a car or a house and whether or not it would be fair to give him a $200,000 bond without looking at his situation holistically. He believes "cookie-cutter situations" are unjust when it comes to bond and said he is willing to withstand pushback from people who think otherwise.</p>

<p>"I'm willing to take the flak as long as I can hold up the Constitution and say, 'This is what the Constitution says,'" Shamsiddeen said.</p>

<p>Before being voted in unanimously, Shamsiddeen said he was very close the mayor's late father under whom he worked when completing law school. He hopes to emulate the late Lumumba's people-first approach.</p>

<p>"He would defend the people more stringently even more than he'd defend himself," Shamsiddeen said.</p>

<h2 id="apnewsbreaksessionstoendpolicythatletlegalpotflourish">AP NewsBreak: Sessions to End Policy That Let Legal Pot Flourish</h2>

<p id="byline">by: The Associated Press</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-04</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jan/04/ap-newsbreak-sessions-end-policy-let-legal-pot-flo/ </p>

<p>Sessions, who has assailed marijuana as comparable to heroin and has blamed it for spikes in violence, had been expected to ramp up enforcement. Pot advocates argue that legalizing the drug eliminates the need for a black market and would likely reduce violence, since criminals would no longer control the marijuana trade.

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Jeff Sessions is rescinding the Obama-era policy that had paved the way for legalized marijuana to flourish in states across the country, two people with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press. Sessions will instead let federal prosecutors where pot is legal decide how aggressively to enforce federal marijuana law, the people said.</p>

<p>The people familiar with the plan spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it before an announcement expected Thursday.</p>

<p>The move by President Donald Trump's attorney general likely will add to confusion about whether it's OK to grow, buy or use marijuana in states where pot is legal, since long-standing federal law prohibits it. It comes days after pot shops opened in California, launching what is expected to become the world's largest market for legal recreational marijuana and as polls show a solid majority of Americans believe the drug should be legal.</p>

<p>While Sessions has been carrying out a Justice Department agenda that follows Trump's top priorities on such issues as immigration and opioids, the changes to pot policy reflect his own concerns. Trump's personal views on marijuana remain largely unknown.</p>

<p>Sessions, who has assailed marijuana as comparable to heroin and has blamed it for spikes in violence, had been expected to ramp up enforcement. Pot advocates argue that legalizing the drug eliminates the need for a black market and would likely reduce violence, since criminals would no longer control the marijuana trade.</p>

<p>The Obama administration in 2013 announced it would not stand in the way of states that legalize marijuana, so long as officials acted to keep it from migrating to places where it remained outlawed and out of the hands of criminal gangs and children. Sessions is rescinding that memo, written by then-Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, which had cleared up some of the uncertainty about how the federal government would respond as states began allowing sales for recreational and medical purposes.</p>

<p>The pot business has since become a sophisticated, multimillion-dollar industry that helps fund schools, educational programs and law enforcement. Eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use, and California's sales alone are projected to bring in $1 billion annually in tax revenue within several years.</p>

<p>Sessions' policy will let U.S. attorneys across the country decide what kinds of federal resources to devote to marijuana enforcement based on what they see as priorities in their districts, the people familiar with the decision said.</p>

<p>Sessions and some law enforcement officials in states such as Colorado blame legalization for a number of problems, including drug traffickers that have taken advantage of lax marijuana laws to hide in plain sight, illegally growing and shipping the drug across state lines, where it can sell for much more. The decision was a win for pot opponents who had been urging Sessions to take action.</p>

<p>"There is no more safe haven with regard to the federal government and marijuana, but it's also the beginning of the story and not the end," said Kevin Sabet, president and CEO of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, who was among several anti-marijuana advocates who met with Sessions last month. "This is a victory. It's going to dry up a lot of the institutional investment that has gone toward marijuana in the last five years."</p>

<p>Threats of a federal crackdown have united liberals who object to the human costs of a war on pot with conservatives who see it as a states' rights issue. Some in law enforcement support a tougher approach, but a bipartisan group of senators in March urged Sessions to uphold existing marijuana policy. Others in Congress have been seeking ways to protect and promote legal pot businesses.</p>

<p>Marijuana advocates quickly condemned Sessions' move as a return to outdated drug-war policies that unduly affected minorities.</p>

<p>Sessions "wants to maintain a system that has led to tremendous injustice ... and that has wasted federal resources on a huge scale," said Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance. "If Sessions thinks that makes sense in terms of prosecutorial priorities, he is in a very bizarre ideological state, or a deeply problematic one."</p>

<p>A task force Sessions convened to study pot policy made no recommendations for upending the legal industry but instead encouraged Justice Department officials to keep reviewing the Obama administration's more hands-off approach to marijuana enforcement, something Sessions promised to do since he took office.</p>

<p>The change also reflects yet another way in which Sessions, who served as a federal prosecutor at the height of the drug war in Mobile, Alabama, has reversed Obama-era criminal justice policies that aimed to ease overcrowding in federal prisons and contributed to a rethinking of how drug criminals were prosecuted and sentenced. While his Democratic predecessor Eric Holder told federal prosecutors to avoid seeking long mandatory minimum sentences when charging certain lower level drug offenders, for example, Sessions issued an order demanding the opposite, telling them to pursue the most serious charges possible against most suspects.</p>
