<p>by: Duvalier Malone</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-29</p>

<p>url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2017/dec/29/giving-voice-truth-2017/ </p>

<p>I spent the first half of my life in my home state of Mississippi, where I attended college, started a career and began my work as a public servant. During that time, religious views, status quo and the opinion of the public influenced my views.</p>

<p>It was not until Gov. Phil Bryant and lawmakers were trying to pass House Bill 1523 in 2016 that I realized that it was time for me to stand in my truth and speak out.</p>

<p>I will never forget that I was home in Mississippi receiving the Top 50 Under 40 Award from the Mississippi Business Journal when the governor and lawmakers placed this bill on the House floor. I received a message from a young man who said his mother looked up to me but hated him for being gay. I then realized it was vital for me to stand in my truth even more.</p>

<p>I released a letter to my fellow LGBT family in Mississippi. In it, I talked about my personal lack of support, speaking out on behalf of the LGBT community, and using my platform to support and help fight discrimination. This step in standing in my truth was very scary, and I thought I would lose everything I had worked so hard for over the course of my 30 years on this earth. As it happened, I lost speaking engagements across the South, and many distanced themselves from my company.</p>

<p>As a result, I began the journey of finding my voice within my own truth in 2017. I began taking a closer look at the community I grew up in and how it cultivated my views. After speaking my truth, I began to find strength and a sense of boldness to speak up and speak out like never before.</p>

<p>On this journey, I started to speak up louder on issues such as the Confederate flag, health care, racial reconciliation, poverty, education, economic development, Emmett Till, and helping educate citizens across the South on how crucial it is to speak up and hold their political leaders accountable.</p>

<p>The most powerful moment in 2017 was when I organized and planned the</p>

<p>Emmett Till rally. This was the moment when my journey in finding my voice came full circle. I heard the news of Carolyn Bryant Donham, the woman who claimed Emmett Till whistled at her and attacked her, admitted that she lied. I spent a few weeks after hearing this news trying to decide how could I use my voice and my platform to speak up and to speak out against this injustice. I started by researching the case, speaking with different activists and other organizations.</p>

<p>During my research, I found that so many were afraid to touch this issue; instead, they were OK with staying quiet. At that moment I was quickly reminded of Congressman John Lewis’ words to me: “When you see injustice within your community, speak up, speak out—find a way to get in the way and make some noise for change.”</p>

<p>As a result, I planned and organized the Emmett Till rally, demanding justice and an apology for Carolyn Bryant Donham’s lie that led to Till’s murder. I learned the power of using your voice for change and ignoring the negative noise that comes with the territory of initiating change within your community. I also found the depth of my voice and how important it is always to step up and make noise when you see injustices.</p>

<p>Today, I want to encourage all readers, no matter what area of society in which you have influence, to always use your voice to speak up and speak out. True change-makers don’t get discouraged with noise and distractions. Instead, they ignore the noise because they understand that they must stay the course and speak up even when it seems like things are not changing.</p>

<p>I want to challenge you all to find your voice by standing in your authentic truth. Remember this: We must never stop speaking up against injustices within our community. What if civil-rights activists like Martin Luther King Jr. and Congressman John Lewis would have stopped speaking up against injustices within America? Would we have seen a Barack Obama?</p>

<p>Keep speaking truth to power.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba appointed Anthony Moore as the interim chief of Jackson Police Department today. As a 34-year veteran of JPD he’s also a criminal justice professor at Hinds Community College and Jackson State University. Moore also holds a master’s degree in political science and a bachelor’s in criminal justice.</p>

<p>“Not only is he familiar with our police department and how it runs and functions, he’s also familiar with the trends around the nation as he teaches criminal justice,” Lumumba said of Moore at a last-minute press conference at City Hall this afternoon that was announced less than 30 minutes before it took place.</p>

<p>Lumumba said he has talked with Moore about community policing and different methods to ensure safe citizens and improved relationships between officers and community. One of those could be eliminating perp walks.</p>

<p>“I did speak to him specifically about perp walks,” Lumumba told the Jackson Free Press. “I told (Moore) that I didn't think it was the right thing to do, and I didn’t think it was the right representation for the City as well—especially as it pertains to juveniles.”</p>

<p>The mayor specified that he is not in agreement with perp walks for anybody, regardless of age.</p>

<p>“The only possible benefit that can be derived (from perp walks) is to try to provide a perception of that individual for the public for a later date of trial, right?” Lumumba continued. “Outside of that, it makes them look like a barbarian, and it makes us look like we deal with barbaric circumstances in Jackson.”</p>

<p>Moore is filling Vance’s vacancy following his retirement after 30 years with JPD. One of the final actions of Vance’s role as chief was the implementation of Project EJECT, a controversial crime-fighting plan. Under the strategy, state and federal officials collaborate to arrest suspects and withhold both bail and parole, with the goal of sending suspects to federal prison in other states.</p>

<p>Lumumba told the Jackson Free Press that he and Moore had not yet had a chance to discuss Project EJECT, but the mayor emphasized that the two spoke about ensuring good relationships between police and community.</p>

<p>Moore previously served on the patrol division and was promoted to sergeant in 2003 and then lieutenant/watch commander in 2013. He has served as acting precinct commander on various occasions since 2015.</p>

<p>The new interim chief was under the weather and could not attend the press conference, and until he is well enough, Deputy James Davis will be over the day-to-day operations, the mayor said.</p>

<p>Lumumba said they will try find a permanent police chief as quickly as possible and “will not allow an egregious delay.” The mayor added that Moore will be considered for the permanent chief position once they see how he takes on the interim role.</p>

<p>“He’s a man of few words, he’s introspective and willing to learn,” Lumumba said. “And I say that knowing that he’s already learned so much, and has so much to teach us. He continues to thirst for knowledge.”</p>

<h2 id="hindsjudgejeffweillsrwillnotseekreelection">Hinds Judge Jeff Weill Sr. Will Not Seek Re-election</h2>

<p>On the last day of 2017, Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Jeff Weill Sr. announced that he will not seek reelection after his term ends on Dec. 31, 2018. Photo courtesy Kenya Hudson</p>

<p>JACKSON — On the last day of 2017, Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Jeff Weill Sr. announced that he will not seek re-election to a third term in 2018. Weill was elected twice to the Jackson City Council and twice to the circuit bench. He will continue to serve in his judgeship through the end of his term that ends Dec. 31, 2018.</p>

<p>A statement from Weill's office says that he is "grateful and humbled by the outpouring of community support he has received" during more than a decade of public service.</p>

<p>"While the decision not to seek re-election was a difficult one," the statement by law clerk Kate Steiner says, "he remains committed to the local justice system as he considers further opportunities to serve."</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press has reported on Weill's contentious relationship with Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith. Weill testified about Smith's character in his 2016 trial, saying he felt "intimidated" by Smith during two different occasions.</p>

<p>In a June 2016 letter to the Mississippi Bar, Weill described those incidents. During a capital-murder case on May 11, 2016, Weill said, he ordered a bailiff to seize the cell phone of an unnamed assistant for Smith after it went off during court proceedings. Weill said that later in the day, Smith banged on his chamber doors, bringing in a television crew to record his demands that Weill return the phone. Weill said he received "threatening" text messages from Smith later that night as well.</p>

<p>In September 2017, Weill presided over the conviction and sentencing of Donald "Darnell" Turner, a long-time friend of Smith's whom Attorney General Jim Hood prosecuted for three felony counts for beating, dragging, strangling and shooting at a girlfriend before dangling her off a bridge in the Washington Addition. In his sentencing of Turner, Weill pointed out that Smith had not initially recused himself from prosecuting the suspect's case and had not presented all the evidence to the grand jury the first time around—evidence the State of Mississippi later presented.</p>

<p>"I'll note that now-District Attorney Robert Smith represented you in the past, and his office, despite that prior relationship, and without any effort to recuse himself from his office, presented your case to the grand jury and (it resulted in a) 'no-bill,' essentially dismissing the charges until the AG's office discovered that relationship, and Mr. Smith agreed that his office should be removed from the case," Weill told Turner at the sentencing. Smith was not present.</p>

<p>In March 2015, Weill held two county public defenders in contempt when he appointed new attorneys to take over their cases, and the defenders refused to stand down. This caused Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson to ask the U.S. Justice Department to investigate Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Jeff Weill for holding public defenders in contempt of court.</p>

<p>The Hinds County Board of Supervisors, which is responsible for paying for the private attorneys, appealed to the state's high court to stop Weill from substituting public defenders with attorneys, which brings additional costs to the board. In October 2016, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that Weill could continue hiring private attorneys instead of public defenders in criminal cases before him.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Jan. 4 at 9 a.m., Weill will sentence defendant Javondus Beasley, convicted by a jury on Dec. 14 of a triple homicide.</p>

<h2 id="editorialtimeforevidencebasedcrimepreventionatjpd">EDITORIAL: Time for Evidence-based Crime Prevention at JPD</h2>

<p>date: 2017-12-26</p>

<p>We applaud Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance, who is also a really nice man, for his decades of service. We also urge the mayor to seize this opportunity to take JPD's approach to the next level with innovative leadership that looks for ways for JPD to best use an evidence-based approach to preventing crime. Photo by</p>

<p>As this year comes to a close, so will Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance's 30-year career in the Jackson Police Department. Vance announced his retirement on Dec. 20.</p>

<p>"There's an argument that can be made that he's the best police chief the city has seen to date," Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said that day. While the City has no announcement to date about who the next chief will be, the mayor said they won't "substitute making sure we get it right for expediency."</p>

<p>We applaud Vance, who is also a really nice man, for his decades of service. We also urge the mayor to seize this opportunity to take JPD's approach to the next level with innovative leadership that looks for ways for JPD to best use an evidence-based approach to preventing crime. We need smart policing that goes beyond sweeps and that shares leadership with non-law enforcement.</p>

<p>For instance, candidate Lumumba promised to embrace innovative ideas such as training and equipping "credible messengers"—former criminals who work (and get paid) to interrupt violence among young people who will more easily listen to them than police officers. This proven approach needs to happen sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>A full archive of the JFP's "Preventing Violence" series, supported by grants from the Solutions Journalism Network. Photo of Zeakyy Harrington by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>So far, the mayor and the City approved a new police-academy class and lifted the in-city residency requirement for recruits. He has long said you cannot out-police crime, and that he wants focus on youth programs and creating opportunities by pairing city services with recidivism programs.</p>

<p>He should take real action on those innovative solutions and alternatives now to start the crime-prevention clock. It is urgent that the mayor choose a chief ready to implement evidence-based "community policing" strategies that have more officers walking the beat in crime-prone neighborhoods and getting to know the young people at the highest risk of crime. Lumumba should immediately order the end to perp walks of juveniles and the use of accused children's mugshots unless they are at large and thus pose immediate risks to the community.</p>

<p>The mayor also needs to seriously consider Jackson's role in "Project Eject." The feds' announcement of this Jeff Sessions strategy, with Chief Vance by their side, raised serious questions of legality, constitutionality and the wisdom of packing more Jacksonians into prisons where they are likely to become worse criminals and then come home. The bombastic promise to withhold bail and parole makes no sense. And sending criminals to prisons in other states with no family nearby will increase the likelihood of them forming strong ties with hardened gangs in prison to become a part of a new "family."</p>

<p>The mayor has long preached the gospel of criminal-justice reform. That should immediately mean a thorough review of the City's role in Project Eject and the likely long-term consequences of the approach. Police tend to want to arrest their way of crime, but research shows that is short-sighted.</p>

<p>The new chief needs to seek out and lead sensitive, smart policing strategies that are not designed to rip families apart, and worsen future crime, by using federal dollars and failed strategies of the past.</p>

<p>JACKSON — While Attorney General Jim Hood has not yet opened mental-health task force meetings to public and media scrutiny, members of the group are talking about how they are trying to tackle the state's system of care from practically every angle, including within the criminal-justice system.</p>

<p>Currently, 69 stakeholders from law enforcement, to mental-health care providers, to Mississippians who use the services meet monthly for the attorney general's task force. The task-force meetings last at least three hours if not longer. The group is split into six subcommittees: legislation, involuntary commitments, family support, collaboration, opioid abuse, and education and training.</p>

<p>Members spend time in subcommittees, discussing certain issues from the attorney general or sometimes broader concepts, for the majority of each meeting. After subcommittees meet, they present the short version of their work with the whole group at the end of the meeting.</p>

<p>Addressing the Stigma</p>

<p>Major Chris De Back, who is in the investigations division at the Biloxi Police Department, is on the Education and Training Subcommittee. He said he has learned a lot about mental-health resources that he did not know existed from just being on the task force.</p>

<p>De Back said his committee is looking at first-responder programs, including two types of training: mental-health first aid and the Crisis Intervention Team program (called CIT) to expand statewide. The first-aid training is an eight-hour program, which De Back said all law-enforcement officers in basic training might have to take if the Board on Law Enforcement Officer Standards and Training approves its suggestion next year.</p>

<p>"It's all about getting to the scene, recognizing it's a mental-health issue, (and) de-escalating the situation," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>CIT program training is much more in-depth, and not necessarily every law enforcement officer would go through it. The idea is that each officer with the mental first-aid training could de-escalate the situation immediately and then call a CIT-trained responder if he or she needs support.</p>

<p>De Back said the first-aid training is not just for law enforcement officers. His subcommittee is discussing a plan to create a resource, like a website along with other media campaigns, to disseminate information about what mental-health resources are available statewide.</p>

<p>Overall, he said, his committee wants to work to address the stigma of mental health in Mississippi by "addressing the stigma that it's OK to go out and get help because that's been a problem in our society for a long time."</p>

<p>Evidence-based Practices</p>

<p>Wes Johnson, a criminal-justice professor at the University of Southern Mississippi, is on the task force, and he said the work of the group is important due to the interface of the criminal justice and mental-health system in the state.</p>

<p>"It's quite a historic moment not only in Mississippi but across the United States," he said. "We're identifying the evidence-based practices that are fiscally and morally and ethically the correct thing to do."</p>

<p>Courts throughout the state have few options for Mississippians in the criminal-justice system with mental-health needs. The Mississippi State Hospital has 35 beds for all criminally charged people, including those seeking to be declared "insane" by state law standards in their trials.</p>

<p>The low number of beds often means many people with mental illnesses are waiting in jail for services, Hinds County Circuit Court Judge Tomie Green told the Jackson Free Press in August.</p>

<p>Joy Hogge, executive director of Families as Allies, is on the Family Support and Increased Access to Community Services Subcommittee and said she is encouraged by the discussions at the meetings.</p>

<p>"In my group, there's certainly been that talk about what kind of system do we need to have that's really responsive to people with mental illness," she said.</p>

<p>The next task-force meeting is not until Jan. 25, but some of the task-force recommendations could become suggestions for legislation in the 2018 session.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the State of Mississippi in 2016 for its over-reliance on institutions in its adult mental health-care system. Since then, Hood asked the Legislature to divert more funds to the Department of Mental Health and created the task force.</p>

<p>DMH told lawmakers earlier this fall that it would not be requesting more funds than last year and plans to shift $10 million in their budget to evidence-based services in the community to reduce the reliance on hospitalization.</p>

<p>The task force is currently closed to the press. Hood's staff polled members in November on whether they would like the meetings to be open to the press or not. Hood's office claims the task force and meetings are not subject to the Open Meetings Act, although media, including this newspaper, disagree. Two weeks after the Jackson Free Press reported that the meetings had been closed to the press in November, The Clarion-Ledger filed an ethics complaint on Dec. 7.</p>

<p>Task-force members have now received another email with a less leading poll asking about the media being opened to media. Hogge said she favors opening the meetings to the press and the public.</p>

<p>"Why don't we want everybody to have as much information as possible because we don't know where the solutions to come from?" she said, noting that other Mississippians who use the mental health-care system could come and offer comments and ideas for the task force that stakeholders have not thought about previously.</p>

<h2 id="judgepartiallyliftstrumpadministrationbanonrefugees">Judge Partially Lifts Trump Administration Ban on Refugees</h2>

<p>SEATTLE (AP) — A federal judge in Seattle on Saturday partially lifted a Trump administration ban on certain refugees after two groups argued that the policy prevented people from some mostly Muslim countries from reuniting with family living legally in the United States.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge James Robart heard arguments Thursday in lawsuits from the American Civil Liberties Union and Jewish Family Service, which say the ban causes irreparable harm and puts some people at risk. Government lawyers argued that the ban is needed to protect national security.</p>

<p>Robart ordered the federal government to process certain refugee applications. He said his order applies to people "with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity within the United States."</p>

<p>President Donald Trump restarted the refugee program in October "with enhanced vetting capabilities."</p>

<p>The day before his executive order, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke and Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats sent a memo to Trump saying certain refugees must be banned unless additional security measures are implemented.</p>

<p>It applies to the spouses and minor children of refugees who have already settled in the U.S. and suspends the refugee program for people coming from 11 countries, nine of which are mostly Muslim.</p>

<p>In his decision, Robart wrote that "former officials detailed concretely how the Agency Memo will harm the United States' national security and foreign policy interests."</p>

<p>Robart said his order restores refugee procedures in programs to what they were before the memo and noted that this already includes very thorough vetting of individuals.</p>

<p>In a statement, Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam said: "We disagree with the Court's ruling and are currently evaluating the next steps."</p>

<p>The ACLU argued the memo provided no evidence for why additional security was needed and didn't specify a timeframe for implementing the changes. The groups say the process for imposing the policy violated a federal law.</p>

<p>August Flentje, a Justice Department attorney, told the judge that the ban is temporary and "is a reasonable and appropriate way for agency heads to tackle gaps" in the screening process.</p>

<p>The lawsuits from the two groups were consolidated and represent refugees who have been blocked from entering the country.</p>

<p>Lisa Nowlin, staff attorney for the ACLU of Washington, said in a statement they were happy for their client — "who has not yet had the opportunity to celebrate a single birthday with his younger son in person — will soon have the opportunity to hold his children, hug his wife in the very near future, and be together again as a family for the first time in four years."</p>

<p>Two other refugees included in the Jewish Family Service lawsuit are former Iraqi interpreters for the U.S. Army whose lives are at risk because of their service.</p>

<p>Another is a transgender woman in Egypt "living in such extremely dangerous circumstances that the U.S. government itself had expedited her case until the ban came down," said Mariko Hirose, a lawyer with the Jewish Family Service case.</p>

<p>Yet another is a single woman in Iraq, Hirose said. Her husband divorced her after she was kidnapped and raped by militants because she worked with an American company. Her family is in the U.S. but she's stranded by the ban, Hirose said.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance today announced he was retiring at the end of the year today, a story WAPT report Ross Adams broke earlier today.</p>

<p>JPD's Twitter feed confirmed the retirement this afternoon: "Lee D. Vance to retire at the end of the year after 30 years of service to the Jackson Police Department and the citizens of the City of Jackson. Congratulations on your retirement and good luck in your future endeavors!"</p>

<p>Late today, at 5:27 p.m., Mayor Chokwe Lumumba sent out a statement: "“Chief Lee Vance will be retiring at the conclusion of the year. Both in my capacity as Mayor and prior to becoming Mayor, I’ve had great respect for Chief Vance. He has been an asset to the City and an asset to my family personally. We celebrate his thirty plus year career and an argument can be made that Chief Lee Vance is the best police chief that the City has seen to date.”</p>

<p>Vance told WAPT that he is planning to stay in Jackson where he helps his children with a carry-out restaurant and also plans to do security work. He also heralded his tenure as police chief.</p>

<p>"Our Police Department has made the shift to true community-oriented policing," Vance told WAPT. "Hostile relationships between law enforcement and the public in many cities around the country probably remains the No. 1 social issue in the country. We recognized that and we purposely made a turn toward improving relationships between ourselves and those who we seek to serve. That's the No. 1 priority."</p>

<p>On Dec. 7, Vance stood next to U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst as he announced a controversial crime-fighting plan working with local, state and federal officials to arrest suspects and withhold both bail and parole, with the goal of sending suspects to federal prison in other states.</p>

<p>Vance praised the plan at the press conference, which includes sending local suspects in certain serious crimes away for "a long time perhaps thousands of miles away from here," the chief said then.</p>

<p>On Twitter, Lumumba responded to criticism of Project Eject in a conversation with Los Angeles police-reform advocate Tariq Nasheed.. "Project Eject is not a city-mandated or controlled program. It is a federal (program) and was implemented before my tenure under a diff name. The new Asst US Atty renamed it. As a defense atty &amp; community activist, I am deeply committed to human rights &amp; crim jus reform," he tweeted. He added that is a program that the city has been involved with before under a different name, but didn't provide specifics.</p>

<p>Nasheed responded: "As an attorney, I know that you are aware that the PROJECT EJECT program is a blatant violation of the 8th Amendment. I understand that it's a federal program, but they need cooperation from the local Jackson Police Dept. So who decides what cases are federal?"</p>

<p>Lumumba answered yesterday: "JPD investigates crimes. They have no say so in what prosecutory body decides to move them forward. I’m committed to ensuring that everyone experiences safety, justice, &amp; equity."</p>

<h2 id="updatedmentalhealthcentermustpayd7millioninfalseclaimsactsettlement">UPDATED: Mental-Health Center Must Pay $7 Million in False Claims Act Settlement</h2>

<p>by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>The Region 8 mental-health facility that serves Rankin, Madison and other counties must pay almost $7 million to the U.S. government, a whistleblower and the state's Division of Medicaid after U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst (pictured) announced the False Claims Act settlement on Dec. 14. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Region 8 Mental Health Services must pay back $6.93 million to the Mississippi Division of Medicaid, the U.S. government and a whistleblower because the facility did not provide proper services and staff needed for its preschool day-treatment program from 2004 to 2010. Region 8, a publicly funded facility, serves Madison, Rankin, Lincoln, Copiah and Simpson counties.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst announced on Dec. 14 that the settlement is the largest False Claims Act health-care settlement in Mississippi history.</p>

<p>"Our children are among the most valuable and vulnerable in our society, and it is imperative that we do all that we can to protect the programs that offer them the services that they need," Hurst said in a press release. "The work we do in combatting waste, fraud and abuse in government programs is among some of the most important work this office does, and we will continue to vigorously investigate all allegations of fraud."</p>

<p>Region 8 referred the Jackson Free Press to its attorney, Amanda Barbour, for comment. She did not return messages by press time.</p>

<p>The case against Region 8 started after a former employee filed a lawsuit on behalf of the government for false claims, which allows the whistleblower to receive some of the settlement money. That person, who is not named, will receive $1 million in settlement funds, and the Mississippi Division of Medicaid will receive part of the money it lost as well.</p>

<p>Mississippi's mental-health system of care for children was the subject of a class-action lawsuit for several years until this summer, when the last plaintiff was able to move out of an institution and into integrated care in July.</p>

<p>The State released the long-secretive Technical Assistance Collaborative report as well, which shows the need for Mississippi to move to more community-based options for treating children's mental health.</p>

<p>"DMH can manage the provision of lower-cost alternatives to institutional treatment .... (T)he state could redeploy hospital staff to increase mobile crisis response capacity, to provide emergency services and crisis triage functions, to provide crisis stabilization services," the TAC report says.</p>

<p>Mississippi is still in the midst of another Department of Justice lawsuit for over-reliance on institutionalization for adult mental-health care.</p>

<p>The DOJ statement said that the agreement does not indicate whether or not Region 8 was liable for the specific allegations. "Moving forward, Region 8 will be subject to oversight under its Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General," Hurst said in the press release. "This agreement is designed to increase accountability and transparency and prevent future fraud and abuse. The claims settled by this agreement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability."</p>

<p>The settlement agreement is sealed, blocking the public from viewing it.</p>

<p>After this story published Region 8 administrators sent the Jackson Free Press the following statement.</p>

<p>"Region 8 cooperated with government officials and worked to address their inquiries over the past several years as it continued to provide the highest level of mental health programs and services to those in need across the region. It is important to note that the allegations related to one specific program conducted in one county that is no longer ongoing and has been shut down for 7 years," the statements says. "While Region 8 would have preferred to spend its resources on the community it serves and does not believe it did anything wrong, it came to the realization that protracted litigation with the government was not in the best interest of Region 8 or the people they serve. Region 8 admits no wrong doing in this settlement and the settlement will not disrupt or impact the services Region 8 provides to the community."</p>

<p>MERIDIAN, Miss. (AP) — The University of Mississippi Medical Center is agreeing to work more closely with another hospital.</p>

<p>The deal with Meridian-based Anderson Regional Health System was announced Tuesday.</p>

<p>The University of Mississippi Medical Center would help provide specialty services at Anderson's two hospitals. Efforts will initially focus on pediatric services, with the University of Mississippi Medical Center offering pediatric consultations through videoconferencing.</p>

<p>The two parties say they'd also like to train medical residents in Meridian, although UMMC CEO Kevin Cook says no plans have been made yet.</p>

<p>UMMC already stations a medical helicopter in Meridian. The medical center has been seeking ways to link with other Mississippi hospitals to extend services, in part to keep patients from leaving the state. Cook says the medical center is open to partnerships benefiting both sides.</p>

<h2 id="mississippistopsyankingdriverslicensesforunpaidfines">Mississippi Stops Yanking Driver's Licenses for Unpaid Fines</h2>

<p>Department of Public Safety Commissioner Marshall Fisher made the joint announcement Tuesday with lawyers from the MacArthur Justice Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center, after advocates complained it was another way that the state was criminalizing poverty. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A top Mississippi official said Tuesday that the state will stop suspending people's driver's licenses purely because they haven't paid court fines and fees, meaning tens of thousands of people who lost driving privileges could get them back in coming months.</p>

<p>Department of Public Safety Commissioner Marshall Fisher made the joint announcement with lawyers from the MacArthur Justice Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center, after advocates complained that it was another way the state was criminalizing poverty. It parallels a court rules change enacted in July that requires a judge to determine whether a person can afford to pay a fine before jailing anyone for nonpayment.</p>

<p>"These changes are consistent with those new rules and a recognition across the state that a person couldn't be punished just for their poverty," said Micah West, a lawyer for the Alabama-based SPLC.</p>

<p>More than 100,000 people have had their Mississippi licenses automatically suspended at the request of a court clerk. MacArthur Center lawyer Cliff Johnson said it's hard to tell how many will get their licenses back, although he estimated it would be in the tens of thousands.</p>

<p>Both legal groups have also sued cities and counties in Mississippi for jailing poor people who can't afford to pay bail or fines. This time, it didn't take a lawsuit, although Johnson said "we discussed the potential for litigation challenging their license suspension policy." West said talks had been ongoing since January.</p>

<p>The state will begin reinstating licenses starting in January. Mississippi will waive its $100 reinstatement fee, sending letters to anyone who benefits. Officials say people should await written notification before driving again. People whose licenses were suspended for additional reasons, such as reckless driving or driving under the influence won't get them back. Licenses will continue to be suspended for people who don't respond to a citation or if a judge holds someone in contempt for failing to pay fines.</p>

<p>"We will continue to suspend licenses for other reasons allowed under Mississippi law, and we certainly take it seriously when people drive with suspended licenses," Fisher said in a statement. "The reinstatement of these licenses will not relieve the drivers of the legal obligation to pay the fines, fees or assessments."</p>

<p>Mississippi becomes the fifth state to require a consideration of ability to pay before suspending a license. Others include Louisiana, which enacted the change as part of a package of criminal justice changes last year. Mississippi lawmakers had been mulling the change as well — it was originally proposed last year in a bill meant to make it easier for people to re-enter society after being convicted of criminal offenses. The driver's license provision was dropped and Gov. Phil Bryant ultimately vetoed the bill because it allowed some repeat offenders to be paroled after serving only a quarter of their sentence.</p>

<p>Johnson said suspended licenses were also driving people deeper into trouble because, lacking other options, they kept driving, incurring citations up to $500 for driving without a license and up to $250 for driving without auto insurance each time they're caught.</p>

<p>"We're making it illegal for people to drive a car in a state where we don't have any public transportation," Johnson said.</p>

<h2 id="editorsnotetrumpcrashesmississippiscomingoutparty">EDITOR'S NOTE: Trump Crashes Mississippi’s Coming-out Party</h2>

<p>Saturday, Dec. 9, was supposed to be a glorious day for the opening of the Two Museums in downtown Jackson, including one dedicated to Mississippi’s civil-rights history. Since the governor invited Donald Trump to speak, however, the event is more likely to attract protesters and possibly even boycotts. Photo by</p>

<p>Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd</p>

<p>I've watched Mississippi's new civil-rights and history museums rise from the ashes of a capital city that has crumbled and stumbled since so many white folks starting fleeing Jackson when the public schools were forced to integrate in 1970. For more than a year, I have just had to cut my eyes to the right slightly to see the two museums grow into the capital city's modest skyline. For months, the humongous cranes contained the promise of something this state and nation so badly needs, and that was intentionally kept from our residents for so long—cold, hard truth.</p>

<p>From my 13th-floor perch, I can also see the old Capitol where Mississippi voted to secede and join the Confederacy because, they wrote, black skin could handle the hot sun in the cotton fields better than lighter complexions. I know what I was taught back at Neshoba Central in Philadelphia, Miss., in the 1960s and '70s, and it sure wasn't that hard truth. It was more akin to the adoration for the “lost cause” of slavery commemorated at the state-owned Confederate Memorial next door to the old Capitol, with its soldier high and mighty on a pedestal and a statue of Confederate President Jefferson Davis peeking out from a hidey-hole in the monument’s base.</p>

<p>For the first time, really, Mississippi is about to step up and tell the truth about our vicious history toward African Americans. Our coming-out party this weekend is a moment that so many Mississippians, of all races, are beside ourselves over. So many have trusted the museum's promise enough to hand over blessed artifacts for it. A black friend of mine wrote a beautiful song for it. One of my former interns, a white woman who attended a private academy here and helped me cover the Edgar Ray Killen trial a decade ago, is flying in for the opening. Myrlie Evers, who gave up her hero husband to save us all, will speak.</p>

<p>But, now we're told, Donald Trump is dropping in to violate this sacred ground of truth, this moment of reckoning for a state that so desperately needs it. The texts rolled in fast when CNN broke the news: "Maybe he'll thank Frederick Douglass on a job well done," one said. And, "He's not welcome! He doesn't need to come." A stressful debate broke out between those who will still attend, and perhaps kneel as he speaks, and those who will now stay away.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd explains how race history in Mississippi is vital to America's future.</p>

<p>Supposedly, Gov. Phil Bryant invited his buddy, Trump. We've seen glimpses of a more reasonable Bryant recently, but this must have been the young version who attended Council McCluer, a Citizens Council school with "evidence" in its library that black people are inferior. He was either clueless about the pain this would cause so many black residents and their allies, or he didn't care enough to ensure Trump did not touch foot here Saturday. Inviting Trump is a lurid distraction from what the civil-rights museum finally admits about Mississippi, even using state dollars to tell these truths. Maybe that's why Bryant invited him.</p>

<p>But pandering to the powerful is what leaders in Mississippi tend to do. Bryant pandered to Trump, and most powerful people in Mississippi pander back to Bryant, resigned to the government using its resources to limit the rights of "the other"—whether to love and marry anyone they want or have access to affordable health care and mental-health services. We're not a state where progressives traditionally talk back much, but that is changing, even as it still makes many people uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Now, Mississippians of all races are supposed to show up, be polite and smile politely as Trump desecrates the sacred ground those beautiful museums represent. His press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has already insulted Mississippians from a distance. "I think this is something that should bring the country together to celebrate the opening of this museum, and highlighting Civil Rights Movement and the progress that we've made. And I would hope that those individuals would join in that celebration instead of protesting it," Sanders told reporter April Ryan on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Sanders bristled at Ryan's suggestion that Trump hasn't firmly condemned racism, even in the wake of the Charlottesville Nazi marches when he made it sound like both sides were wrong. "I think he got his statement very clear when he condemned all forms of racism, bigotry and violence. There's no gray area there, and I think he made it very clear what his position is," Sanders said at her press briefing.</p>

<p>Yes, he has. Trump's entire campaign was based on building fear and hatred of "the other"—whether painting all Mexican immigrants as potential rapists and murderers, disrespecting a Muslim Gold Star family, saying the most hideous things about women, or even by spreading the same crime rhetoric about black and brown people that the Citizens Council pushed in young Bryant's high-school library.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press revealed to the world in February 2016 that Gov. Bryant had declared April "Confederate Heritage Month," but with no mention of slavery.</p>

<p>I wrote back in December 2015 about Trump pushing lies about black crime. He had tweeted out: "Whites Killed By Blacks: 81%" alongside a masked, muscular young black man pointing a gun. That was a vicious lie. FBI data show that, in 2014, white people committed 82 percent of white homicides, consistent with recent decades. But Trump wanted his voters to believe that black people were coming for them—the exact lies used to justify the lynching of black men for decades in our state (we had the most) and various actions to keep black people unequal here, as documented inside the new civil-rights museum. Trump pushes the "southern strategy" of inciting bigotry nationwide as he obsesses about gang crime or Chicago murders—but never about effective ways to prevent violent crime.</p>

<p>Trump has long refused to swiftly call out Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists—even as he falls all over himself to tweet outrage if a Muslim commits violence. He demands that white terrorists get the, um, benefit of the doubt. Trump may make that kind of false-equivalent statement right here in Jackson, near the livestock pens at the fairgrounds where local police locked up young protesters for hours in crazy heat. And with Myrlie Evers on the stage with him just 4.3 miles from where a white supremacist who pushed the same racist memes as Trump gunned down her husband in front of their kids.</p>

<p>As always, the state that was the richest from slavery is ground zero of America's race wars. But, this time, the truth will be right there near the racist on the microphone, just inside the doors of a proud, honest institution so many Mississippians have built with love, understanding and the determination that we cannot go backward, no matter how hard men like Trump try.</p>

<h2 id="opinionbridgingthetechgap">OPINION: Bridging the Tech Gap</h2>

<p>date: 2017-12-06</p>

<p>For our state to compete in the digital age, we need legitimate partnerships between the private sector and local, state and federal agencies. Too much is at stake to expect the latter to simply step out of the way. File Photo</p>

<p>Dixie-Net, a small ISP in Ripley, Miss., offers wireless, fixed (i.e. residential) broadband Internet services to thousands of customers in the state. Its motto, "Bringing the World to Your Hometown," is fitting, given that most of its customers live in some of the most rural and underserved areas—including Potts Camp, located in nearby Marshall County with a population just below 500 people, 23 percent of whom live below the poverty line.</p>

<p>There's a healthy niche in the statewide digital marketplace for small ISPs like Dixie-Net. A September 2017 joint congressional report shows that one-third of Mississippians lack access to residential high-speed-Internet technology—what the Federal Communications Commission defines as service with download speeds of at least 25 mega-bytes-per-second and upload speeds of 3Mbps. But as a 2016 Mississippi State University Extension Service report notes, broadband speeds for a majority of those who have access still fail to meet the suggested FCC download and upload speeds. In other words, we're almost dead last among all states in our efforts to close the broadband "digital divide."</p>

<p>As the MSU report notes, lack of access and adoption are the "two ugly faces" of the digital divide. Affordability complicates the issue of lack of access. ISPs are not required to extend their services into small or remote communities that cannot generate enough revenue to cover infrastructure and related costs. Therefore, towns like Potts Camp may not have access to the most competitive services and prices that large ISPs like AT&amp;T or C Spire offer. Instead, they are usually left with a single option—companies like Dixie-Net that do their best to fill the void but may struggle to maintain technology and service standards.</p>

<p>The MSU report also recognized that many households in the state decline residential Internet service because of lack of interest or because they do not think it holds any personal value.</p>

<p>Policy makers, industry watchers and tech companies often tout singular solutions to such problems—an "either-or" pattern born from well-worn talking points, as if one remedy can relieve the pressure of decades of economic, social, political and technological neglect in our state.</p>

<p>"Both the FCC and the Mississippi legislature should get out of the way and let the marketplace bring affordable, high-quality internet service to Mississippi communities. Just because there is a problem (that) exists, doesn't mean the government should try to solve it," wrote Jameson Taylor, vice president of public policy at the Mississippi Center for Public Policy in a 2017 Clarion-Ledger editorial.</p>

<p>There are many promising options out there, to be sure. AT&amp;T's experimental "Project AirGi," for instance, would harness electrical fields around existing power lines to deliver low-cost broadband access to rural customers.</p>

<p>But the "get-out-of-the-way" strategy can be counter-productive to such measures because it shifts the responsibility for progress to one party without input from other invested groups, like local and state governments, who may provide valuable assistance.</p>

<p>The issue of adoption is critical to understanding why specific groups are not using broadband technology, and it is one area in which government agencies may be able to help. For example, a team from the MSU Extension Center for Technology Outreach, led by Dr. Robert Gallardo, has recently initiated a media literacy campaign, including meetings with residents in local coffee shops, aimed at increasing people's knowledge, and decreasing their anxiety and ambivalence about the Internet and related technology.</p>

<p>Media literacy is a necessary step in bridging the technological gap, especially the question of adoption, and a partnership with Gallardo and his team may go a long way in helping ISPs understand the rural culture of Mississippi and the challenges its people face.</p>

<p>For our state to compete in the digital age, we need legitimate partnerships between the private sector and local, state and federal agencies. Too much is at stake to expect the latter to simply step out of the way.</p>

<h2 id="whiteexcopgets20yearsinprisonforfatalshootingofunarmedblackman">White Ex-Cop Gets 20 Years in Prison for Fatal Shooting of Unarmed Black Man</h2>

<p>by: The Associated Press</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-07</p>

<p>url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2017/dec/07/white-ex-cop-gets-20-years-prison-fatal-shooting-u/ </p>

<p>In this Monday, Dec. 5, 2016, file photo, former South Carolina officer Michael Slager (center) walks from the Charleston County Courthouse under the protection of the Charleston County Sheriff's Department after a mistrial was declared for his trial in Charleston, S.C. Photo courtesy AP/Mic Smith</p>

<p>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) — A white former South Carolina officer was sentenced to 20 years in prison on Thursday for fatally shooting an unarmed black motorist in the back in 2015, wrapping up a case that became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>

<p>Attorneys for ex-North Charleston Officer Michael Slager said he shot 50-year-old Walter Scott in self-defense after the two fought and Scott grabbed Slager's stun gun. They said race didn't play a role in the shooting and Slager never had any "racial animus" toward minorities.</p>

<p>Still, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott's civil rights. As part of the plea agreement reached in May, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. A year ago, a state judge declared a mistrial when jurors deadlocked in that case.</p>

<p>"This is a tragedy that shouldn't have happened," U.S. District Judge David Norton said.</p>

<p>A bystander recorded the shooting on a cellphone, and it was shared around the world, setting off protests across the U.S. as demonstrators said it was another egregious example of police officers mistreating African-Americans.</p>

<p>Scott's family testified before the sentence was handed down and said they had forgiven Slager.</p>

<p>"I'm not angry at you, Michael. Michael, I forgive you, and Michael, I do pray for you now and for your family, because we've gone through a traumatic time," said Scott's brother Anthony.</p>

<p>The shooting angered local African-Americans who complained for years that North Charleston police harassed blacks, pulling them over or questioning them unnecessarily as they cracked down on crime. But after the shooting, the Scott family successfully pleaded for calm, asking everyone to let the justice system run its course.</p>

<p>Two months after the shooting, a young white man killed nine black church members in a racially motivated attacked during a Bible study in Charleston. The family members of those victims struck a similar forgiveness tone after that attack.</p>

<p>Before the sentence was handed down, the judge had to decide whether the shooting amounted to second-degree murder or manslaughter. Norton found that it was murder.</p>

<p>"No matter what sentence I give, neither the Scott family nor the Slager family is going to think that it's right," the judge said.</p>

<p>The bystander's video started after the struggle between Slager and Scott and showed Scott running away and the officer firing eight times. Scott was hit in the back five times.</p>

<p>After the shooting, Slager picked up his stun gun and placed it next to Scott. Slager contends he was securing the weapon. Prosecutors think he put it there to bolster his self-defense story.</p>

<p>An emotional Slager told the Scott family that he was grateful for their forgiveness.</p>

<p>"This tragic event that occurred in seconds has changed the lives of everyone involved," he said. "With my actions that day, Walter Scott is no longer with his family, and I am responsible for that."</p>

<p>The judge also found that Slager, 36, obstructed justice when he made statements to state police after the shooting.</p>

<p>A pre-sentencing report for Slager found that he committed manslaughter and recommended 10 to nearly 13 years in prison. But the judge was not bound by that review.</p>

<p>If Slager had faced another state trial and been convicted of murder, he could have been sentenced to anywhere from 30 years to life in prison.</p>

<p>Convictions in police officer shootings are uncommon in the U.S. and prison time is even rarer.</p>

<p>South Carolina has been aggressive in charging white officers who shoot unarmed black people. Four have pleaded guilty in state or federal court in the past six years. But only Slager and former state trooper Sean Groubert, who shot a man as he tried to get his wallet during a seat belt violation check, will have been sent to prison. Groubert was sentenced to five years behind bars.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst held a press conference to spell out the details of a city, state and federal law enforcement initiative to reduce violent crime called Project EJECT: Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — On the steps of the federal courthouse in downtown Jackson, U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst stood alongside federal, state and local law enforcement as he announced their new project to reduce violent crime in the City of Jackson called Project EJECT: Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together.</p>

<p>On a cold morning, Hurst explained that this project would be the southern district of Mississippi's iteration of a violent-crime reduction initiative that U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is reinvigorating called Project Safe Neighborhoods that first began during the George W. Bush administration in 2001. Hurst said about a dozen special agents from federal and state agencies have already started collaborating with local law enforcement and going out to crime scenes with Jackson Police Department officers to help collect evidence and investigate crimes.</p>

<p>Following a national trend, the feds would then bring those cases to the U.S. attorney's office to determine if there's enough evidence to prosecute suspects in the federal system.</p>

<p>Special Agent in Charge of the FBI, Christopher Freeze, brought up that Mississippi ranks sixth in the nation for murder and manslaughters per the FBI's 2016 Uniform Crime Report.</p>

<p>"That's unacceptable," Freeze said. "Not only do we have a legal obligation, I believe we have a moral obligation to ensure that violent crime, especially crimes committed with firearms, are significantly reduced. If we expect Jackson and the surrounding metropolitan area to be a viable option for our children, and for their future, we need to work diligently to reduce not only violence in general, but violence committed with a firearm."</p>

<p>To illustrate how the project will work, Hurst used a basketball analogy. In basketball, when you make a mistake, a referee will call a foul. Hurst said he had his fair share of fouls when he played basketball in his youth. But, he added, when someone fouls another player in a "flagrant" way, they are ejected from the game. For him, Project EJECT is about consequences, but also about hope.</p>

<p>"When you get ejected from a basketball game, you're not banned for life," Hurst said. "If you want to come back the next game, abide by the rules, then you're welcome to play. And I would say the same for Project EJECT. Come back, after you serve your sentence, be rehabilitated, abide by our rules, and we will welcome you back with open arms in our community."</p>

<p>When the task force determines that a suspect can be prosecuted federally, Hurst said, authorities will lock him or her up immediately in detention without bond, and law enforcement will not cut a deal so the suspect could be released in a few months. The next step would be serving time without parole in the federal system likely far, far away from Mississippi "so that they cannot continue their criminal activity behind bars." The idea is that the criminals would be away from their criminal networks and, thus, be likely to commit less crime. They would also be far from their families.</p>

<p>Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith attended the press conference, and told the Jackson Free Press he is looking forward to the "benefits" of being able to use federal courts as a resource as well. He is facing a trial on domestic-violence charges in Rankin County at the end of January 2018. Also in the crowd was Sheriff Victor Mason who was sued in two sexual-harassment lawsuits.</p>

<p>Hurst mentioned that he and the law enforcement officers surrounding him from JPD, the Hinds County Sheriff's office, other prosecutor and the FBI agree that they cannot arrest their way out of the crime problem in Jackson. However, Hurst does believe there is a "deterrent aspect to (Project EJECT)" in that it communicates that people who commit violent crimes will face harsh consequences.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance said his "greatest wish" is that some young man in Jackson thinking about getting into a life of crime will rethink his actions "once he sees what happens to some of these individuals that have already gotten caught up, who are already indicted and who are already on their way to federal prison for a long time perhaps thousands of miles away from here."</p>

<p>Hurst assured the crowd that on the other side of the consequences of the law, there has to be hope and prevention through faith-based efforts, nonprofits and businesses who need to give people a second chance when they return to communities after serving their sentences. While some pastors and other leaders were in the crowd, none of them spoke, and the press conference fell short of expounding on just how crime prevention might play out in this initiative.</p>

<p>"I said consequences and hope because I don't want the consequences to be the only aspect of it," Hurst told the Jackson Free Press immediately following the press conference."There has to be hope. There has to be hope before the crime occurs, and there's got to be hope after the sentence has been served. So, yeah, there is a deterrent effect, but it's got to be in partnership with hope."</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi turned 200 Sunday, and President Donald Trump descended upon Jackson to crash the party at the invitation of Gov. Phil Bryant. After an uproar over Trump's attendance, he gave remarks in a freezing cold room in the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum filled with white Republicans, their families, museum donors, and a sprinkling of civil-rights veterans.</p>

<p>U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., were scheduled to give public remarks, but the two black lawmakers refused, seeing Trump's attendance as an "insult."</p>

<p>Myrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers who was also outspoken about Trump's presence, slid into the room at the last minute before remarks began. Her brother-in-law, Charles Evers, a Trump supporter, along with the mayor of Vicksburg, George Flaggs, arrived shortly before Evers—the two men had greeted Trump on the tarmac at the Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers Airport. Reuben Anderson, the first black judge on the Mississippi Supreme Court and former NAACP defense counsel, opened the private ceremony, and delivered shortened remarks so as not to keep the president waiting. The program was delayed by about 30 minutes because the icy weather had slowed down Air Force One's arrival.</p>

<p>"This is a great day that we have, and we waited a long time for it," Anderson said, adding that it took a lot of "arm twisting and soul searching" to get the museums erected. He said that he had taken the president on a brief tour of the museum and showed him the photograph of Vernon Dahmer's four sons looking at his burned-out home after their father was murdered. Klansmen firebombed Dahmer's home when he and his wife were inside. Vernon, a civil rights activist, did not survive long after the incident.</p>

<p>"That story, as I told the president, "Anderson said, "tells a lot about Mississippi. We've been through a whole lot, we've seen a whole lot, but we're a forgiving and loving state."</p>

<p>Anderson made time to thank Gov. Phil Bryant not only for being "out front and pushing these museums from day one," but also for inviting the president to attend the museum opening.</p>

<p>Then the governor approached the mic and the crowd applauded him as he shouted out "good morning" and other pleasantries. He expressed how proud he was that the president as well as Dr. Ben Carson, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, had come to the private event. Notably, in his White House-appointed position, Carson referred to poverty as a "state of mind" and said that those in the transatlantic slave trade were part of the immigrant story.</p>

<p>Though she did not get a formal shout-out and could mainly be seen around the perimeters, former contestant on "The Apprentice," Omarosa Manigault, was also there. She was Trump's director of African American outreach during his campaign and now holds the title of director of communications for the Office of the Public Liaison.</p>

<p>Bryant continued Anderson's sentiments of not wanting to keep the president long nor the people who sat outside in the cold waiting for the private ceremony to be finished so that the official programming could begin.</p>

<p>"Two hundred years and the president of the United States is here to talk about our museum and our history," Gov. Bryant said about the state's bicentennial before introducing his "friend," the 45th president.</p>

<p>President Trump entered the room with enormous applause and a standing ovation as "Hail to the Chief" played over the loudspeakers. He began with expressing his love for Mississippi, "a great place," and thanked the governor for the introduction and "honoring him with the invitation." He thanked Anderson, "a great man with a great reputation, even outside of the state of Mississippi," Trump said.</p>

<p>Trump opened with talking about how extraordinary these museums are, and nodded to Gov. Bryant's "great legacy" in making them happen.</p>

<p>"The Civil Rights Museum records the oppression, cruelty and injustice inflicted on the African American community, the fight to end slavery, to break down Jim Crow, to end segregation, to gain the right to vote, and to achieve the sacred birthright of equality here," the president said. "And that's big stuff. That's big stuff. Those are very big phrases. Very big words."</p>

<p>Trump briefly spoke about Martin Luther King Jr., James Meredith and the Jackson Public Library sit-ins in 1961 before anchoring his speech in the history and legacy of Medgar Evers, whom a white supremacist killed in Jackson in 1963.</p>

<p>"We are deeply privileged to be joined today by his incredible widow—somebody that's loved throughout large sections of our country—beyond this area," Trump said. " So I just want to say hello to Myrlie. Myrlie. Where is Myrlie?" He paused to search the crowd for her, while the audience applauded and stood for her.</p>

<p>Earlier that week, Evers told The New York Times that "if God gives me the breath and the strength" she would address his attendance, although she did not speak at the private event nor did she mention him by name in any of her later remarks.</p>

<p>The president continued on script, clearly reading directly from prepared remarks, and closed by thanking the "great governor" again. He briefly shook people's hands in the front row before being whisked away to re-board Air Force One just one hour after touching down in Jackson to return to his hotel in West Palm Beach, Fla.</p>

<p>CORRECTION: a previous version of the story mistakenly listed Vernon Dahmer as a lawyer. We apologize for the error.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The House of Representatives is one member shy of a full house, after a series of retirements and resignations in the off-season.</p>

<p>On Monday, House Speaker Philip Gunn, R-Clinton, swore in new representatives Cheikh Taylor and Kevin Ford. Taylor replaces Democratic Rep. Tyrone Ellis, who retired after the 2017 legislative session. Ford replaces Republican Alex Monsour, who resigned after he was elected to the Vicksburg Board of Aldermen.</p>

<p>Taylor is the executive director of the Brickfire Project, a nonprofit child-centered organization that includes a daycare and after-school programs, a press release from the House says. Ford works in insurance at the Ford Insurance Agency he established with his wife in Vicksburg.</p>

<p>Taylor and Ford join Missy McGee and Stacey Wilkes as the new representatives in the House in the upcoming session. McGee, a former legislative assistant to former U.S. Majority Leader Trent Lott, replaced now-Mayor Toby Barker to represent Hattiesburg. Wilkes, a member of the Mississippi Republican Party State Executive Committee, replaced Mark Formby, now a part of the Worker's Compensation Commission.</p>

<p>The abrupt retirement of Rep. John Moore's, he claimed was due to health issues, leaves one more empty seat in the House. But, Moore actually retired amid sexual harassment allegations, the speaker's office confirmed on Monday.</p>

<p>Meg Annison, director of communications for Gunn's office, said when the speaker received the allegations, he alerted outside counsel and followed their protocol to begin an investigation. Gunn did not speak specifically to the victims who came forward. Moore told several media outlets that the investigation blindsided, and said Moore knew about the investigation, the AP reported. Gunn told the AP that Moore's resignation ended the House's inquiry into the allegations and that any further claims would need to be pursued in court.</p>

<p>The House is now missing a Rankin County representative, and Gov. Phil Bryant will have to set a date for the special election to replace him. Moore chaired the House Education Committee, a crucial committee in the upcoming session if an education formula re-write is possible. Annison said the speaker hopes to name a new chairperson before the session.</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves also swore in Neil Whaley on Monday, who flipped the formerly Democratic seat held by Sen. Bill Stone, the Senate minority whip.</p>

<h2 id="thisisourstatemuseumsopeningmakesandbreakspeace">‘This Is Our State’: Museums’ Opening Makes and Breaks Peace</h2>

<p>by: Cheree Franco</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-13</p>

<p>Charlie Davis, a 9-year-old from West Point, Miss., read the panel outside an Emmett Till exhibit not long after the doors of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum opened Saturday, Dec. 9, 2017.</p>

<p>When he got to the details of Till's death, he stopped, looked at his aunt, and said, "What?"</p>

<p>"That little boy right there," Lakenshia Davis said, pointing to Till's photo. "They found his corpse in the river."</p>

<p>Nearby, Charlie's grandmother, Willie Davis, studied a photo taken inside the all-white West Point High School. Post-integration, she taught at the school for 31 years.</p>

<p>When she was in seventh grade, Willie was one of about 20 black students to integrate the old Terry High School. "I went to class, and the first thing that the teacher would do was move my chair away from everybody else's. But one day I went Rosa Parks on her. I was like, 'I'm not moving,'" she said.</p>

<p>Willie spent the rest of that day in the principal's office. But her recollection is a metaphor of opening day of the first state-funded civil-rights museum in the United States—survivors recounting stories, fighters taking principled stands.</p>

<p>Shining a Light</p>

<p>As the outdoor opening ceremony of the state's 2 Museums—the Museum of Mississippi History and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum—drew to a close about a half hour behind schedule, the band on the big stage in Entergy Plaza played to about a dozen people and 2,500 empty chairs. The museum itself bustled as people with the first tickets streamed through the doors.</p>

<p>Volunteers shepherded visitors through the starburst interior—rooms showcasing different eras of the state's black oppression, spiraling out from a ribbon sculpture called "This Little Light of Mine," in honor of activist Fannie Lou Hamer. (It was the former sharecropper's favorite song even before she became a major figure in Mississippi's civil-rights battle in the 1960s.)</p>

<p>By then, President Donald Trump was back in the air headed to Florida after appearing briefly behind closed doors in the civil-rights museum's small auditorium. He had spoken to a mostly white audience that included Republican leaders, as well as Myrlie Evers, the widow of slain activist Medgar Evers, and a few other civil-rights veterans.</p>

<p>The real excitement happened when the doors of the museums opened to an excited and curious public. Many of the visitors to the civil-rights museum—most of them black—had driven hours, from all corners of Mississippi. And the educating and reminiscing began immediately.</p>

<p>'This Is Our State'</p>

<p>Flonzie Brown-Wright, 75, attended the public opening ceremony, even though she was angry that the governor had invited Trump. Brown-Wright is featured in the new museum. In 1968, when she won the position of Madison County election commissioner, she became the first black woman to hold office in Mississippi since Reconstruction ended black people's short-term ability to run for and serve public office in the state. Brown-Wright views the museum as "a validation of our struggle," she said at the ceremony. "I've been to jail, been tear-gassed, been shot at, had my life threatened, the lives of my children threatened just for the right to vote. ... And some didn't live through it."</p>

<p>The summer Emmett Till died, two of her cousins were dragged to death behind a truck.</p>

<p>"Quantico" actress and native Mississippian Aunjanue Ellis first learned of the museum in 2013, when the Jackson Free Press published pictures of the ground-breaking.</p>

<p>"While Mrs. Evers was speaking, they had Confederate flags all over," Ellis said at the museum opening. "So that immediately set the standard for what the people behind the museum were trying to achieve." A Mississippi flag, with the Confederate battle emblem in its canton, flew next to the stage then, but this day no state flags were visible on the museum grounds.</p>

<p>The new civil-rights museum immediately drew skepticism after plans for the $90-million museum duo were announced in 2013. Myrlie Evers addressed her initial doubts when she spoke at the opening ceremony before the doors officially opened.</p>

<p>"When I first heard of the concept of two museums, I immediately thought, are we going back to our old practices? Are we having two separate but possibly equal museums?"</p>

<p>But, still, Evers had already decided to trust the Mississippi Department of Archives and History with her late husband Medgar Evers' papers. This lent legitimacy to the museum, and many Mississippians were hopeful that the official state narrative would be truthful.</p>

<p>Then came Trump, whose visit went public five days before the opening, sending organizers scrambling amid strong outcry against his speaking.</p>

<p>"I guess he was invited by our governor, so he can come, but at the same time, we realize things that he's done have not demonstrated a love for our people. ... He's not a real advocate," Mary Ann Hudson of Prentiss, who had worked with Medgar Evers on voting registration, said Saturday.</p>

<p>Laurie Bertram Roberts, the African American head of Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, only sees sinister motives in Phil Bryant's surprise invitation. "It's so odd to me that our government can't see that these people are family members, are people's friends and aunties and uncles. ... These are our elders. To invite Donald Trump to a sacred place honoring people who protested people like Donald Trump?"</p>

<p>It's a bully move, Jacqueline Amos-Norris, chairwoman of the Mississippi Association of County Democrats, said. "I honestly think that was (Bryant's) way of reminding us that he has the power. ... But we let him know that we do 'know our place.' This is our state. This is the state of the people."</p>

<p>'He's a Peace-breaker'</p>

<p>A day after the announcement, a coalition of groups—among them Mississippi Pantsuit Nation, Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund and Indivisible Jackson—organized a protest along what they expected to be the presidential motorcade. In the end, Trump managed to evade the protestors, but national media took notice.</p>

<p>Civil-rights leaders and Democratic politicians, such as Reps. John Lewis and Bennie Thompson and former Gov. Ray Mabus boycotted the state-sponsored event, and Mayor Chokwe Lumumba scheduled an alternative event featuring NAACP leaders.</p>

<p>Ellis started a hashtag, #theSameMen, to call attention to the fact that the same men who funded the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum—state legislators—are the ones who refuse to remove Confederate symbols from the state flag.</p>

<p>"It's not just a symbol of violence, it's an instruction to commit violence," Ellis said Saturday.</p>

<p>When officials learned of the protest, the president's speech was shuffled from outside to in, accessible only to donors, politicians and civil-rights veterans (some of whom, like Attorney General Jim Hood and the family of Klan-murdered voters' rights activist Vernon Dahmer, chose not to attend).</p>

<p>A public event to celebrate unity became divisive, exclusive and fractured. Throughout the morning, about 200 protesters lined High Street, holding handmade signs. They included black and white people, able-bodied and disabled-bodied people, a brain-cancer patient, a health-care advocate from Los Angeles and a Jewish scholar from New Jersey.</p>

<p>"Yesterday he gives a whole speech about Roy Moore again, and now he's coming here? He's got to be kidding. I'm angry as hell, so here I am," Steven Goldstein, 55, said.</p>

<p>Taxi drivers, fire trucks and garbage collectors honked in solidarity as they passed the group.</p>

<p>"He's not a peacemaker, he's a peace-breaker," protester Marietta Carter, 61, of Clinton said, standing next to High Street.</p>

<p>True Trump Supporter</p>

<p>At the official ceremony, Myrlie Evers spoke, not mentioning Trump's name but warning that the climate of hate is similar today as when her husband was gunned down.</p>

<p>"Today we are being challenged almost as most as we were when Medgar Evers was alive," she said to applause.</p>

<p>Former Gov. William Winter, a white Democrat who has led racial reconciliation and education reform in the state, said he wanted the facilities to bring people together in healing.</p>

<p>"These two museums will challenge all of us to have a better understanding of where we've come from," he said.</p>

<p>Gov. Bryant spoke twice, sounding like a true friend of civil rights, despite his track record of angering black Mississippians. "I am certain we would not celebrate this momentous occasion today without the contributions of everyone recognized in these historic exhibits—the men and women, white and black, who poured themselves into making Mississippi a better place for our people," Bryant said—his phrasing seeming to betray a bias.</p>

<p>Some African Americans defended Bryant's decision to invite Trump.</p>

<p>"Governor Bryant is a true supporter of Trump. Although we don't agree with all of his ideas, we just have to say that he is the president of the U.S., and if he comes to Mississippi and brings more energy to this overall goal, then that's fine," local businessman Leroy Walker, 67, said.</p>

<p>It was not fine to Amos-Norris.</p>

<p>"President Trump's whole agenda, the only people that he does not hate, are white males in leadership," she said. "As far as he's concerned, we don't exist—women, people of color."</p>

<p>After the official ceremony, the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund sponsored a unity event with food and music at The Iron Horse Grill in downtown Jackson.</p>

<p>Lori Gregory, a white protest organizer originally from the Mississippi Delta town of Panther Burn, tried to process the day and its place in her personal journey, which included earning a master's in social work at the historically black Jackson State University. "I directly contradict the GOP narrative," Gregory said.</p>

<p>"If I can grow up on a cotton plantation, and at 22, JSU can shoot me out, and I'm an activist? That's education. That's understanding what white supremacy is, and that's understanding that I have a part in it, and therefore a part in cleaning it up."</p>

<p>"Sunday will be a new day," Roberts said. "Phil Bryant will go back to his office, and he'll probably never show his face at the museum again. And Donald Trump will go on back to Mar-a-Lago and golf. And we'll still be here, on the ground, taking our kids and our grandkids to the museum."</p>

<p>Kids bundled up in parkas, one wearing a red "Make America Great Again" cap, leaned against the railing at the Allen C. Thompson Field Air National Guard base; another read Harry Potter while she waited for President Donald Trump to touch down in Jackson. Family and friends of Mississippi National Guard and government workers gathered to greet Trump. Snow still glistened in the sun in fields beyond the runway as snipers climbed up the sides of two of the hangars on the base. Two of Trump's schedulers climbed up on the reporter hitch.</p>

<p>"Looks good, looks really good," one of them said, surveying the tarmac.</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant, first lady Deborah Bryant, Sen. Roger Wicker, Rep. Gregg Harper, Vicksburg Mayor George Flaggs, Pascagoula Mayor Dane Maxwell, and Medgar Evers' brother and Trump supporter Charles Evers arrived at the tarmac at 10:05 a.m. to greet the president.</p>

<p>At 10:13 a.m., Air Force One landed. Trump emerged from the plane to the sound of muffled cheers from the supporters over the sound of the plane's engine.</p>

<p>Trump waved, then fist-bumped the air a few times before descending the stairs. The president spent a little more than two minutes working his way down the line of greeters. Trump then blew a kiss, threw up a fist and got in the car with the Bryants to ride downtown to the two museums.</p>

<p>A 'Full-fledged Agitator'</p>

<p>Across town at the Smith Robertson Museum and Cultural Center, formerly Jackson's first public school built for African Americans, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and the national president of the NAACP, Mississippian Derrick Johnson, hosted an alternative event to honor civil-rights veterans in the wake of Trump's intrusion. They followed the lead of U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who were scheduled to give public remarks, but refused, seeing Trump's attendance as an "insult," their joint statement said.</p>

<p>A collection of stories about the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History opening in December 2017.</p>

<p>Civil-rights veterans remained on the stage throughout the event. Dr. Robert Smith, who cared for movement activists and others who had no access to health care, took the stage. So did Amos C. Brown, the president of the San Francisco branch of the NAACP, whose words brought people to their feet.</p>

<p>Brown, a Jackson native, attended Smith Robertson for elementary school. During his remarks, he read from the file the Mississippi Sovereignty Commission kept on him that labelled him as a "full-fledged agitator." He said seeing the mutilated head of Emmett Till in Jet Magazine in 1955 launched him into a life of activism. He ran to Medgar Evers, the newly appointed field secretary for the Mississippi branch of the NAACP, who encouraged Brown to organize a youth council for the NAACP, the first for the association.</p>

<p>In 1956, Evers drove Brown to the NAACP national convention in San Francisco where he met Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks, A. Philip Randolph and many other iconic civil-rights leaders, he said. Brown shared a line of King's speech at that conference: "I have a dream that the day will come that all of God's children, from bass black to treble white, will be significant on the Constitution's keyboard."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, since one Donald Trump made it to that White House, we are not experiencing concord, we are not experiencing harmony," Brown said. "But, we have experienced the jangling discords of hate, discrimination, misogyny, and all of the '-isms' that have divided this nation."</p>

<p>Lumumba said that he had been invited to the opening ceremony, but not allowed to speak, and that he would not be a part of a photo opportunity with Trump.</p>

<p>The mayor characterized himself "as a child of the movement." He thanked Brown for reading from the Sovereignty Commission files, which also kept documents on his father, Chokwe Lumumba.</p>

<p>"When I was 5 years old, when we first moved back to Mississippi," Lumumba told the crowd, "we received death threats on our phone, and I remember hiding in the closet with my sister with a knife. So, once again, Mr. President, we don't need you to tell us in Mississippi what a civil rights movement is about."</p>

<p>Trump's 'Very Big Words'</p>

<p>It was just about as cold inside the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum as it was on the tarmac. Republican lawmakers, museum donors and a sprinkling of civil-rights veterans sat inside its auditorium awaiting Trump. Myrlie Evers, the widow of Medgar Evers, slid into the room at the last minute before remarks began. Charles Evers and Flaggs arrived just before her. Reuben Anderson, the first black judge on the Mississippi Supreme Court and former NAACP defense counsel, opened the private ceremony, and delivered shortened remarks so as not to keep the president waiting. He took the president on a brief tour of the museum and showed him the photograph of Vernon Dahmer's four sons looking at his burned-out home after their father was murdered by Klansmen who firebombed his home when he and his wife were inside. Vernon was a civil-rights activist.</p>

<p>"That story, as I told the president," Anderson said, "tells a lot about Mississippi. We've been through a whole lot, we've seen a whole lot, but we're a forgiving and loving state."</p>

<p>Anderson thanked Bryant for supporting the museums and for inviting the president. Anderson was the only black person to speak to the overwhelmingly white audience inside of the museum.</p>

<p>In his remarks, Bryant expressed how proud he was that the president as well as Ben Carson, secretary of Housing and Urban Development, had come to the private event. In his White House-appointed position, Carson has referred to poverty as a "state of mind" and called people stolen and sold in the transatlantic slave trade "immigrants."</p>

<p>Bryant then brought out "his friend," the 45th president. Trump entered the room to enormous applause and a standing ovation as "Hail to the Chief" played. He first expressed his love for Mississippi, "a great place," and thanked the governor for the invite. He thanked Anderson, "a great man with a great reputation, even outside of the state of Mississippi," Trump said. Then he shifted back to praising Bryant.</p>

<p>"It was hard work, it was long hours," Trump said. "It's a lot of money, and I know the governor helped with that, and that was a great thing you've done. That's a great legacy, Phil, right there."</p>

<p>The president continued with a quick overview of Mississippi history.</p>

<p>"The Civil Rights Museum records the oppression, cruelty and injustice inflicted on the African American community, the fight to end slavery, to break down Jim Crow, to end segregation, to gain the right to vote, and to achieve the sacred birthright of equality here," the president said, reading from prepared remarks. "And that's big stuff. That's big stuff. Those are very big phrases. Very big words."</p>

<p>Listening were John Perkins, a black preacher who organized store boycotts near Jackson in the 1960s and was arrested and beaten by white officers in a Rankin County jail, and Rev. Ed King, a white man who organized the kneel-in movement with Medgar Evers to desegregate churches in Jackson when he was the Tougaloo College chaplain. The president also explained the legacy of Medgar Evers to the woman who knows it better than anyone.</p>

<p>"We are deeply privileged to be joined today by his incredible widow—somebody that's loved throughout large sections of our country—beyond this area," Trump said. " So I just want to say hello to Myrlie. Myrlie. Where is Myrlie?" He paused to search the crowd for her, while the audience applauded and stood for her.</p>

<p>After his speech, Trump shook people's hands in the front row before being whisked away barely one hour after touching down in Jackson to return to his resort in West Palm Beach, Fla.</p>

<p>Somewhere between Bryant's tweet that Trump "agreed to speak at the opening" and the announcement of Thompson's and Lewis' boycott, the plan shifted to Trump staying out of the public eye, while people waited for the ceremony to start outside.</p>

<p>'Journey of Redemption'</p>

<p>While Trump left out a back entrance, Boy Scouts lined up in front of the two museums, creating a makeshift runway for speakers to walk around the perimeter of the courtyard to get to the stage. Two Trump supporters cheerfully took photos and did interviews with national reporters.</p>

<p>Bryant, House Speaker Philip Gunn, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and private ceremony attendees went outside for the public one. There were plenty of seats to choose from in the audience, and many never filled even once the ceremony got underway.</p>

<p>Former Gov. Haley Barbour, who convinced Bryant to commit to the project, was also absent. Mississippi Department of Archives and History Director Katie Blount said Barbour was stuck in Atlanta due to the snow. Anderson continued as master of ceremonies, introducing predominantly white speakers, including five Republicans.</p>

<p>Bryant, the first speaker, closed his remarks by reading from "Amazing Grace," which he said was "so fitting for these times, written by a former slave trader in 1773, it records a spiritual journey of redemption."</p>

<p>Former Gov. William Winter, a long-time proponent of racial reconciliation and public education, also spoke. He said he had looked forward to that day for a long time and was elated to see all of the schoolchildren in the crowd. In just a few months, Winter said, he will turn 95. "Obviously, I've seen a lot happen in those years. We've gone from some very dark times, but today I must tell you I have never been prouder to be a Mississippian," he said.</p>

<p>Then Myrlie Evers, the only civil-rights veteran to speak during the opening ceremonies, stepped to the microphone.</p>

<p>The regal Evers thanked the people who "walked hand-in-hand" with her through stress, turmoil and her period of hatred for her home state of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Initially, Evers said, hearing that there would be two museums, she worried that Mississippi was going back to its old practices of having "separate but equal" venues. But she said Winter had assured her that the two museums, joined by mere steps, are not complete without one another.</p>

<p>"I thought I knew the state of my birth," Evers said to the crowd. "Going through the museums of my history, I wept, because I felt the blows, I felt the bullets, I felt the tears, I felt the cries."</p>

<p>Evers revealed a sense of weariness, despite her making peace with Mississippi.</p>

<p>"Today we are being challenged almost as most as we were when Medgar Evers was alive," Evers said. She encouraged the audience to visit the museums and learn the history of those who cared enough to put their lives on the line.</p>

<p>"Stand tall, be a Mississippian," Evers said. "Stand tall, be an American. Stand tall, in the belief that we have justice, equality, regardless of race, creed or color."</p>

<p>'Keep Living, Keep Living'</p>

<p>After Evers helped cut the ribbon and walked through the museum doors with Winter and a group of schoolchildren, she, Anderson and others spoke to reporters. Anderson said the effort to get a civil rights museum started for him in 1981 at Tougaloo College. He struggled to go through the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.</p>

<p>"I hate to say this, but I told my grandson this, I can't go through it. It's difficult for me because it's not history. I went through today with the president, and it's unpleasant," he said. "... I am going to get through every bit of it, I've got an exhibit in there myself, but it's not history for me."</p>

<p>Anderson said his perspective on the civil rights museum is different from most Mississippians. "I think these museums are for young people, for my grandson, and what it will show them is separate-but-equal doesn't work. It will show them why Mississippi is 50th in every category. That museum explains Mississippi and where we are today," Anderson said.</p>

<p>Ahead of the bicentennial celebration, many black lawmakers introduced legislation to change the state flag, which contains the Confederate battle cross in its canton. Gunn supported legislative action but did not bring out a bill, saying he did not have the votes. The ceremony was devoid of any banners, save one person who held a Stennis flag throughout the ceremony. There are no flagpoles outside the new museums, which are on the MDAH campus.</p>

<p>"The flag poles are in front of the Old Capitol down the street," she said.</p>

<p>John Dittmer, author of "Local People," dispelled ideas that state funding meant that state leaders sought to intervene with the content. Dittmer said there was never any word from above telling historians and scholars working what to do.</p>

<p>"I don't know of any museum that hits racism so straightforwardly and so hard. When you walk in and see the names of people who were lynched, this is not trying to cover anything up," he said Saturday.</p>

<p>Evers never mentioned Donald Trump by name but said that she sees prejudice, hatred and negativism today she never thought she would see again.</p>

<p>"I'm a little bit weary at this point, but (there is) something about the spirit of justice that raises up like a war horse," Evers told reporters. "That horse that stands with its back sunk in and hears a bell, and I like to say, the bell of freedom, and all of a sudden, the horse is straight and the back becomes stiff and you become determined all over again. And I have to fight for the future of this country, my children."</p>

<p>Evers said she came out of the civil rights museum a changed person.</p>

<p>"I felt the pain all over again. I felt the hope all over again. I felt the determination all over, again, and I came out renewed. ... And if it can happen to me, it can happen to anyone or shall I say almost anyone—and you can take that any way you want," Evers told reporters.</p>

<p>Evers confessed to media that she has fantasized about striking back and getting her hands on a machine gun. "It's not pretty, but it's the truth. ... We can, and we do overcome," she said.</p>

<p>A reporter from Ireland at the opening asked Evers how she learned to forgive.</p>

<p>"It's very difficult—I'm speaking for myself—but I had a great teacher in my husband. We had a discussion one night about some event. ... I never shall forget, I said to him, 'I hate those people.' Medgar gave me one of his looks that could have run chills through your body. And he told me, 'I'm disappointed in you. You should learn to rise above your hatred, and turn it into something positive,'" Evers said.</p>

<p>"My question to him was, 'How dare you say that to me when I see pain and suffering...?' I recall vividly he gave me a look that I would not want to see, and he simply shook his head then walked away, turned around and said something that my grandmother used to say: 'Keep living, keep living, and you will understand. Work for the future. Work for the children.'</p>

<p>"I will never forget that," she said.</p>

<p>CORRECTION: A previous version of the story mistakenly listed Vernon Dahmer as a lawyer. We apologize for the error.</p>

<p>When the 90-year-old man slipped into the open seat next to me, the opening ceremony for Mississippi's duo of history museums was about to start. Mr. Otha Drake is a slight African American man who uses a silver cane and, on Saturday, was wearing a light pink and white shirt, light-colored jeans and a black jacket, topped with a blue knit cap.</p>

<p>As the pretty language of hope and reconciliation filled the air, I would glance at Mr. Drake. He didn't clap, his right hand leaning on his cane, his left holding the program over his face to shield out the sun.</p>

<p>Mr. Drake listened intently as eight men and three women—only three of them black—talked mostly about the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. I, though, winced at the proclamations by white Republicans about the lessons of history, knowing that each one up there actively supports policies that prolong, rather than reverse, the residual effects of racial oppression here.</p>

<p>None is actively trying to change the state flag; all were against fully funding even adequate public education that would especially help re-segregated black districts after whites fled; they support policies that increase income inequality; they oppose ensuring that every Mississippian has access to health care in the state that again ranked 50th in health quality this week. And they all tucked little epistles into their remarks, along with myriad cliched Faulkner references, so their more "state's rights" supporters would know they hadn't left the farm.</p>

<p>By Donna Ladd</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant was especially tough to hear up there going on about grace and civil-rights history. He, after all, annually proclaims Confederate Heritage Month and had invited Donald Trump to desecrate the grounds of what should have been a packed, glorious, diverse opening. Bryant brought up former Gov. Haley Barbour—who helped lead the "southern strategy" of pushing crime fear and other race rhetoric to bait former Dixiecrats to the GOP and, now, to Trump—telling him the civil-rights museum is "something we must do."</p>

<p>Bryant quoted "Amazing Grace," adding, "Mississippi was once lost, now we are found. We were blind and now we see."</p>

<p>Then came the insidious part. "From this day forward, let all our transgressions be left to the past," proclaimed the man who ensures that the state celebrates the Confederacy every April and allows the symbol of maintaining slavery to officially fly.</p>

<p>Seeing Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves—who was invited to speak even though black Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba despicably was not—wasn't much better. Reeves, who yearns to be the next governor, routinely employs rhetorical pages from the racist playbook of the 1960s, blaming the push for a more respectful state flag on "outsiders and media elites," thus ignoring the diverse coalition of native Mississippians trying to change it. In 1964, Klan apologists likewise dismissed three murdered civil-rights workers—two from New York and one from 90 miles from here—as "outside agitators." Reeves just can't be ignorant enough to choose this coded language by accident. If he is, he should spend real time inside the museums learning the history of his state.</p>

<p>Reeves also openly and proudly declares that the school districts that do better, including on test scores—the wealthier and whiter schools, like during segregation—should be rewarded with more resources transferred from struggling (poorer, blacker) schools. That's not just a racist dog whistle; it's a frontal attack on poor, black residents.</p>

<p>Then, U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker name-checked Confederate President Jefferson Davis in the most bizarre wink-and-nod to the old Dixiecrats ever. Wicker included Davis among "heroes": "Like Jefferson Davis who before he would leave Washington, D.C., forever made sure our nation's capitol building was truly magnificent." Before secession, as secretary of war, Davis oversaw the enlargement of the U.S. Capitol.</p>

<p>After the South lost the war over slavery, the U.S. indicted Davis for treason, but didn't bring him to trial. Mississippi gifted a statue of Davis to the Capitol in 1931; it's now in Statuary Hall. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., is among black lawmakers who asked that Confederate statues be removed from the Capitol. He was scheduled to speak at the opening before Wicker but boycotted due to the Trump invitation.</p>

<p>Notably, Davis spoke nearby at the old Mississippi Capitol in 1862 during the Civil War, slamming the northern "miscreants"—a "traditionless and a homeless race," he said. In the building where Mississippi seceded using the words you can hear Morgan Freeman repeat inside the Museum of Mississippi History—"Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery"—Davis warned Mississippians to stay the Confederate course. "Will you be slaves; will you consent to be robbed of your property; to be reduced to provincial dependence; will you renounce the exercise of those rights with which you were born and which were transmitted to you by your fathers?" Davis demanded.</p>

<p>The "property" was slaves, of course.</p>

<p>Davis added about the country that now pays Wicker: "Were it ever to be proposed again to enter into a Union with such a people, I could no more consent to do it than to trust myself in a den of thieves."</p>

<p>Donna Ladd explains how race history in Mississippi is vital to America's future.</p>

<p>In August, Wicker defended Trump's widely panned weak response to the violence by white supremacists and Nazis in Charlottesville, Va., which left a woman dead. The press had been "overly harsh," and the nation "needed to move on," the U.S. senator from Mississippi said then.</p>

<p>When the ceremony ended, Mr. Drake and I chatted. The son of Delta sharecroppers, he spent his childhood near Greenville until his family moved to Jackson in 1942. He attended Lanier High School, then joined the Navy and served in a segregated unit. He had driven to the opening alone; his wife, Mary, stayed home. "I remember it all," he said about the intense and violent segregation of Mississippi. It was a closed society, he said. "It was, it was."</p>

<p>Still, much is different now. "Oh yeah, it already has changed," he said, adding that the museums are a good step forward. I asked what needs to happen to complete the change for black Mississippians.</p>

<p>"Jobs," he said quickly. "Better schooling." I thought of Reeves' rewards for wealthy districts with fewer needs, and felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me.</p>

<p>Hours later, after I toured the Mississippi history museum, I found Mr. Drake sitting on a bench in the museum atrium, leaning forward on his cane, people-watching. "You're still here?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I am," he said, grinning as I walked to the civil rights museum.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I didn't feel quite so tired.</p>

<h2 id="opinionmississippismorerevolutionarymuseum">OPINION: Mississippi’s More Revolutionary Museum</h2>

<p>by: Stuart Rockoff</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-13</p>

<p>url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2017/dec/13/mississippis-more-revolutionary-museum/ </p>

<p>Admittedly, Mississippi Civil Rights Musuem has more of a national draw. I had several friends and family members in other parts of the country text or email me about it, and ask whether I got to see the president. (I did not). But having served on the scholarly review committee for both museums, I can attest that while both are extraordinary institutions, the Museum of Mississippi History is potentially the more revolutionary.

<p>This past weekend, national media descended on Jackson for the opening of the 2 Mississippi Museums, especially after it was announced that President Trump would be taking part in the festivities. There were segments on CNN and MSNBC, features in The New York Times, Washington Post and many other outlets exploring the controversy about his visit to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.</p>

<p>Virtually all of the features focused on the civil-rights museum, which received most of the attention—my joke on Sunday was to ask, "when are they dedicating the other museum?"</p>

<p>Admittedly, that museum has more of a national draw. I had several friends and family members in other parts of the country text or email me about it, and ask whether I got to see the president. (I did not). But having served on the scholarly review committee for both museums, I can attest that while both are extraordinary institutions, the Museum of Mississippi History is potentially the more revolutionary.</p>

<p>After plans for the two museums were announced, I heard from more than one person that the museums would be "separate but equal," one "for us" and one "for them." (The meaning of us and them varied based on the race of who was talking). Certainly, the civil-rights museum presents a bracingly honest account of the violence of white supremacy and the tremendous heroism of the activists who transformed our state against tremendous opposition. You will be hard-pressed to experience the "This Little Light of Mine" installation without getting emotional. But if some Mississippians don't know enough about people like Vernon Dahmer, Fannie Lou Hamer or Medgar Evers (and they will learn more about them in the museum), most understand the movement's basic outlines.</p>

<p>By contrast, our state's history is still enshrouded in mythology. The Museum of Mississippi History shatters these myths. White Mississippians expecting to see "our story" in the Museum of Mississippi History will be taken aback. As they sit in the introductory theater, they will hear narrator Morgan Freeman quote from the 1861 Declaration of Secession, confirming that Mississippi leaders were leaving the U.S. in order to protect slavery; they will learn that slaves made up a majority of the state's population in 1860, and that "redemption" after Reconstruction came about through violence and fraud.</p>

<p>This accurate, inclusive vision of our state's history informs the exhibits throughout the museum. In addition to recreating the home of plantation owners, they also recreate a slave cabin. In the museum's text, "Mississippian" doesn't automatically mean a white person. African Americans do not suddenly appear during the Civil Rights Movement; rather, they are a central part of our state's narrative, from the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to the present day.</p>

<p>History in Mississippi has long been contested terrain. John R. Lynch, the black Republican who served as speaker of the Mississippi House of Representatives during Reconstruction spent much of his later life fighting against the "Lost Cause" narrative of the Civil War and Reconstruction that had taken hold across America. The Confederate monuments that were installed in front of public buildings throughout Mississippi in the early 20th century presented only a narrow perspective on our state's history; other parts of our history, especially those of African Americans like Lynch, were purposefully excluded.</p>

<p>The Museum of Mississippi History gives voice to the full diversity of our state's stories. The museum does not give a slanted account of our past, but rather a full reckoning—both the inspiring and the ugly. Perhaps it's the historian in me, but I've long felt that Mississippi will not truly thrive as a united community until we have a unified story of who we are and where we've been.</p>

<p>For too long Mississippi has had two versions of its history. Despite what many assume, the two museums do not perpetuate this. Rather, their dedication presents a remarkable opportunity to come to terms with our past and chart a better future for all Mississippians. Do not skip the history museum because of what you assume it includes. I promise, it will inspire people to rethink their understanding of our state's past.</p>

<p>The last time Donald Trump was in Jackson, he was campaigning for the presidency. On Saturday, if he attends the opening of the Museum of Mississippi History and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, he will likely encounter protesters. Photo by</p>

<p>Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Mississippi chapter of the NAACP and a Hinds County Democratic committee are calling for Trump's surprise plans to visit Jackson this weekend to be cancelled. That does not seem likely, however, after White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said the president "will participate" in the grand openings of the Museum of Mississippi History and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in her press briefing this afternoon.</p>

<p>Jacksonians were preparing to celebrate the Mississippi's 200th birthday on Saturday, when the two museums will open their doors to the public. Then news broke that President Donald Trump might attend the ceremony. Now, Mississippi protesters plan to greet him there.</p>

<p>Civil-rights veteran Myrlie Evers, the widow of NAACP leader Medgar Evers, whom white supremacist Byron De La Beckwith assassinated at their Jackson home in 1963 in front of his children, is scheduled to speak. U.S. Congressman John Lewis, a civil-rights veteran who helped coordinate the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's "Mississippi Freedom Summer" in 1964, is also scheduled to speak Saturday as well.</p>

<p>Trump lashed out at Lewis in January after the Georgia congressman said he was not a "legitimate" president. Lewis was one of several Democrats who boycotted his inauguration, CNN reported.</p>

<p>But who invited Trump in the first place? He is not listed on the official press release from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History as a speaker or guest, and Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a statement yesterday that Gov. Phil Bryant invited the president.</p>

<p>"With President Donald Trump accepting Gov. Phil Bryant's invitation to attend the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, I am hopeful he will begin to understand the pain he is causing in the black and underserved communities across America," Thompson said in a press release. "His unfair budget cuts in agriculture, education, healthcare, and housing disproportionately impacts people of color and is viewed by many as an act reminiscent of Jim Crow policies of the south."</p>

<p>The governor's communications staff has not responded to repeated calls and emailed requests for comment.</p>

<p>'A Disgraceful President'</p>

<p>The Mississippi chapter of the NAACP is among those who have called on the governor to rescind his invitation to Trump. Corey Wiggins, the executive director of the Mississippi chapter, said members and local branches can choose how they want to participate in Saturday's activities.</p>

<p>"If the president does decide to attend or to visit the museum, I would hope there's a serious dialogue or conversation about the differences in the policies being proposed and how those policies do not align around those core values of the civil rights movement about equality and justice," Wiggins told the Jackson Free Press today.</p>

<p>Jacqueline Amos, the chairwoman of the Mississippi Association of County Democratic Chairs and Hinds County Democratic Party, issued a statement this morning asking authorities to cancel any appearance and remarks the president might make.</p>

<p>"As the direct political heirs to the Freedom Democratic Party and in the spirit of Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, we call upon all the authorities involved to cancel any appearance and remarks by President Donald Trump immediately," Amos said in a press release.</p>

<p>"Any reasonable person knows that the presence of such a hugely divisive and polarizing figure will pervert and diminish what could otherwise be a healing and teaching moment for our state. Mr. Trump attained to the highest office in the land by appeals and tactics that do great and lasting violence to our civil rights heritage," the statement continued.</p>

<p>"His campaign appealed to the very worst demons of the American soul. He is a disgraceful president, a malicious influence, and an abominable human being. He has no place at a celebration of the very values and aspirations his presidency is clearly committed to destroy. Mr. President, leave Mississippi alone. We have had far too much experience with your kind already."</p>

<p>While the mayor is out of town and could not be reached for comment, his chief of staff, Safiya Omari, told the Jackson Free Press Monday that they are still awaiting official details, including an update from Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance. Omari also mentioned the City had heard whisperings of President Trump coming to town last week, which the Jackson Free Press had heard as well.</p>

<p>JPD's spokesman, Sgt. Roderick Holmes, said he has "very limited information," and that he was told to direct inquiries about Saturday's logistics to Megan Powers, a lead press representative at the executive office of the president. Powers told the Jackson Free Press that logistics would be available later this week, and in the meantime to contact the governor's office about confirming other details. The governor's office is not responding.</p>

<p>Some Mississippi lawmakers have sounded off on social media about the news. House Speaker Pro Tempore Greg Snowden, R-Meridian, called on Mississippians to "embrace it."</p>

<p>"Nothing could bring more national attention to the opening of the Museum of Mississippi History and the Civil Rights Museum than an appearance of the President. Embrace it, Mississippians! Democrat, Republican, liberal, conservative ... embrace it!" Snowden tweeted on Monday.</p>

<p>House Minority Whip David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, disagreed.</p>

<p>"Inappropriate for Gov to have invited POTUS to MS for this occasion in light of his statements and actions that can be considered racially insensitive. In fact, I feel that it would be disrespectful to many of those individuals honored in the museum for the president to attend," he tweeted.</p>

<p>Pam Confer, who wrote and produced the song "Mississippi Beautiful" that will play in the "Where Do We Go From Here?" gallery in the Civil Rights Museum, says the opening of the two museums is a historic moment for the state and celebrates people who made large sacrifices.</p>

<p>"While I do acknowledge that it's a tough choice ..., I also acknowledge that it's a moment in history. I stand on Saturday for those people who are no longer here who can't stand, who can't witness this," Confer told the Jackson Free Press today. "So as far as I'm concerned, I stand for them. I stand for the voices and faces who will never know on Saturday."</p>

<p>'Too Much Irony to Process'</p>

<p>Talamieka Brice, who organizes the Pantsuit Nation Mississippi Facebook group, said several community organizers are coming together to form a peaceful protest on Saturday if Trump makes an appearance. She said it is important that the protest be silent because she does not want to disrespect Evers, Lewis or the museum staff.</p>

<p>"Our main goal is to make sure that we are respectful of the occasion as well as expressing our displeasure with the commander-in-chief, who is an open racist," she told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>At this point, Brice said the most likely protest plan is a silent kneel-in, as well as some protesters carrying signs that cannot kneel. She reiterated that the protest is in no way related to the museums.</p>

<p>"We fully support the museums," Brice said. "It's the attendance of Donald Trump (we're protesting)."</p>

<p>Brice said the group is just now making preparations, including securing a permit and finding a place to meet beforehand. One community group, the Jackson metro chapter of Indivisible, is organizing a meet-up at Whole Foods on Wednesday as part of its monthly meeting, but also to prep signs for the presidential visit to the opening of the two museums.</p>

<p>"We extend our full support and well wishes to the Museums and their staff for all the amazing work they are doing," the Facebook event says.</p>

<p>Some Mississippians have decided to boycott Saturday's opening ceremony altogether, opting to visit the museums another day. Blake Case, a local Jacksonian, wrote a piece for "Deep South Voice" explaining why he would not attend on Saturday.</p>

<p>"I, for one, will not be present for Saturday's ceremony if the President decides to attend. Why? Because watching a man that has been praised and endorsed by the KKK, sitting next to the widow and children of Medgar Evers and Congressman John Lewis, open a civil rights museum in Mississippi is too much irony to process, even for me," he wrote in the piece published Monday.</p>

<p>This story is developing and has been updated with confirmation from Sarah Sanders that Trump plans to participate in the opening of the two museums on Saturday.  Read more about Mississippi's race history at jfp.ms/slavery.</p>

<h2 id="kneelinmovementstriedtodesegregatejacksonchurchesin1960s">Kneel-In Movements Tried to De-segregate Jackson Churches in 1960s</h2>

<p>by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>The Mississippi Humanities Council sponsored a three-day, four-part series to discuss the history of the kneel-in movement to desegregate Jackson churches in the 1960s. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — This day and age, it is almost impossible to talk about kneeling without thinking about Colin Kaepernick and his NFL protests during which he and now other football players have taken a knee during the national anthem to bring awareness to racial injustices in America. But in the early 1960s, the kneel-in movement centered around integrating churches in the South. In Jackson, this manifested as a student-focused movement that led by Rev. Ed King even after NAACP leader Medgar Evers was assassinated. King was then the Tougaloo Chaplain who helped students organize for civil rights and was close to Evers.</p>

<p>In 1963 and 1964 under the leadership of King, who is white, integrated groups of volunteers attempted to attend Sunday worship services at 22 all-white Protestant and Catholic churches in downtown Jackson. The movement began in historic Woodworth church on the campus of Tougaloo College.</p>

<p>"On May 29 police arrested King and others for trespassing when they attempted a kneel-in on the steps of the Federal Building on Capitol Street. The next day, King's actions convinced his fellow Methodist ministers to discontinue his status with the conference, effectively expelling him from his own church," The Mississippi Encyclopedia reads.</p>

<p>King and Medgar Evers decided to visit white churches as a way to skirt around a court injunction that banned public demonstrations and civil disobedience. The Jackson kneel-ins began around May 1963, and Evers was assassinated on June 12, 1963. King continued the movement out of a "solemn obligation" to show Evers could not be stopped. The intention was to "stir the consciences of white Christians" through a campaign that would invite churchgoers to rethink the morality of segregated churches.</p>

<p>"Hopefully, people if they turned away, shut the doors, they would have to think about what they had done," King told the Jackson Free Press. "But there was one church where after the ushers said, 'no, you can't come in,' we said, 'well, would you let Jesus in?', and one man said, 'this is our church, what does He have to do with it?'"</p>

<p>Most churches refused to allow volunteers to enter, but the Mississippi Encyclopedia says that "after police began arresting visitors in 1963, some denominations began to reevaluate their racial policies."</p>

<p>Between Saturday, Dec. 2, through Monday, Dec. 4, the Mississippi Humanities Council sponsored a four-part event series focused on bringing the Jackson community together to engage with what the church kneel-in movement meant in the 1960s and what we can learn from it today.</p>

<p>At its second event in the chamber room of the Old Capitol Museum, Mississippians gathered for a panel discussion positioning kneel-ins and civil rights movements in the present and future. Rev. King sat in the audience for a panel discussion between moderator Augustus Argrett; author and professor Ralph Eubanks; Von Gordon of the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation; Central United Methodist Church Pastor Rev. David McCoy; civil-rights veteran and minister Dr. John Perkins, and Perry Perkins of Working Together Jackson.</p>

<p>Martin Luther King Jr. said once that Sunday church is "the most segregated hour." An audience member asked for advice for desegregating churches today and how they can become more diverse so the next generation will worship together and become advocates side-by-side through religion.</p>

<p>"Building relationships," McCoy said. "You and I have to talk, and you have to come to my church, and then I have to do the same. We have to go out and eat together, form ball teams, whatever we can do to interact to bring about conversation. For us to dispel that myth of superiority in one of us and inferiority in the other, it comes from all of us sitting here to make that a reality."</p>
