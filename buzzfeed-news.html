<h2 id="afederaljudgejustorderedanendtomostmigrantfamilyseparations">A Federal Judge Just Ordered An End To Most Migrant Family Separations</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/a-federal-judge-just-ordered-an-end-to-most-family </p>

<p>Brendan Mcdermid / Reuters </p>

<p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to end separations for most migrant families at the border and to reunify parents and children who were already separated within the next month, with limited exceptions.</p>

<p>In a ruling late Tuesday, US District Judge Dana Sabraw wrote that the federal government had adopted a practice of separating families without "any effective system or procedure" for tracking children, for allowing parents and children to communicate while they were apart, or for reuniting families once a parent's criminal case was over. He called it a "startling reality."</p>

<p>"The facts set forth before the Court portray reactive governance — responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the Government’s own making," Sabraw wrote. "They belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our Constitution."</p>

<p>Sabraw authorized the case, brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in federal court in San Diego, to proceed as a class action. The lawsuit now covers all adults in immigration custody who have a child they have been separated from and whose child has been placed into government custody. This includes both parents who entered the US at an official port of entry as well as those who did not.</p>

<p>Under Sabraw's order, the federal government is now blocked from separating families while a parent is in immigration detention, absent evidence that a parent is unfit or poses a danger to the child, or that the parent has waived being held together. He also ordered the government to reunite all class members with their children within 30 days, or 14 days if a child was younger than 5 years old, and to allow parents to contact separated children within 10 days.</p>

<p>"This ruling is an enormous victory for parents and children who thought they may never see each other again. Tears will be flowing in detention centers across the country when the families learn they will be reunited," Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement.</p>

<p>A Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement that Sabraw's decision "makes it even more imperative that Congress finally act to give federal law enforcement the ability to simultaneously enforce the law and keep families together." There was no immediate comment on whether the government would appeal the decision.</p>

<p>In concluding that the plaintiffs would suffer irreparable harm without action from the court, Sabraw quoted statements filed by parents describing their experiences of separation from their children. The record, Sabraw wrote, showed that "the separations at issue have been agonizing for the parents who have endured them."</p>

<p>The two lead plaintiffs in the case are referred to only as "Ms. L." and "Ms. C." According to the lawsuit, Ms. L. is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, who entered the United States with her then–6-year-old daughter in November 2017 through a port of entry at the US–Mexico border in California. Ms. L. sought asylum on religious persecution grounds. After several days of being detained together, she and her daughter were separated for several months until Ms. L. was released pending a decision on her asylum application. Federal officials returned Ms. L.'s daughter to her after confirming their relationship via a DNA test.</p>

<p>Ms. C. is a Brazilian citizen and entered the United States "between ports of entry" with her son, who was 14 years old at the time, according to court papers. They were separated while she was charged and convicted of entering the country illegally, and were not reunited until after Ms. C. had served her sentence and been released on bond from immigration detention.</p>

<p>Though Sabraw's order is not limited to parents seeking asylum, he had harsh words for the government about allegations that families had been separated after presenting at a US port of entry with an asylum claim.</p>

<p>"We are a country of laws, and of compassion. We have plainly stated our intent to treat refugees with an ordered process, and benevolence, by codifying principles of asylum," the judge wrote. "The Government’s treatment of Ms. L. and other similarly situated class members does not meet this standard, and it is unlikely to pass constitutional muster."</p>

<p>The order came a week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that addressed the separation of families at the border. The executive order stated that the administration's preference was to house families together, and ordered the US Department of Defense and other federal agencies to find additional detention space for the US Department of Homeland Security to do so.</p>

<p>The order also directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to have the Justice Department ask a judge to amend a 1997 settlement agreement that restricts how long children can stay in immigration detention. Government lawyers filed those papers on June 21.</p>

<p>The ACLU's lawsuit does not challenge the separation of families when a parent is in jail for a criminal offense, including illegal entry into the United States. Rather, the ACLU is challenging the separation of families when parents and children are both being held in immigration detention facilities — which can happen while a parent is facing criminal prosecution — and federal officials have not shown that a parent is unfit to be with their child or would put the child in danger.</p>

<p>US Customs and Border Protection announced this week that it had temporarily stopped referring illegal entry cases involving migrants parents who arrived with a child to the Justice Department for criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>The ACLU argued for a nationwide injunction prohibiting the federal government from separating families in immigration detention without a clear finding of parental unfitness or danger. There are hundreds of detained individuals who would be covered by the lawsuit, according to the ACLU's filings.</p>

<p>"The government has offered no legitimate basis for taking Plaintiffs’ children away. The government provided no evidence that Ms. L. or Ms. C. abused or neglected their children, or that they are unfit parents, to justify their separation from their children for four and five months, respectively. And for other class members, by definition, the government has not demonstrated abuse, neglect, or other unfitness in any kind of hearing," the ACLU argued in its March motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>

<p>Tuesday's orders followed a hearing on June 22 in which the government's lawyer had few concrete answers for a wide range of questions. Sabraw had agreed to delay a decision on the injunction request, to give both sides a few more days to submit additional information about how Trump's executive order applied to the case.</p>

<p>The Justice Department argued that as the court weighed whether to enter an injunction, the balance should tip in favor of "the government’s and public’s interests to protect the safety and welfare of children from exploitation by smugglers and human traffickers."</p>

<p>But Sabraw rejected the argument that Trump's order and the Homeland Security guidance that followed made a court order unnecessary. Trump's order included "various qualifications" to reunification that still gave the government discretion to separate families, the judge wrote, and the DHS guidance didn't address the process for reunifying families after a parent's criminal case was over but before they were deported.</p>

<p>"Placing the burden on the parents to find and request reunification with their children under the circumstances presented here is backwards," Sabraw wrote. "When children are separated from their parents under these circumstances, the Government has an affirmative obligation to track and promptly reunify these family members."</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Sabraw had denied the Justice Department's motion to dismiss the case. He found that the court had jurisdiction to consider the plaintiffs' constitutional challenge to family separation, which he wrote was separate from a challenge to the government's decision about whether to detain people in the first place.</p>

<p>Sabraw concluded that the constitutional right to "family integrity" would cover the types of situations alleged in the lawsuit, in which a parent and child who arrived together were separated while they were detained pending the outcome of immigration proceedings. The judge found that the allegations also met the "shocks the conscience" standard that courts apply in weighing certain due process claims.</p>

<p>"Such conduct, if true, as it is assumed to be on the present motion, is brutal, offensive, and fails to comport with traditional notions of fair play and decency. At a minimum, the facts alleged are sufficient to show the government conduct at issue 'shocks the conscience' and violates Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to family integrity," Sabraw wrote.</p>

<h2 id="justiceanthonykennedyisretiringfromthesupremecourt">Justice Anthony Kennedy Is Retiring From The Supreme Court</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/justice-anthony-kennedy-retires </p>

<p>Joshua Roberts / Reuters </p>

<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy announced on Wednesday that he would be stepping down from the bench after more than 30 years on the high court — a move that could alter the face of the court and the future of its decisions.</p>

<p>In a letter to President Donald Trump, Kennedy said his retirement will be effective July 31, adding that it is "the highest of honors to serve on this Court."</p>

<p>Kennedy’s decision to step down after years of providing the critical fifth vote to forge a majority opinion in pivotal cases — the "swing-vote justice," he was often called — means that Trump will get a second chance to name a nominee to the Supreme Court, a legacy-shaping opportunity that could affect the country for decades.</p>

<p>Although the court generally respects its prior precedents — referred to as stare decisis — it need not do so. A reconstituted court with Kennedy's replacement on the bench would have the capability to revisit some of the key 5-4 decisions — from marriage equality to abortion — issued during Kennedy's tenure.</p>

<p>Those questions, no doubt, will be front and center in Senate confirmation hearings over his successor.</p>

<p>For his part, Trump on Friday said that he met with Kennedy on Wednesday at the White House for about half an hour. Trump said the task of picking his nominee will "begin immediately" and will "come from the list of 25 people" that he previously had issued. "Hopefully we will pick someone who is just as outstanding."</p>

<p>Later at a rally in North Dakota, Trump told supporters he was also honored by Kennedy's timing.</p>

<p>"I’m very honored that he chose to do it during my term in office because he felt confident in me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy," he said.</p>

<p>Shortly after the news became public, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke from the Senate floor, thanking Kennedy for his service and for his "ardent defense of the First Amendment and the First Amendment’s right to political speech" — a reference to the 2010 Citizens United decision decried on the left for its role in increasing the role of corporate money in elections.</p>

<p>"The Senate stands ready to fulfill its constitutional role ... to fill this vacancy," he said. "We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy's successor this fall."</p>

<p>Kennedy, who joined the Supreme Court in February 1988, already had been serving as a federal appellate judge on the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit for almost 13 years before taking his seat on the high court.</p>

<p>After more than 43 years as a judge, the California-raised jurist announced his decision at the end of a complex term at the Supreme Court — and a year and a half into the Trump administration.</p>

<p>While voting to uphold the travel ban this week, Kennedy nonetheless wrote separately in what turned out to be a final note of sorts about his view of what America is and — in the most Kennedy of ways — what it should be.</p>

<p>"The First Amendment prohibits the establishment of religion and promises the free exercise of religion. From these safeguards, and from the guarantee of freedom of speech, it follows there is freedom of belief and expression," he wrote. "It is an urgent necessity that officials adhere to these constitutional guarantees and mandates in all their actions, even in the sphere of foreign affairs. An anxious world must know that our Government remains committed always to the liberties the Constitution seeks to preserve and protect, so that freedom extends outward, and lasts."</p>

<p>Kennedy's decision to step down comes just a little more than a year after Trump’s first nominee to the court, Justice Neil Gorsuch, took his seat on the bench — the result of Senate Republicans’ decision not to consider former President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016. After Trump’s unexpected win, he nominated Gorsuch from a list of mostly federal and state appellate judges who are backed by the Federalist Society.</p>

<p>Now, with only a bare majority required in the Senate to replace Kennedy, Trump will put forth a second high court nominee. He has said in the past that he would again return to the list, which he has since expanded to include others, for another nominee, should a vacancy occur.</p>

<p>Kennedy's legacy on the court had appeared to have been set three years ago, when the court issued its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, the case that brought marriage equality to the US.</p>

<p>Echoing and expanding on his rulings over the past 20 years in three other rulings expanding the rights of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, Kennedy declared, "Under the Constitution, same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex couples, and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right."</p>

<p>Of the same-sex couples challenging marriage bans — but in language that sums up his gay rights legacy — Kennedy went on to write, "They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right."</p>

<p>Kennedy also had joined with the court’s more liberal members and, while she was on the court, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in upholding the constitutional right to an abortion — most notably in a key 1992 decision in which he, O’Connor, and retired Justice David Souter coauthored an opinion declaring that "the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed."</p>

<p>On many matters, though, Kennedy was a reliable vote for a conservative majority on the court.</p>

<p>Most notably, it was Kennedy who authored the court's opinion in Citizens United — the decision praised by McConnell on Wednesday. Kennedy regularly sided with the conservative bloc in favor of corporate interests, writing the court’s majority opinion this term, for example, that foreign corporations could not be sued in US courts under the Alien Tort Statute for connections to terrorist acts committed abroad.</p>

<p>Kennedy also provided the critical fifth vote for the court's conservative majority in siding with George W. Bush in the December 2000 case that ended that year’s presidential election and brought Bush to the White House.</p>

<p>The 2000 election was the fourth presidential election that took place with Kennedy on the high court, and he would stay on the court through four more.</p>

<p>President Ronald Reagan nominated Kennedy to the Supreme Court in November 1987, his third choice to fill the seat of then-retiring Justice Lewis Powell. Reagan's first choice, Robert Bork, was rejected by the Senate. His second choice, Douglas Ginsburg, withdrew his name from nomination after he acknowledged having smoked marijuana.</p>

<p>The Senate quickly approved Kennedy's nomination, however, without a single senator objecting on the final vote on Feb. 3, 1988: 97–0.</p>

<p>Thirty years later, another significant part of Kennedy’s legacy might be that he is leaving the court with several open questions on issues that have long captured his interest — questions that his successor could help resolve for the next generation.</p>

<p>After taking up two cases this term raising questions about whether courts can resolve partisan gerrymandering claims, and, if so, how, the court punted on both equal protection and First Amendment questions raised — and Kennedy, who has long expressed interest in partisan gerrymandering issues, wrote nothing in either case.</p>

<p>In another case — linked with Kennedy’s legacy on gay rights — the court again punted, this time on the issue of whether religious opposition to same-sex couples’ marriages should exempt people and businesses from following public accommodation nondiscrimination laws generally applicable to all. This was the Masterpiece Cakeshop case, and although Kennedy wrote the court’s opinion in the case, the court did not resolve that key question — with Kennedy and the court instead focusing the decision on “hostility” to religion that was shown to the baker by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission.</p>

<p>A third area in which Kennedy left his ultimate view unresolved is the death penalty. Although he regularly sided with conservatives on challenges brought as to the method of execution a state chose to use, he joined with the court's more liberal members in key decisions restricting who is eligible for the death penalty and expressed great concern with executions. At the same time, he never decided to join some of his more liberal colleagues in publicly questioning whether the constitutionality of the death penalty itself should be reconsidered.</p>

<h2 id="thesupremecourtupholdstrumpstravelban">The Supreme Court Upholds Trump's Travel Ban</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-26</p>

<p>Protests outside the Supreme Court following the travel ban decision June 26.</p>

<p>Chris Geidner/BuzzFeed</p>

<p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld President Donald Trump's travel ban.</p>

<p>"We express no view on the soundness of the policy," Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court's 5–4 conservative majority — while upholding Trump's third attempt at barring entry to those people from countries deemed by the administration to have insufficient vetting procedures to ensure that national security concerns are addressed.</p>

<p>In the decision, Roberts wrote that Trump had authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act to issue the September 2017 proclamation to "suspend entry of aliens into the United States." The court went on to hold that challengers to the ban also were unlikely to succeed in their claim that the proclamation violates the Establishment Clause.</p>

<p>The decision is a victory for the Trump administration, but it only came after multiple court rulings on the two prior iterations of the travel ban significantly altered — or, "watered down," as Trump himself said — the policy. The ruling Tuesday was only on the third version of the ban, a more narrow proclamation that followed a process of review involving the Homeland Security, State, and Justice departments. The administration withdrew the earlier versions of the ban before the Supreme Court was able to hear the merits of the administration’s arguments on those orders.</p>

<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor harshly criticized the decision — spending more than 15 minutes reading from her dissent on the bench Tuesday. In doing so, she compared the decision to the 1944 Supreme Court decision in Korematsu v. US upholding the internment camps used to detain people of Japanese ancestry during World War II.</p>

<p>The court, however, used the travel ban case to refute — and overturn — that earlier case.</p>

<p>"Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and — to be clear — 'has no place in law under the Constitution,'" Roberts wrote, quoting from Justice Robert Jackson's dissent to the 1944 decision.</p>

<p>For Sotomayor, that was only half of the issue.</p>

<p>"This formal repudiation of a shameful precedent is laudable and long overdue. But it does not make the majority’s decision here acceptable or right," she wrote, concluding that "the Court redeploys the same dangerous logic underlying Korematsu and merely replaces one 'gravely wrong' decision with another."</p>

<p>She was joined in her dissent by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. (Justice Stephen Breyer wrote his own dissent, joined by Justice Elena Kagan.)</p>

<p>Kevin Lamarque / Reuters</p>

<p>Roberts, in the court's opinion, disclaimed the Korematsu comparison, writing that "it is wholly inapt to liken that morally repugnant order to a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission."</p>

<p>In addressing the challenge under the INA — an argument that Trump had gone too far under the law — Roberts wrote that the challengers' "request for a searching inquiry into the persuasiveness of the President’s justifications is inconsistent with the broad statutory text and the deference traditionally accorded the President in this sphere."</p>

<p>The law gives the president the ability to bar entry of a "class of aliens," and Roberts wrote that phrasing "comfortably encompasses a group of people linked by nationality."</p>

<p>The court also tossed aside an argument from the challengers that a nondiscrimination provision in the INA limits the president's actions. The provisions, Roberts wrote, "operate in different spheres" — the president's ability to bar entry relates to admissibility, whereas the nondiscrimination provision simply relates to the issuance of visas.</p>

<p>"Had Congress instead intended in [the nondiscrimination provision] to constrain the President’s power to determine who may enter the country, it could easily have chosen language directed to that end," Roberts wrote, ultimately concluding, "The Proclamation is squarely within the scope of Presidential authority under the INA."</p>

<p>Regarding the Establishment Clause challenge — the argument that the ban was motivated by anti-Muslim animus — the court detailed some of the statements and tweets from Trump and his advisers that challengers pointed to as reasons for finding an anti-Muslim bias behind the ban.</p>

<p>Roberts wrote that the issue before the court "is not whether to denounce the statement," but instead, "the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility" — specifically "a national security directive regulating the entry of aliens abroad."</p>

<p>To that, he said, the court "must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself."</p>

<p>The court "assume[d]" that it could look beyond the text of the policy to determine "whether the entry policy is plausibly related to the Government’s stated objective to protect the country and improve vetting processes."</p>

<p>The court found "persuasive evidence that the entry suspension has a legitimate grounding in national security concerns, quite apart from any religious hostility," Roberts wrote, concluding that "the Government has set forth a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis review."</p>

<p>Trump was unsurprisingly happy about the decision, reacting with a "Wow!" to the news on Twitter.</p>

<p>SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!</p>

<p>In dissenting, both Breyer and Sotomayor noted that another case from the term was worth looking at for its application to the travel ban case regarding the Establishment Clause claim.</p>

<p>Breyer wrote that if the proclamation "was significantly affected by religious animus against Muslims, it would violate the relevant statute or the First Amendment itself" — citing the Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission decision, in which the court held that commission had shown impermissible "hostility" to the baker's religion, as an example of when the court had made that point clear.</p>

<p>Sotomayor, citing Trump's anti-Muslim campaign statements, wrote that, in office, "he has continued to make remarks that a reasonable observer would view as an unrelenting attack on the Muslim religion and its followers."</p>

<p>She then pointed to the Masterpiece decision, writing that "the Court recently found less pervasive official expressions of hostility and the failure to disavow them to be constitutionally significant. ... It should find the same here."</p>

<p>The majority opinion did not address the Masterpiece discussion directly, although its discussion that the case involved "the authority of the Presidency itself" — as opposed to a state civil rights commission — served as an implied distinction.</p>

<p>For their parts, both Justices Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined the majority opinion but wrote separately to highlight a particular issue that the case raised for them.</p>

<p>Kennedy — in a brief, two-page concurrence — noted that "in some instances, governmental action may be subject to judicial review to determine whether or not it is inexplicable by anything but animus." He added, though, that even when "the statements and actions of Government officials are not subject to judicial scrutiny or intervention[,] ... [t]hat does not mean those officials are free to disregard the Constitution and the rights it proclaims and protects."</p>

<p>As to the presidency, he added, pointedly, "An anxious world must know that our Government remains committed always to the liberties the Constitution seeks to preserve and protect, so that freedom extends outward, and lasts."</p>

<p>For his part, Thomas wrote on a topic of conservative note over the past year: nationwide injunctions.</p>

<p>"I am skeptical that district courts have the authority to enter universal injunctions," he wrote, stating that they "did not emerge until a century and a half after the founding" and, in his view, "appear to be inconsistent with longstanding limits on equitable relief and the power of Article III courts."</p>

<p>The history of the travel ban began in December 2015, when Trump, as a candidate, called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on." At points throughout the campaign, he changed his language — but he continued to press for some version of his promise.</p>

<p>At the end of his first week in office, Trump signed the travel ban executive order — barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and halting the entire refugee program for a period of time. The executive order — implemented immediately and without notice — led to chaos and protests at airports across the country and court orders halting enforcement of parts and eventually most of the ban.</p>

<p>In March 2017, Trump issued a second order — which he later referred to as a "watered down, politically correct version" of his initial ban. It too faced opposition from the courts, although the Supreme Court allowed it to go into effect in part.</p>

<p>Finally, in September, Trump issued a third, narrower ban — one based, the administration argues, on a full review by federal agencies. After challenges, the Supreme Court allowed this version to go into effect while appeals were heard.</p>

<p>At arguments in April, the court appeared to be of two minds on the debate, with the justices' questions showing clear concerns about weighing into presidential decisions related to national security, but also a willingness to probe at when the possibility of a discriminatory motive for presidential actions would justify barring those decisions from taking effect.</p>

<p>Protesters in San Diego on June 23.</p>

<p>A previously unreported 100 minors who were separated from their families when they crossed the US southern border since the Trump administration's "zero tolerance" policy went into effect in early April are now with “sponsors,” an administration official told BuzzFeed News on Monday.</p>

<p>The 100 children are in addition to the more than 2,300 who were separated, the 522 who have been reunited, and the 16 who were scheduled to be reunited but were delayed because of inclement weather.</p>

<p>It is unclear who, exactly, the sponsors of the 100 separated minors are, but they could include family members, friends, or parents already living in the US or a family member who is being deported along with the child.</p>

<p>The Trump administration, in a vague email Saturday night, said that there are plans in place to reunite separated children with family, plans that include a hotline, “Juvenile Coordinators who manage these cases,” and an “identification mechanism.”</p>

<h2 id="federaljudgerulesagainstsuspendingpoorpeoplesdriverslicensesforunpaidcourtfines">Federal Judge Rules Against Suspending Poor People's Driver's Licenses for Unpaid Court Fines</h2>

<p id="byline">by: C.J. Ciaramella</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-07-03</p>

<p id="link">url: https://reason.com/blog/2018/07/03/federal-judge-rules-suspending-poor-peop </p>

<p>Jim Weber/ZUMA Press/Newscom</p>

<p>A federal judge has blocked Tennessee's practice of suspending driver's licenses for unpaid court fees without first determining if the debtors are too poor to pay. The policy, U.S. District Judge Aleta Trauger ruled yesterday, violates poor residents' due process and equal protection rights under the 14th Amendment.</p>

<p>"[A]s applied to indigent drivers, the law is not merely ineffective; it is powerfully counterproductive," Trauger wrote. "If a person has no resources to pay a debt, he cannot be threatened or cajoled into paying it; he may, however, become able to pay it in the future. But taking his driver's license away sabotages that prospect."</p>

<p>Trauger ordered the state to cease suspending licenses for unpaid court debts and to give all residents who had their licenses suspended for such reasons an opportunity to have them reinstated.</p>

<p>License suspensions for unpaid court fines, drug violations, and other non-moving violations came into the spotlight in 2014 following the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Investigative reporting revealed the town's rapacious use of fines and fees to generate revenue, sparking a nationwide look at how cities use petty fines and fees.</p>

<p>Many states across the U.S. passed license suspension laws to go after scofflaws, but civil liberties groups say they often trap poor residents in a debt spiral by depriving them of the means to make money in the first place.</p>

<p>The two lead plaintiffs of the case, James Thomas and David Hixson, were physically disabled and living in a homeless shelter, respectively. Both had their licenses suspended for unpaid court fines.</p>

<p>States across the country have suspended more than 7 million licenses, according to The Washington Post. Virginia alone suspends 900,000 licenses—11 percent of its total population—at any given time for unpaid fines and fees.</p>

<p>Tennessee suspended 146,211 licenses for unpaid court fines and fees between 2012 and 2016, according to the lawsuit. That doesn't include suspensions for unpaid traffic fines.</p>

<p>Trauger's decision was not a surprise. The judge lambasted the state's policy in earlier decisions in a parallel case challenging suspensions for unpaid traffic fines—one commanding Tennessee to immediately reinstate the licenses of two lead plaintiffs, and the other allowing the lawsuit to proceed as a class action.</p>

<p>In both, Trauger wrote that the practical effects of Tennessee's license suspension policies appeared to be at complete odds with the rules' stated purpose—that is, collecting debt.</p>

<p>"Taking an individual's driver's license away to try to make her more likely to pay a fine is not using a shotgun to do the job of a rifle: it is using a shotgun to treat a broken arm," the judge wrote last year.</p>

<p>Trauger noted that Tennessee towns and cities are "pervasively structured" around motor vehicles, and that one didn't need "reams of expert testimony to understand that an individual who cannot drive is at an extraordinary disadvantage in both earning and maintaining material resources."</p>

<p>In January, another federal judge in Michigan enjoined the practice when it is applied to the very poor, ruling that suspending licenses without determining the debtors' ability to pay likely violates due process.</p>

<p>A lawsuit challenging Virginia's policy was dismissed on technical grounds last year but still spurred the state to reform its practices. Nevertheless, Virginia still suspended nearly 1 million licenses last year.</p>

<p>The Tennessee lawsuit was brought by Civil Rights Corps, a group challenging bail policies and license suspensions in several states, as well as by the National Center for Law and Economic Justice, Just City, and the law firm Baker, Donelson, Bearman, Caldwell and Berkowitz.</p>

<p>"This is an incredible victory for low-income Tennesseans whose contact with the criminal system leaves them saddled with court debt and unable to get around in a state that lacks adequate public transportation ," Civil Rights Corps founder Alec Karakatsanis said following the ruling. "Today, one immense barrier to escaping the cycle of poverty and criminalization has been removed —people will be able to go to work, see their families and friends, get to the grocery store and doctor's office, and do all of the things that we all take for granted and that give life meaning.

<h2 id="thesupremecourtrulesthatpolicegenerallyneedawarranttogetcellsiterecords">The Supreme Court Rules That Police Generally Need A Warrant To Get Cell-Site Records</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-22</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/supreme-court-warrant-fourth-amendment </p>

<p>Chris Geidner / BuzzFeed News</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled on Friday that a warrant is generally required for police to obtain historical records of a person's cell-site records.</p>

<p>The decision providing protections for the data collected each time a person's cellphone connects to a cellphone tower — data that Chief Justice John Roberts wrote provides "a comprehensive chronicle of the user’s past movements" — is a victory for privacy advocates.</p>

<p>Roberts wrote the court's 5–4 decision, holding that the acquisition of such records is a Fourth Amendment search and that police generally must show probable cause to obtain such records.</p>

<p>"[T]his case is not about 'using a phone' or a person’s movement at a particular time," he wrote. "It is about a detailed chronicle of a person’s physical presence compiled every day, every moment, over several years."</p>

<p>Roberts was joined in his decision by the court's four more liberal justices. His four more conservative colleagues dissented — each writing their own opinion as to why, in their view, the court's decision was incorrect.</p>

<p>In the case before the court, police had obtained 127 days of cell-site records for Timothy Carpenter, who was suspected of being part of a series of robberies in Michigan and Ohio. Those records, Roberts noted, provided "12,898 location points cataloging Carpenter's movements — an average of 101 data points every day." They also provided a basis for his conviction — being used at trial and cited in the prosecution's closing arguments.</p>

<p>Police could not have obtained such information in the past without much difficulty, Roberts noted, holding that the records represent a new type of "tireless and absolute surveillance." People have a reasonable expectation of privacy — the touchstone for Fourth Amendment protections — in those records, the court held, because they detail "the whole of [their] physical movements."</p>

<p>The government argued that the records could be obtained without a warrant under the "third-party doctrine" — in which the court has held that, for example, bank records and information about what numbers a person calls, records regularly maintained by companies, can be collected without a warrant because they are freely provided to businesses.</p>

<p>Although the government maintained that the case presented a "straightforward application" of that rule, Roberts wrote for the court that applying that doctrine to cell-site records would be "a significant extension of it to a distinct category of information."</p>

<p>Instead, the court's majority focused more on a pair of cases in which the court has found that evolving technology has changed the analysis of the issue. "When confronting new concerns wrought by digital technology," Roberts wrote, "this Court has been careful not to uncritically extend existing precedents."</p>

<p>Justice Anthony Kennedy, dissenting from the court's decision, was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. He echoed the government's position, writing, "Adherence to this Court’s longstanding precedents and analytic framework would have been the proper and prudent way to resolve this case."</p>

<h2 id="afterawhitecopshotablackmanhesuedthecityforracialdiscrimination">After A White Cop Shot A Black Man, He Sued The City For Racial Discrimination</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Albert Samaha</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertsamaha/ricky-ball-canyon-boykin-police-shooting-racial </p>

<p>The fatal police shooting of Ricky Ball in October 2015 convulsed the city of Columbus, Mississippi. Residents marched. Some businesses, fearing a race riot because a white cop had killed a black man, closed on protest day. A city council member accused the department of planting a gun beside Ball’s body. The police chief resigned. The district attorney called in state authorities to handle the case.</p>

<p>Finally, in September 2016, a grand jury indicted the officer, Canyon Boykin, on manslaughter charges. Boykin’s case still hasn’t gone to trial, but if the recent past is anything to go by, he’s likely to make it through without punishment — and even walk away from the case ahead, handed money for his troubles. That’s because shortly after he shot 25-year-old Ball as Ball ran away following a traffic stop, Boykin sued the city for racial discrimination, claiming he’d been unfairly fired for being a white cop who’d killed a black person. Just before his discrimination lawsuit was to go to trial last year, the city settled with Boykin for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p>“That’s what really made me realize how much is stacked against us,” said Ricky’s cousin, Ernesto Ball, who is 46. “That’s the moment I began to think that maybe these cops can really get away with whatever.”</p>

<p>The Commercial Dispatch / Luisa Porter</p>

<p>Former Columbus Police Department officer Canyon Boykin is led from the Lowndes County Court in handcuffs while onlookers applaud.</p>

<p>The Commercial Dispatch / Luisa Porter</p>

<p>Over the past decade, at least 25 white officers have sued their cities for racial discrimination, according to a BuzzFeed News review of media reports. Eleven had their cases rejected by a judge or jury. Nine, though, won jury verdicts at trial or reached monetary settlements, all after claims the officers had been passed up for promotions because of their skin color or fired for saying something interpreted as racist. The other cases are pending. None of those police lawsuit victories or settlements involved a fatal shooting — until Boykin’s case, which occurred as cops across the country seemed to be facing a reckoning over their use of force. In the months before and after Boykin's indictment, officers involved in seven high-profile shootings — in Albuquerque, New Mexico; North Charleston, South Carolina; Cincinnati; St. Louis; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Milwaukee; and Falcon Heights, Minnesota — were criminally charged. Boykin, 28, claimed he’d been swept up by this wave of outrage and was a victim of “uninformed public pressure.” He would not have been fired, his lawsuit stated, “except that he is white and the deceased was black.”</p>

<p>“I don’t have any faith in the justice system anymore.”</p>

<p>Since Boykin’s indictment, the officers in those seven high-profile police shooting cases have all gone to trial, and not one was convicted in state court. The outcomes revealed a reality that is becoming increasingly clear: Investigators, prosecutors, judges, and juries can try to hold officers accountable, but none of that matters when laws continue to protect any cop who says they feared for their life before pulling the trigger.</p>

<p>“I don’t have any faith in the justice system anymore,” Ernesto said. “At first I was excited. At first I thought that maybe it would be something quick. But as time goes on, and things start happening… It’s hard, man. It’s hard to keep that belief I been trying to keep.”</p>

<p>Ricky had encountered Boykin at least once before. He’d befriended a relative of Boykin’s, and one day in August 2015, he drove with her through the neighborhood. Boykin, who’d been on the force for three years, and his partner, Max Branch, followed the blue Hyundai, calling into dispatch that they were about to pull it over.</p>

<p>“Be a black driving, white female passenger,” Boykin said into the radio, according to a transcript of Branch’s body camera. Boykin’s camera was not on, which is a violation of department policy.</p>

<p>“Who’s driving?” Branch asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Boykin replied. “I can’t remember his fucking name. I seen him one time over by Ash Street.”</p>

<p>The cops flashed their lights, the car didn’t stop, the cops gave chase — losing it down a side street before eventually catching up. They found the car stopped.</p>

<p>“God, please still be in the car motherfucker,” Boykin said. “Please still be in the fucking car. If I get my fucking hands on him…Goddamn it, motherfucker.”</p>

<p>“He going to jail no matter what. No matter what he was going to jail.”</p>

<p>“You going to whoop his ass?” Branch said.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Boykin said. “He going to jail no matter what. No matter what he was going to jail.”</p>

<p>Ricky was gone by the time they got to the car.</p>

<p>“He did the right thing by fucking running,” Boykin said.</p>

<p>The cops were part of a special unit tasked with patrolling high-crime areas. The unit’s presence was heaviest in Ricky’s neighborhood, Memphis Town, a moniker bestowed in the 1940s by the black service members from the nearby Air Force base who declared that the juke joints and restaurants on 14th Avenue reminded them of Beale Street in Memphis.</p>

<p>By the time Ricky was growing up, those businesses had closed, along with most of the factories that employed a large swath of the city’s population, which had doubled from 1940 to 1980. A basketball star in high school, Ricky was well known around the neighborhood. He was charming and quick-witted, those who knew him say, and was always making people laugh. In his early twenties, he had a daughter. He made money dealing drugs. In June 2013, he sold weed and cocaine to a police informant and was indicted on two felony counts, charges that were pending the night he died.</p>

<p>Then-city council member Marty Turner and other Memphis Town residents accused the “hot spot” squad of harassing black residents. One man, Don Deloach, reached an undisclosed settlement with the city in October 2014 after four police cars pulled up to him early one morning in a Kmart parking lot. When Deloach demanded to be told what he’d done wrong, Boykin arrested him, according to court documents. Deloach, the Kmart manager, was there to open the store. The incident was captured by another officer’s body camera. Boykin’s camera was off, and he was suspended three days as a result.</p>

<p>Two months after that run-in with Ricky Ball, Boykin and his partner attempted to pull over a white Mercury. It was a little after 10 p.m. when the officers, in an unmarked patrol car, spotted the Mercury heading in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>Branch was at the wheel, Boykin beside him in the front, and in the back seat were Officer Yolanda Young, who was their supervisor, and Alisha Stanford, Boykin’s girlfriend. Stanford sometimes joined him on ride-alongs. The three cops said that they all saw that the Mercury’s back license plate light was out, and that there was a white woman in the driver’s seat.</p>

<p>The cops followed the car down the street, blue lights flashing, but the Mercury kept moving forward at a crawl, the three officers told state investigators. As they drew closer, the cops said they noticed a man in the front passenger’s seat. They also said his door was open slightly, a sign he planned to run. Boykin cracked his own door open and got ready to give chase. The car turned onto a residential street next to a vacant lot, hit a speed bump, then slowed even more. Ricky jumped out and ran. Boykin went after him. All three officers’ body cameras were off. Seconds later, Branch radioed dispatch: “Shots fired!”</p>

<p>It was dark, the closest streetlight nearly half a football field from the lot. Boykin would tell investigators that he tased Ricky on the street, a few feet from the car, and saw a gun in his hand when Ricky fell to the ground. Boykin said that he dropped his Taser and drew his own gun, as Ricky got back on his feet and took off running across the grassy lot. Boykin said that when Ricky was about 25 yards away, Ricky turned toward him and pointed a gun. That’s when Boykin opened fire. Two of the eight shots struck Ricky: one in the hip, another going through his arm and into his chest, hitting an artery.</p>

<p>Ricky kept running. Locals stepped out of stores and houses upon hearing the gunfire, curious to see what was happening. Two told me they heard Ricky shouting, “Help, they trying to kill me!” while he ran. The officers called for backup and searched the area. Ricky was still alive when an officer found him beneath a mobile home. Responding officers also found a gun, a pouch of weed, and a container of cocaine stashed in a cinder block hollow an arm’s reach from Ricky. Twenty-one minutes after the report of shots fired, paramedics arrived. Ricky was pronounced dead at the hospital.</p>

<p>“Help, they trying to kill me!”</p>

<p>The medical examiner concluded that the location of the bullet holes in Ricky’s body didn’t make clear whether he was pointing a gun when he was shot or whether he was just looking behind him while running. While some residents believe the gun was planted — it was registered under the name of a local cop who was securing the scene that night — the gun had been reported stolen from the cop’s house in a burglary two months before Ball’s death, police investigative reports confirm.</p>

<p>Within days of the shooting, investigators questioned Branch and Young, the two officers who were with Boykin. Both said they heard Boykin shout, “Gun! Gun! Gun!” but neither saw a weapon. Branch said his eyes were on the woman in the Mercury driver’s seat the whole time. Young said she observed Ricky looking back at them as he ran but she didn’t see anything in his hands. When investigators asked her if Boykin gave any commands to Ricky before firing, she said, “I didn’t hear nothing. Nothing but the shots.”</p>

<p>Ernesto Ball in Columbus, Mississippi.</p>

<p>On a recent afternoon in early June, the sky bright and the air sticky, Ernesto and I walked across the grassy lot where his cousin was shot, retracing those final, frantic steps past the big tree, across the ditch, around the half-vacant apartment row, and into the yard behind the mobile homes perched on cinder blocks. Ernesto knew the way because he’d followed the blood trail the morning after the shooting.</p>

<p>Oldest among his generation of cousins, Ernesto helped raise Ricky. After the birth of Ricky’s daughter six years ago, Ernesto shared babysitting responsibilities. When Ricky needed a place to stay, Ernesto let him and his girlfriend move into his house. And when Ricky died, it was Ernesto who spoke at city hall, led the marches, handled media requests, and educated himself on the court system that will decide whether or not his cousin was unjustly killed.</p>

<p>Laws covering police deadly force in most of the country trace back to British common law, written into early state penal codes when guns were less lethal and the death penalty was applied to burglary, sodomy, and slave rebellion, among other crimes.</p>

<p>As of 1984, it was legal in most states for an officer to fatally shoot any suspected felon attempting to flee. That year, a Memphis police officer killed 15-year-old Edward Garner. The officer, Elton Hymon, said he assumed Garner was unarmed but fired anyway because he spotted the boy running from the scene of a reported burglary attempt. The officer was not charged, but Garner’s father sued the city, and the case reached the Supreme Court, which ruled in 1985 that Garner’s Fourth Amendment rights had been violated. An officer can’t shoot somebody running from them unless they have “probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others,” the 6–3 majority opinion stated.</p>

<p>That standard, paired with another ruling four years later saying use of force must be “objectively reasonable,” set constitutional limits, but it doesn’t dictate criminal code. Mississippi is one of 16 states yet to update their police deadly force statutes to meet constitutional requirements, leaving judges and juries to make decisions based on a patchwork of legal standards that make it nearly impossible for an officer to be found guilty of murder or manslaughter. In another of those 16 states, South Carolina, a jury was unable to reach a verdict in the 2016 trial of an officer caught on video fatally shooting a fleeing, unarmed man in the back from yards away.</p>

<p>"Did the officer have other alternatives? Did the officer really put the sanctity of human life first?”</p>

<p>“People are outraged when juries return an acquittal, and they don’t realize jurors may have had genuine reasons to be divided or confused,” said Brandon Garrett, a law professor at Duke University. “Often it’s unfair to blame the law,” he said, but police deadly force law “really is genuinely confusing and out-of-date.”</p>

<p>Even in states with more restrictive use-of-force laws, a cop’s proclamation of fear can be enough to avoid prison, no matter the circumstances. The law generally “tells jurors to look through the eyes of the officers,” said Craig Futterman, a criminologist at the University of Chicago. “It doesn’t ask: Did the officer have other alternatives? Did the officer really put the sanctity of human life first?”</p>

<p>In the wake of the failed convictions of the past four years, elected officials and advocates for police accountability have set their sights on changing deadly force laws. State legislators in Washington have proposed eliminating a provision that absolves officers who kill unless there's proof they acted with “malice”; lawmakers in California introduced a bill to raise the standard for a justified police killing from “reasonable” to “necessary” and to require jurors to consider the role an officer played in escalating an encounter. If it passes, California would have the nation’s toughest law governing police use of deadly force.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>“We give police officers an extraordinary amount of power,” said Futterman. “There’s a reticence by most of society, jurors included, to find officers guilty of violating people’s rights because it would be a very scary world to most folks if people believe that the people we entrust to protect us are out there abusing us, which is sadly the reality for many black and brown communities.”</p>

<p>In many cases, the only sanctions an officer faces for a fatal shooting come through the city government, which can strip away jobs, wipe out pensions, and change department policies. Often, these local penalties are doled out long before a case makes it to trial — a dose of accountability to try to pacify an outraged public.</p>

<p>William Widmer for BuzzFeed News</p>

<p>Going against the wishes of Columbus Police Chief Tony Carleton, city council members fired Boykin two weeks after Ball’s death — not for the shooting, but for repeatedly violating department body camera rules, allowing his girlfriend to ride along without authorization, and posting a series of inappropriate memes on social media, including one that used the n-word. (His lawyer argued that the usage was intended as slang rather than as a pejorative.) Boykin had offered to resign, but the city council rejected it; as then-council member Marty Turner reasoned, allowing Boykin to quit would have made it easier for him to find a job with another police force.</p>

<p>Chief Carleton resigned the next day and soon took a job with the Oxford, Mississippi, police department. Over the next several weeks, an assistant chief and a narcotics officer also resigned. The hot spot task force was disbanded. The penalty for failure to turn on a body camera was lengthened from a three-day suspension to 10 days. And when Boykin sued, the city planned to let the case go to trial.</p>

<p>But two weeks before it was set to start, City Attorney Jeff Turnage shifted course. The city’s insurance company informed him that it preferred a settlement over risking a loss at trial or higher legal costs, he said.</p>

<p>In addition to the financial compensation, the city rescinded Boykin’s termination. “Our official position is that he resigned,” Turnage said. “And that we never technically fired him in the first place.”</p>

<p>To Ernesto and other black residents, the city seemed to be saying that it would have been better off had it never moved to punish Boykin.</p>

<p>Chris Shelton walks along the path that Ricky Ball took while fleeing police in the Memphis Town neighborhood of Columbus. Shelton was a witness to Ball's shooting.</p>

<p>Jurors don’t always give cops the benefit of the doubt. Of the thousands of fatal police shootings over the last decade, at least 21 have led to convictions, according to a BuzzFeed News review of media reports and a Washington Post database of recent police shootings. In some of those cases, eyewitness testimony was enough to convince a jury that an officer wasn’t justified in shooting.</p>

<p>One of the most important eyewitnesses in the Boykin case, Officer Yolanda Young — who said she saw no gun in Ricky’s hands — may not be able to speak in court. In the years since the shooting, she was diagnosed with cancer, suffered a series of strokes, and has been immobilized in a hospital, according to court documents. A judge must now decide whether her earlier statements to investigators will be admitted if she is unable to testify. Another witness, Chris Shelton — who drove past the scene as the shots were fired — lost touch with investigators after getting a new phone, before only recently tracking down the number to reach them. The more time passes, Ernesto fears, the more chance witnesses will drop out and memories will fade, putting doubt in jurors’ minds. There isn’t much physical evidence to help sway a jury.</p>

<p>No trial date has been set yet. Because the case was so well known locally, the judge ruled that the jurors would be selected from Walthall County, near the Louisiana border. Boykin still lives in Lowndes County, where Columbus is located, and works at an industrial plant just over the Alabama border, “making less money” than he did as a cop, his lawyer, Jeff Reynolds, told me. “Since he was a little boy, all he has ever wanted to do is be a police officer, so he very much looks forward to the day he can once again work as a law enforcement officer,” Reynolds said.</p>

<p>“Every time one of ‘em gets away with killing one of us, that just makes the rest of ‘em think they can do whatever they want.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ernesto has worried about the prospect of police intimidation. Days after he led the protest, he was pulled over by four cruisers, he said, and asked where he was coming from and where he was going without being told why he'd been stopped. Another time, he said, an officer pulled up beside him and said out an open window, “Don’t get shot,” before driving away. One night, he encountered an officer walking around the back of his house, shining a flashlight; the officer said he was in the area on a call, Ernesto said.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>What angers him now, when he thinks back to all that has happened in the years since his cousin was killed, is the aura of indignation and immunity emanating from many of the officers he sees. “Every time one of ‘em gets away with killing one of us, that just makes the rest of ‘em think they can do whatever they want,” he said. “This is why it keeps happening.”</p>

<p>He still can’t get out of his head the image of Boykin leaving the county jail after making his $20,000 bail. A line of supporters clapped and cheered him on, some of them in police or sheriff’s deputy uniforms. ●</p>

<h2 id="thetrumpadministrationchosetomisleadwhenquestionedaboutitsfamilyseparationpolicy">The Trump Administration Chose To Mislead When Questioned About Its Family Separation Policy</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-21</p>

<p>Melania Trump with Border Patrol officers in McAllen, Texas, on Thursday.</p>

<p>Although President Donald Trump says his administration will continue to enforce its “zero tolerance policy” at the border, administration officials spent Thursday issuing incomplete and conflicting statements about the effect of Wednesday’s executive order on the family separations — even as signs emerged at the border that policies, at least for some, are changing.</p>

<p>The Justice Department pushed back hard at news reports that the federal government had dropped charges against 17 migrants with children in McAllen, Texas, sending reporters a statement “attributable to the US Attorney’s Office” in the Southern District of Texas that the office “did not dismiss any immigration violation cases in McAllen federal court today.”</p>

<p>It went on to criticize the reporting: “Media reports alleging [Southern District of Texas] cases were dropped or dismissed are inaccurate and misleading.”</p>

<p>But the story was more complicated, as US Magistrate Judge Peter Ormsby made clear at an afternoon session in McAllen's federal courthouse, where he noted that the government “had intended to charge” the migrants but had decided not to proceed “as a result of” the executive order.</p>

<p>For clarification, James Sturgis — the assistant US attorney-in-charge at the McAllen Branch of the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas — told the judge, "[T]here was no dismissal of those cases [because] there was no prosecution sought. The court did not sign off or consider those complaints. They weren’t actual dismissals, but the prosecution is not sought on those 17 individuals in light of the executive order."</p>

<p>In other words, the charges didn’t need to be dismissed — because they'd never been brought.</p>

<p>A federal public defender said her office “had received complaints” for the 17, and that they'd been separated from their children, another sign that prosecution had been intended.</p>

<p>Asked about the disconnect between its statement and what actually happened in McAllen, the Justice Department provided no on-the-record comment.</p>

<p>Statements coming out of the Department of Homeland Security were no more clear.</p>

<p>“Family unity will be maintained for families apprehended crossing the border illegally, and they will be transferred together to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” a US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said in a statement to BuzzFeed News. However, the spokesperson also said that CBP would “continue to refer for prosecution adults who cross the border illegally” — an inconsistency that went unexplained.</p>

<p>After the Washington Post reported that an unnamed senior US Customs and Border Protection official had said that the agency would no longer refer migrant parents accused of crossing the border illegally for prosecution, attributing the change in policy to a resource issue, Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told BuzzFeed News that the “zero tolerance” policy remained in effect, and that prosecutors would continue to pursue all illegal entry cases.</p>

<p>That's been the position Trump and Sessions have emphasized all week. In announcing the executive order that purported to address the family separation issue on Wednesday, Trump explicitly said the administration’s policy was still “zero tolerance.”</p>

<p>But if the actions of the McAllen US Attorney's Office are a guide, the Justice Department's zero tolerance policy might still be in place, but with significantly less effect.</p>

<p>One part of the executive order that was clearly executed on Thursday was Trump's direction that Sessions file a request with a federal judge in California to amend a 1997 agreement, known as the Flores Settlement Agreement, that restricts the amount of time that children can stay in immigration detention. Based on previous court rulings, US officials understand the settlement to require that children be released — either to a parent, another appropriate adult, or a licensed nonsecure program — within 20 days.</p>

<p>That means that even if families are detained together, authorities would still have to release the children and, assuming they don’t also release the parents, separate families after 20 days so long as the Flores agreement is still in place, or absent any intervening action by Congress.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Justice Department filed its request to modify the settlement agreement to allow ICE to detain families together pending immigration proceedings.</p>

<p>But attempts to get DHS to clarify whether its new policy could be implemented if the modification of the Flores Settlement Agreement wasn't approved also went unanswered.</p>

<h2 id="donaldtrumpjustconnectedthefamilyseparationcrisistothetravelban">Donald Trump Just Connected The Family Separation Crisis To The Travel Ban</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p>In the midst of the crisis over family separation, President Donald Trump may have given ammunition to opponents of another White House policy: the travel ban.</p>

<p>"[W]e don't want people coming in from the Middle East through our border using children to get through the line," Trump said to reporters during a meeting with congressional leaders on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The statement came as part of an extended back-and-forth from Trump about his plans to address through an executive order (which he later issued) the administration's policy of separating migrant families at the border — the result of a new "zero tolerance policy" ordering 100% enforcement of immigration laws.</p>

<p>However, the statement also comes as the Supreme Court is considering the legality of Trump's third attempt at a travel ban — a decision the court is expected to announce before the end of June.</p>

<p>The two matters are separate, but the questions raised in the travel ban case — are the president's actions in this context reviewable, do they violate a nondiscrimination provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act, are they overly broad, and do they violate the Establishment Clause — are now questions the court will be answering in the context of the debate over the zero tolerance policy and its family-separation effects. And two of the justices likely to care about such institutional context are the two justices whose votes probably hold the key to the decision in the travel ban case: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy.</p>

<p>If there were any doubt that the issues and questions overlap, Trump made it explicit by connecting the family separation policy to his stated desire to reduce "people coming in from the Middle East" due to crime-related concerns.</p>

<p>Asked about photographs of children in government custody, separated from their parents, Trump said, "Yes. They affect everybody. Those images affect everybody. But I have to say, you have double standards. You have people that want absolute security and safety, and you have people that do look at the children, and then you have people like me, and I think most of the people in this room, that want both. We want the heart, but we also want strong borders, and we want no crime."</p>

<p>Then, he shifted: "We don't want crime in this country. We don't want people coming in — we don't want people coming in from the Middle East through our border using children to get through the line. We don't want that. We're doing too good of a job to allow that to happen. So we're not going to allow that to happen."</p>

<p>No reporter had mentioned the Middle East, the travel ban, or the Supreme Court case before Trump raised the issue of "people coming in from the Middle East."</p>

<p>In the course of oral arguments over the travel ban case in April, the justices focused questions on how far the president could go in singling out a broad group of people for disfavored immigration or travel treatment and how far back the justices could look — specifically, back to the campaign — when determining whether impermissible motives were behind the ban.</p>

<p>The history of the travel ban began in December 2015, when Trump called for "a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on." At points throughout the campaign, he changed his language — but he continued to press for some version of his promise.</p>

<p>At the end of his first week in office, Trump signed the travel ban executive order — barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries and halting the entire refugee program for a period of time. The executive order — implemented immediately and without notice — led to chaos at airports across the country and court orders halting enforcement of parts and eventually most of the ban.</p>

<p>In March 2017, Trump issued a second order — which he later referred to as a "watered down, politically correct version" of his initial ban. It, too, faced opposition from the courts, although the Supreme Court allowed it to go into effect in part. Finally, in September, Trump issued a third, narrower ban — one based, the administration argues, on a full review by federal agencies.</p>

<p>At oral arguments in April, the questions focused, as they often do, on the extremes: How far can the president go, and how far back can courts look if examining the president's motive for such an action?</p>

<p>Justice Elena Kagan asked at one point whether a president could, hypothetically, make virulently anti-Semitic statements throughout his campaign and in office and then ban all travelers from Israel.</p>

<p>Pressed on the point by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Solicitor General Noel Francisco — the Justice Department's top Supreme Court lawyer — said, "If the President actually did make that statement — I want to keep out a particular race or a particular religion, no matter what — that would undermine the facial legitimacy of the action."</p>

<p>Later, Roberts asked the lawyer representing those challenging the ban whether any animus expressed during a campaign would be able to be looked at by courts as a reason for barring an order "forever."</p>

<p>"No," Neal Katyal responded. Noting Trump's continued tweets and comments while in office on the topic, however, he continued, "I think the president could have disclaimed — you know, easily moved away from all of these statements ... but instead they embraced them. That's the difference."</p>

<h2 id="noimmediatechangesplannedforchildrenalreadyseparatedundertrumppolicyhhsofficialssay">No Immediate Changes Planned For Children Already Separated Under Trump Policy, HHS Officials Say</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/trump-children-immigration-no-changes-planned </p>

<p>Watched by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Vice President Mike Pence, President Donald Trump signs an executive order on immigration in the Oval Office of the White House on June 20, 2018.</p>

<p>As President Donald Trump traveled to a campaign rally in Duluth, Minnesota, the federal agencies responsible for implementing the executive order he signed Wednesday to address the family separation crisis at the border were left figuring out what's next.</p>

<p>Although the executive order signing followed days of national outcry over the policy, it was not immediately clear what effect the order would have on new migrant families crossing the border — and federal officials were unclear Wednesday night about whether there would be any changes for those families already separated.</p>

<p>On the question of what happens to the more than 2,000 children already separated from their parent or parents over the past two months, the initial answer from the Department of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for "unaccompanied" minors, was that nothing would change immediately.</p>

<p>"For the minors currently in the unaccompanied alien children program, the sponsorship process will proceed as usual," HHS spokesperson Kenneth Wolfe told BuzzFeed News.</p>

<p>Hours later, a more senior spokesperson said in a statement that Wolfe "misspoke earlier regarding the Executive Order signed today by the President." That spokesperson, Brian Marriott, went on to say, "It is still very early and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter" — while noting that "[r]eunification is always the ultimate goal."</p>

<p>Until reunification efforts are made, however, a majority of the minors will be placed with family members in the US or with other sponsors like friends who are willing to take them in.</p>

<p>While it is possible for a parent who has been prosecuted for illegal entry under the administration’s zero-tolerance policy to be a sponsor for the child once they’re released from immigration custody, that process could take months or years if the parent remains in federal custody until their case is finished.</p>

<p>“Once a parent is prosecuted and the child is placed in ORR custody, ICE will make every effort to reunite the child with the parent once the parent’s immigration case has been adjudicated,” according to a statement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>

<p>"Our focus is on continuing to provide quality services and care to the minors in HHS/ORR funded facilities and reunifying minors with a relative or appropriate sponsor as we have done since HHS inherited the program," Marriott said. "Reunification is always the ultimate goal of those entrusted with the care of UACs, and the administration is working towards that for those UACs currently in HHS custody." (The term "UACs," as used in this statement, would be the "unaccompanied alien children" who have been the central focus of the family separation crisis.)</p>

<p>The family separations came as a result of the Trump administration's "zero-tolerance policy" mandating strict enforcement of immigration laws. Under the policy, all migrants who cross the border illegally are to face criminal prosecution. Because those facing criminal prosecution are held in custody by the US Marshals Service, those parents are separated from their children — who are then reclassified as "unaccompanied alien children" and become the responsibility of the Office of Refugee Resettlement within HHS.</p>

<p>Under Wednesday's executive order, DHS is assigned the responsibility for keeping custody of families while criminal or administrative immigration proceedings are pending.</p>

<p>Trump has said the zero-tolerance policy will continue, however, and an existing court settlement limits federal authority to detain minors. While the executive order directs the attorney general to seek a modification of that settlement — the Flores Settlement Agreement — the court overseeing the case would need to approve the change. In the absence of such a modification (or congressional action), the administration could only detain families together for up to 20 days.</p>

<p>Beyond the legal questions are the practical ones: whether federal facilities were ready to house families. The executive order directs the secretary of defense to provide any existing facilities that could be used to detain families together, and to build more as needed; it also directs other agency heads to make facilities available for families while court cases are pending.</p>

<p>The Pentagon is looking at four US bases for the task: Fort Bliss, Goodfellow Air Force Base and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, and Little Rock Air Force Base in Arkansas. It was not immediately clear whether such bases could immediately house families and, if not, when they would be ready to do so.</p>

<p>A document publicly filed Wednesday in the criminal case against former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort sheds new light on the alleged illegal lobbying scheme prosecutors say Manafort organized on behalf of the Ukrainian government.</p>

<p>The document — an unredacted copy of a memo dated June 10, 2012, that was quickly replaced with a redacted version, but not before it was downloaded by BuzzFeed News — provided the names of European officials that a Manafort business associate intended to recruit to help lobby on Ukraine’s behalf. The memo identified former Austrian chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer as being involved in the alleged lobbying scheme, and names other officials whom the memo stated had not yet been contacted to join the group.</p>

<p>Under Manafort’s scheme, special counsel Robert Mueller’s office alleges, the officials, who were known as the “Hapsburg group,” would offer favorable opinions about Ukraine’s actions as if they were independent observers, when in fact they were being paid to do so.</p>

<p>According to the indictment, Manafort used at least four offshore accounts to wire more than 2 million euros (roughly $2.5 million in US dollars at the time) to pay the politicians.</p>

<p>Manafort is facing charges in the US District Court for the District of Columbia related to his previous work for former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, including failing to register as an agent for a foreign entity and making false statements. He is also facing a slew of financial charges in the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.</p>

<p>The 2012 memo was written for Manafort by Alan Friedman, a former business associate of Manafort's who was previously only referred to in court papers as “D1”; the New York Times first identified Friedman last week. The memo described the Hapsburg group as “a small chorus of high-level European third-party endorsers and politically credible friends who can act informally and without a formal government relationship between now and the end of the year.”</p>

<p>In the unredacted memo, Friedman wrote that he had spoken with Gusenbauer, and the former Austrian official was “willing to be discreet” and “understood completely and embraced the idea of what he called ‘underground commenting.’” Gusenbauer previously denied being involved in Manafort’s work in a statement to the BBC.</p>

<p>"I was not aware of the fact Mr Manafort was financing this activity and of course I was also not connected to his activities within the Ukraine," Gusenbauer told the BBC in February.</p>

<p>Gusenbauer did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.</p>

<p>The memo included a list of officials who Friedman wrote represented the “initial talent pool” that he and Gusenbauer had not spoken to yet but wanted to canvass, if Manafort approved.</p>

<p>“Led by former Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer of Austria, the other former leaders from Germany, Spain, Italy and France would have a private sector or NGO relationship, even disbursed via the Chancellor himself for us so as to be quite indirect,” the unredacted memo proposed.</p>

<p>Although it is not confirmed who the group recruited for its efforts, three people in the memo’s “talent pool” have been identified in federal filings as having participated in Manafort-led efforts: Gusenbauer, former Polish president Aleksander Kwaśniewski, and former Italian prime minister Romano Prodi.</p>

<p>Gusenbauer had plans to meet with Kwaśniewski, Friedman wrote in the 2012 memo, but he noted that Kwaśniewski had been appointed by the European Parliament to monitor the trial of former Ukrainian prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko — a political rival of Yanukovych — which would prevent him from participating in any “formal activity.” Gusenbauer planned to ask Kwaśniewski if he would be comfortable in the meantime “with some conference appearances and/or joint op-ed with Chancellor Gusenbauer in the next few months,” Friedman wrote.</p>

<p>Asked previously by the New York Times about his connection to Manafort, Kwaśniewski said in February that he had met Manafort “two or three times” when Manafort was an adviser to Yanukovych.</p>

<p>“The last time I saw Manafort was probably around the fall of 2013. He never paid us. I never had any financial relationship with him, and I never heard of the Hapsburg Group,” Kwaśniewski told the Times.</p>

<p>In a statement to BuzzFeed News following the publication of the unredacted memo, Kwaśniewski said that he first met Manafort in December 2012 in Kiev, and spoke with Manafort "several times" in 2013, including at conferences in Rome and Brussels about Ukraine. Their talks focused on Ukraine and removing "the fundamental obstacle" to a Ukraine-European Union association agreement, which was the release of political prisoners, including Tymoshenko.</p>

<p>Kwaśniewski said they had "hoped that Mr. Manafort would use his close relationship to Mr. President Yanukovych to help us resolve this problem." He said he last spoke with Manafort in mid-October 2013 and had no contact with him since then.</p>

<p>Prodi, for his part, told the New York Times earlier this year that he had worked with and been paid by Gusenbauer, but wasn’t aware of that money coming from Manafort.</p>

<p>In a 2017 filing under the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA, Mercury Public Affairs — one of the American lobbying groups hired by the Manafort-led European Centre for a Modern Ukraine — stated that among its work for the center in 2012 was to engage US elected officials at educational events that included Gusenbauer, Kwaśniewski, and Prodi as speakers.</p>

<p>Other officials listed in Friedman’s memo as part of the “talent pool” they would wish to seek out if Manafort approved included Belgian judge Jean-Paul Moerman, former German official Bodo Hombach, and Javier Solana, a Spanish official who served in senior positions with NATO and the European Union. Additionally, Friedman wrote in the memo that Gusenbauer was waiting to see the outcome of French parliamentary elections so they could verify “who is in and who is out of politics” before deciding who to seek out there.</p>

<p>Hombach provided a statement to BuzzFeed News in German, which was translated through Google Translate as: "I have never worked for this group, there is no relationship between me and this group, and the naming of my name in this context is inexplicable to me."</p>

<p>Solana declined an interview request, through a spokesperson. Prodi and Moerman did not immediately return requests for comment.</p>

<p>US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson earlier Wednesday had granted a request by Mueller’s office to partially unseal documents filed May 25, which included the 2012 memo as an exhibit. Prosecutors had asked that they be allowed to redact certain information in the exhibits “to protect the identities of witnesses providing information to the government, to protect personal identifying information, to protect the confidentiality of an ongoing investigation, and to protect uncharged individuals from public opprobrium.”</p>

<p>The filing Wednesday also included an unredacted exhibit that named Friedman and another former Manafort business associate who had been referred to in court papers as “D2,” Eckart Sager; that exhibit has also been replaced with a redacted version.</p>

<p>Prosecutors have accused Manafort and his longtime associate Konstantin Kilimnik of attempting to contact Friedman and Eckart in February "in an effort to secure materially false testimony." Prosecutors quoted one text message from Manafort to Friedman, which read, “We should talk. I have made clear that they worked in Europe.” According to Mueller’s office, Friedman told a federal investigator that he thought Manafort was trying to "suborn perjury" because Friedman knew the Hapsburg group worked in the United States.</p>

<p>Manafort and Kilimnik were charged in a superseding indictment returned by the federal grand jury in Washington on June 8.</p>

<p>A court representative told BuzzFeed News that the unredacted exhibits were filed on the public docket "due to a clerical error" and that it was "not the responsibility of either of the parties." A spokesperson for special counsel Mueller’s office did not immediately return requests for comment.</p>

<h2 id="thesupremecourtjustupheldohiosaggressiveprocessforpurgingvotersfromtherolls">The Supreme Court Just Upheld Ohio's Aggressive Process For Purging Voters From The Rolls</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p>Chris Geidner/BuzzFeed</p>

<p>The Supreme Court upheld Ohio's system for purging inactive voters from the rolls — a decision that could lead other states to implement its aggressive procedure that can be triggered after a person fails to vote in one federal election.</p>

<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote Monday's 5–4 decision for the court, which was split along ideological lines.</p>

<p>Under Ohio's system, voters who do not vote in a two-year period are sent a notice from the state. If they do not return the notice and then fail to vote for the next four years, their voter registration is canceled.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court held that the state's process did not violate federal law.</p>

<p>Ohio had argued that its process was based on a provision of the National Voter Registration Act that allows states to remove people from voting rolls based on the grounds that they moved.</p>

<p>The A. Philip Randolph Institute, which sued the state, argued that the state, in fact, violated a different provision — which says that a person cannot be removed from voter rolls simply for failing to vote.</p>

<p>The court ruled that the state only uses the failure to vote "as a rough way of identifying voters who may have moved," but that it actually begins the removal process by sending "a preaddressed, postage prepaid card to these individuals asking them to verify that they still reside at the same address."</p>

<p>The court rejected the challengers' argument that Ohio's system violates the "Failure-to-Vote Clause." The clause, Alito wrote, "simply forbids the use of nonvoting as the sole criterion for removing a registrant, and Ohio does not use it that way."</p>

<p>Justice Stephen Breyer summed up the dissenting justices' view that Monday's decision was an exercise in circular reasoning.</p>

<p>"Ohio, of course, says that it has a ground for believing that those persons they remove from the rolls have, in fact, changed their address, but the ground is the fact that the person did not vote — the very thing that the Failure- to-Vote Clause forbids Ohio to use as a basis for removing a registered voter from the registration roll," Breyer wrote on behalf of all four dissenting justices.</p>

<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor also wrote a separate dissent, noting her agreement with Breyer, but adding a focus on how she believed the court's opinion runs counter to the purpose of the National Voter Registration Act.</p>

<p>The court's majority, she wrote, "entirely ignores the history of voter suppression against which the NVRA was enacted and upholds a program that appears to further the very disenfranchisement of minority and low-income voters that Congress set out to eradicate."</p>

<p>It was this response that led Alito to his most dismissive remark in his opinion, stating that Sotomayor's dissent "says nothing about what is relevant in this case — namely, the language of the NVRA."</p>

<p>Paul Smith, who argued the case in January on behalf of the challengers to Ohio's law, called the decision "a setback for voting rights nationwide" in a statement.</p>

<p>"Our democracy weakens when states are permitted to take actions that discourage voter participation," Smith continued. "By constructing obstacles that make voting more difficult, Ohio is sending the wrong message to its citizens."</p>

<p>Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted, however, criticized the challenge — and urged other states to take up Ohio's system.</p>

<p>"Today’s decision is a victory for election integrity, and a defeat for those who use the federal court system to make election law across the country," Husted, currently running to be Ohio's next lieutenant governor, said. "This decision is validation of Ohio’s efforts to clean up the voter rolls and now with the blessing nation’s highest court, it can serve as a model for other states to use."</p>

<h2 id="supremecourtsideswithdefendantinmotorcyclesearchcasebuttwoconservativespushback">Supreme Court Sides With Defendant In Motorcycle Search Case — But Two Conservatives Push Back</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-29</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/2-conservative-justices-use-a-motorcycle-ruling-to-take-aim </p>

<p>Chris Geidner / BuzzFeed </p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled overwhelmingly in favor of a criminal defendant Tuesday in holding that a Virginia search of a man's motorcycle — parked in his driveway — was unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the court's two most conservative justices — Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito — laid out a divergent pair of visions for restricting legal rights against police searches: one that would limit people's protections against illegal searches conducted by state and local police and one that would provide less protection under the Fourth Amendment than any other current justice believes exists.</p>

<p>The case presented a rather straightforward question about what Fourth Amendment protections exist when a person's vehicle is searched when parked on private property adjacent to their house.</p>

<p>Police had probable cause to believe that Ryan Austin Collins' motorcycle — covered by a tarp at the top of the driveway in a space "enclosed on two sides by a brick wall ... and on the third side by the house" — was stolen. After walking up the driveway, uncovering the motorcycle, and getting the license and vehicle identification number, police confirmed that suspicion and arrested Collins.</p>

<p>The decision was a lopsided one, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor writing for the 8–1 majority that the warrantless search of Collins' motorcycle was not allowed under the "automobile exception" to the general requirement that police need a warrant to conduct a search at a person's home.</p>

<p>"[T]he ability visually to observe an area protected by the Fourth Amendment does not give officers the green light physically to intrude on it," Sotomayor wrote.</p>

<p>Under the "automobile exception," police generally can search a car if they have probable cause without needing to seek a warrant. This is so, the Supreme Court has ruled, because automobiles are so easily moved and because of "the pervasive regulation of vehicles" by governments. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled the exception applied here, making the search of Collins' motorcycle a legal one.</p>

<p>Calling it an "easy case," however, Sotomayor wrote that "the scope of the automobile exception extends no further than the automobile itself." Because a person's house and the nearby space — referred to as curtilage — are independently protected spaces under the Fourth Amendment, generally requiring a warrant to search, the "automobile exception" doesn't somehow make it OK to access that property to search it without a warrant.</p>

<p>"The automobile exception does not afford the necessary lawful right of access to search a vehicle parked within a home or its curtilage because it does not justify an intrusion on a person’s separate and substantial Fourth Amendment interest in his home and curtilage," she concluded for the court.</p>

<p>Thomas joined Sotomayor's opinion — he agreed that the police officer's actions clearly violated the Fourth Amendment — but nonetheless laid out a view that would fundamentally alter the rules that have applied to state and local policing in the United States since John F. Kennedy was president.</p>

<p>Turning to originalism and the Supremacy Clause, Thomas took issue with the effect of the exclusionary rule on the case. The rule was established by the Supreme Court and says that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment is suppressed — unable to be admitted — in any criminal trial.</p>

<p>Thomas presented a vision of the law that would allow states to admit evidence at trial that was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Noting that the "Founders would not have understood the logic of the exclusionary rule," because there was no such practice at the time, Thomas wrote that Supreme Court rulings made clear the rule is "not required by the Constitution." As such, he wrote, the Supremacy Clause — which raises federal law over state laws — should not apply to this situation, since the exclusionary rule is not based on the Constitution or a federal law.</p>

<p>Thus, Thomas wrote, "I am skeptical of this Court’s authority to impose the exclusionary rule on the States" — a decision the court made in 1961.</p>

<p>And he agreed with the court's ruling.</p>

<p>Alito was the only justice who believed the court got the Fourth Amendment ruling itself wrong.</p>

<p>In his dissenting opinion, Alito laid out a view of the Fourth Amendment that potentially could — if ever given effect — allow for a wider swath of warrantless police searches.</p>

<p>"[T]he Court’s strikingly unreasonable decision is based on a misunderstanding of Fourth Amendment basics," he wrote, focusing on the item searched — the motorcycle — and not the location of the search.</p>

<p>"[W]e should ask whether the reasons for the 'automobile exception' are any less valid in this new situation," he wrote, referencing the court's earlier cases on the topic. "Is the vehicle parked in the drive-way any less mobile? Are any greater privacy interests at stake? If the answer to those questions is 'no,' then the automobile exception should apply. And here, the answer to each question is emphatically 'no.'"</p>

<p>While Sotomayor noted that, under Alito's logic, the police officer in this case could have entered the home itself if he saw the motorcycle in the living room from the street, Alito himself insisted otherwise, writing that "a case-specific inquiry regarding the degree of intrusion on privacy is entirely appropriate when the motor vehicle to be searched is located on private property."</p>

<p>It was not clear what actual rule that would establish or how this sliding-rule application of the general warrant requirement for home searches would apply in other cases, but Alito summed up his own general view about Collins' case in the opening to his dissent: "The Fourth Amendment prohibits 'unreasonable' searches. What the police did in this case was entirely reasonable."</p>

<h2 id="democratssaytheresnoevidencefortrumpsspyclaimsafterclassifiedbriefings">Democrats Say There's "No Evidence" For Trump's Spy Claims After Classified Briefings</h2>

<p>White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, right, and White House lawyer Emmet Flood, left, arrive at the U.S. Capitol on May 24, 2018.</p>

<p>Congressional leaders on Thursday participated in an unusual pair of meetings with administration officials to discuss the FBI's use of an informant in its counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in 2016.</p>

<p>Democrats who attended the meetings said there was "no evidence" presented to support the claim repeatedly made by President Donald Trump in recent days that the FBI placed a "spy" in the Trump campaign. The meetings — which took place in different locations with overlapping but different attendees — were both led by FBI and DOJ officials and also included Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats.</p>

<p>The meetings came out of ongoing requests by two House Republicans — House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes and House Oversight Committee Chair Trey Gowdy — to review the classified materials related to an FBI informant. Multiple outlets have identified that informant as professor Stefan Halper, who reportedly met with three members of the Trump campaign: Carter Page, George Papadopoulos, and Sam Clovis during the campaign.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, Trump issued a "demand" that DOJ investigate whether surveillance of his campaign was conducted "for political purposes." That led to a Monday meeting between White House and DOJ officials, which in turn led to Thursday's meetings.</p>

<p>In the interim, Trump and Rudy Giuliani, his outside lawyer in the special counsel's investigation, have made an effort to characterize the situation as "Spygate" — with Trump repeatedly claiming, without evidence, that it could be "one of the biggest political scandals in history."</p>

<p>Initially, only a meeting for Nunes and Gowdy was planned, but Democrats and Senate Republicans questioned the move — leading to one briefing being set for Gowdy and Nunes and a second briefing for the "Gang of Eight," the House and Senate majority and minority leaders and both chambers' intelligence committee's leaders from each party. (There were more "musical chairs" changes in the run-up to the meetings: Gowdy was invited to both meetings; House Speaker Paul Ryan attended only the first meeting, due to a scheduling conflict; and Rep. Adam Schiff, the Ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, eventually was invited to attend both meetings as well.)</p>

<p>After the briefings, Schiff issued a statement on behalf of the Democrats. “Nothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the FBI or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the Trump campaign or otherwise failed to follow appropriate procedures or protocols,” he told reporters.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Nunes declined to comment on the meetings.</p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer; House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi; Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Richard Burr; and Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, also attended the second briefing.</p>

<p>White House press secretary Sarah Sanders had said earlier in the week that no White House staff members would attend the originally planned briefing for Nunes and Gowdy. But on Thursday, both White House chief of staff John Kelly and White House lawyer Emmet Flood, who recently took over from Ty Cobb as the White House's lead lawyer on the Russia investigation, attended both meetings.</p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon, Sanders said in a statement that Kelly and Flood attended "to facilitate" the meetings.</p>

<p>"Neither Chief Kelly nor Mr. Flood actually attended the meetings but did make brief remarks before the meetings started to relay the President’s desire for as much openness as possible under the law. They also conveyed the President’s understanding of the need to protect human intelligence services and the importance of communication between the branches of government," Sanders said. "After making their brief comments they departed before the meetings officially started."</p>

<p>Sen. Mark Warner confirmed that Kelly and Flood left before the second classified briefing began, but nonetheless raised concern. "There’s never been a gang of eight meeting with that kind of White House presence," he said, later tweeting that they had "no business" being there.</p>

<p>Mark Warner @MarkWarner</p>

<p>For the record, the President’s Chief of Staff and his attorney in an ongoing criminal investigation into the President’s campaign have no business showing up to a classified intelligence briefing.</p>

<p>Schiff went further in an individual statement, saying, "Emmet Flood's presence and statement at the outset of both meetings today was completely inappropriate. Although he did not participate in the meetings which followed, as the White House's attorney handling the Special Counsel's investigation, his involvement — in any capacity — was entirely improper, and I made this clear to him.</p>

<p>A Democratic aide said that multiple Democrats in the meeting confronted Flood and Kelly about "the inappropriateness of their presence."</p>

<p>Schiff also noted, "His presence only underscores what Rudy Giuliani said: the President's legal team expects to use information gleaned improperly from the Justice Department or the President's allies in Congress to their legal advantage."</p>

<p>Eric Schneiderman</p>

<p>A federal judge on Friday ordered a lawyer to provide a legal backing for a request related to the explosive claim that Michael Cohen — and possibly President Donald Trump — were aware of accusations against former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman since 2013.</p>

<p>The lawyer, Peter Gleason, did not respond to requests for comment, but he told the New York Times that he had spoken to Cohen, Trump's longtime personal lawyer, in 2013 about accusations that he says two women brought to him about Schneiderman, who resigned this week after the New Yorker reported allegations that he abused multiple women.</p>

<p>In a letter submitted to US District Judge Kimba Wood, who is hearing Cohen's request related to materials seized from his properties by federal agents on April 9, Gleason sought a court order to seal any documents seized in the raid that relate to communications about the two women.</p>

<p>"The extent of Mr. Cohen memorializing any of our conversations is unknown," Gleason wrote in the letter. "However, these two women's confidentiality, as victims of a sexual assault, should be superior to that of any unrelated subpoena."</p>

<p>Wood quickly responded, ordering Gleason to submit a memorandum of law supporting the request by May 18 or to withdraw the request.</p>

<p>In the letter, Gleason claimed that he went to a retired New York Post reporter, Steve Dunleavy, to discuss the claims and that Dunleavy "offered to discuss the matter with Donald Trump."</p>

<p>Gleason claimed that he then received a call from Cohen, which he took to mean that Dunleavy had spoken to Trump.</p>

<p>Dunleavy did not respond to a request from BuzzFeed News for comment, but told CNBC that he had never spoken to Trump or Cohen about the matter.</p>

<p>Gleason acknowledged in response that he didn't know who Dunleavy had spoken to but maintained that he received a call from Cohen after he had talked to Dunleavy about the women's accusations.</p>

<p>Asked if Trump had been made aware of allegations against Schneiderman in 2013, Rudy Giuliani, Trump's outside lawyer, told BuzzFeed News, "I've seen some correspondence on it" — a reference to Friday's letter — "but Jay [Sekulow] and I have not had a chance to talk to the president about it."</p>

<p>Given that Trump was not yet a public official at that point, Giuliani added, "I don't know if there is much that they could have done at that point."</p>

<p>Noting that Schneiderman had brought suit against Trump in August 2013, alleging that Trump University engaged in fraud, Giuliani said of the potential reasons for talking to Trump about the allegations, "Maybe he was hoping that could be of use to the president."</p>

<p>In September 2013, Trump did write a vague tweet about Schneiderman, asking if he was "a crook."</p>

<p>Weiner is gone, Spitzer is gone - next will be lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman. Is he a crook? Wait and see, worse than Spitzer or Weiner</p>

<p>Neither Cohen nor his lawyers responded to a request for comment on the claims.</p>

<p>Charles Clayman, one of the lawyers at Clayman &amp; Rosenberg representing Schneiderman, had no comment on the letter.</p>

<p>For their part, the New Yorker reporters involved in the initial Schneiderman story stated that the women in their story had no "ties" to Trump or Cohen and that they had "no knowledge of Gleason."</p>

<h2 id="thesupremecourtfinallyheardargumentsovertrumpstravelban">The Supreme Court Finally Heard Arguments Over Trump's Travel Ban</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-25</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/trumps-travel-ban-gets-a-hearing-at-the-supreme-court?utm_term=4ldqpia </p>

<p>Chris Geidner/BuzzFeed</p>

<p>The Supreme Court held its long-awaited arguments over President Donald Trump's third attempt at a travel ban Wednesday — signaling the difficult issues that the justices believe they are being asked to consider, but not how they are likely to rule.</p>

<p>The court appeared to be of two minds in the arguments, with the justices' questions showing clear concerns about weighing into presidential decisions related to national security, but also a willingness to probe at when the possibility of a discriminatory motive for presidential actions would justify barring those decisions from taking effect.</p>

<p>Could a president who has expressed "virulent anti-Semitism" get his cabinet to make a recommendation that he ban everyone from Israel and then do so? ("A very tough hypothetical," the Trump administration lawyer acknowledged.)</p>

<p>On the other hand, if intelligence agencies said they were certain that a group of Syrians were planning on bringing chemical weapons into the US on a certain date, could the president exclude all Syrians from entering the US on that date? ("He could," the challengers' lawyer said.)</p>

<p>The hourlong arguments often veered toward such big questions because the underlying case — coming out of Trump's campaign and presidency — forced consideration of those extremes.</p>

<p>After campaigning in support of a "Muslim ban" and signing an executive order on his eighth day in office to implement a ban on travel from several Muslim-majority nations, Trump's order was challenged and halted in court. After a second executive order was partially halted by courts, federal agencies undertook a review of the underlying process. Following that review, Trump in September 2017 issued a third, more limited ban. It included restrictions on travel from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen. Chad has since been removed from the list.</p>

<p>Unlike the previous bans, the Supreme Court allowed the third attempt to go into effect while the cases challenging it were proceeding in court — the first sign of a more uphill battle faced by the challengers to the third iteration.</p>

<p>Chris Geidner/BuzzFeed</p>

<p>Wednesday's arguments were the first time the justices had considered any of the bans in their entirety.</p>

<p>When Solicitor General Noel Francisco took to the podium a little past 10 a.m. to defend the ban, he focused on the "worldwide multiagency review" and the cabinet-level consideration that preceded Trump's third effort as the reason why the Supreme Court should not block the effort.</p>

<p>Francisco turned again and again to that process — explaining that the travel limitations are an attempt to apply diplomatic pressure to nations that the federal government has concluded do not provide sufficient information to vet travelers from those countries.</p>

<p>Neal Katyal, the Hogan Lovells partner representing Hawaii, countered that Congress had rejected any nationality-based ban, undercutting Trump's authority under law to do so.</p>

<p>Acknowledging in response to a question from Chief Justice John Roberts that the president would have broad authority to issue even a nationality-based ban in "emerging, fast-moving" crisis situations, Katyal countered that this was not that, saying that Trump had been in office for 460 days and had not even proposed legislation to Congress to address any long-range policy concerns he had on the topic addressed by the various orders.</p>

<p>He also argued that Trump's continued statements — including on Twitter that he wanted a "tougher" ban that wasn't politically correct — showed that his original intent, expressed during the campaign, remained at issue and should be considered in deciding the challengers' second argument: whether the ban violates the Establishment Clause.</p>

<p>The court is expected to issue a decision by the end of June.</p>

<p>People protest President Donald Trump's travel ban in New York City on Feb. 1, 2017.</p>

<p>US Customs and Border Protection stopped 1,903 people for secondary inspection in the 9 days it enforced President Donald Trump's first travel ban, a new document made public by the agency shows.</p>

<p>The vast majority of those stopped — 1,457 people — were lawful permanent residents, a group of people caught up in the confusion surrounding Trump's issuance of the order barring travel from seven Muslim-majority nations on Jan. 27, 2017, without warning.</p>

<p>Of the remaining 446 people subject to secondary inspection, more than a quarter of them — at least 134 — withdrew their entry request. Such a move would have required them to leave the country immediately.</p>

<p>Some aspects of Trump's order were challenged in court almost immediately, but it wasn't until Feb. 3, 2017, that US District Judge James Robart issued a nationwide temporary restraining order that blocked enforcement of the travel and refugee bans.</p>

<p>The 28-page CBP document, released in response to multiple Freedom of Information Act requests, states, "This document lists all Executive Order related travelers who were encountered at CBP primary inspection in the air, land, and sea environments from January 27, 2017 to February 4, 2017 and were referred for secondary inspection."</p>

<p>The document notes the "disposition" for the roughly 300 remaining people who were not permanent residents and were sent to secondary processing — many times just with reference to a code that appeared to refer to various visas or other federal provisions that could allow them entry. In other instances, though, the disposition was specific and did not allow entry. For example, 10 people were crew members of a boat, and they were detained on board the boat while it was in the US. Nine Syrians were detained after processing in Philadelphia, and one Iranian was detained after processing through Customs and Border Protection in Miami.</p>

<p>While the Department of Homeland Security initially said lawful permanent residents were not covered by the order, the White House overruled it — forcing their inclusion in the order but allowing them entry on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>A Jan. 28, 2017, Customs and Border Protection memo also released under FOIA detailed the process for granting waivers to lawful permanent residents: </p>

<p>Via documentcloud.org</p>

<p>By Jan. 29, however, then-secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly announced that lawful permanent resident status would be a "dispositive factor" in determining whether to grant waivers, except in rare circumstances. On Feb. 1, White House counsel Don McGahn went further, stating in a memo that lawful permanent residents didn't even need waivers because — as DHS had said in the first place — the provisions of the executive order "do not apply to such individuals."</p>

<p>More than three-quarters of those subjected to secondary inspection were lawful permanent residents, according to the document.</p>

<p>In response to the court opposition to Trump's first ban, the president signed a second, slightly narrower executive order — which faced similar court opposition. Then, in September 2017, he signed a presidential memorandum that was even more limited and addressed a slightly different list of countries. That faced some court opposition, but the US Supreme Court ultimately allowed the federal government to enforce that memorandum while it considered its legality. Arguments in that case are set for April.</p>

<p>The document detailing those stopped under the first travel ban was among thousands of pages made public about "Executive Orders on Travel" by CBP this week. At least one of the people who had requested the documents under FOIA was informed of the posting of the documents Friday afternoon. He tweeted about it, alerting BuzzFeed News to the new cache of documents.</p>

<h2 id="thesupremecourtjustsidedwithcriminaldefendantsintwocases">The Supreme Court Just Sided With Criminal Defendants In Two Cases</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-21</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/the-supreme-court-just-sided-with-criminal-defendants-in?utm_term=4ldqpia </p>

<p>Chris Geidner/BuzzFeed</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of criminal defendants in two cases Wednesday.</p>

<p>Justices rejected a higher standard set by a court for inmates seeking funds to challenge their conviction and a lower standard sought by the federal government for convicting people of obstructing IRS investigations.</p>

<p>In the first case, the justices unanimously held that the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit had set an incorrectly high standard for reviewing whether a death row inmate, Carlos Ayestas, can get funds to investigate claims that he received ineffective assistance from his lawyers earlier in his case.</p>

<p>Justice Samuel Alito wrote the court's opinion, holding that the 5th Circuit's standard that an inmate show a "substantial need" for, as Alito put it, "services provided by experts, investigators, and the like," was a higher — and therefore improper — standard than the "reasonably necessary" standard set forth in the law at question. The 5th Circuit covers Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.</p>

<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor concurred with Alito's decision, writing to add — in an opinion joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — that "there should be little doubt that Ayestas has satisfied" that lower, proper standard.</p>

<p>In the second case, the justices decided on a 7–2 vote to reverse the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit and narrowly interpret a criminal obstruction law regarding IRS investigations — a decision that will make it more difficult to convict people under the felony obstruction provision.</p>

<p>The court, in an opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer, ruled in favor of defendant Carlo Marinello's argument that the IRS obstruction law requires that the government prove the person charged engaged in the claimed conduct obstructing IRS work in regard to "a particular administrative proceeding, such as an investigation, an audit, or other targeted administrative action."</p>

<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Alito, dissented, writing that the obstruction statute says it applies to the whole IRS code and places no proceeding-related limits on its application. "The Court may well prefer a statute written that way, but that is not what Congress enacted," he stated in dissent.</p>

<p>The rulings came a day after the court ruled, at least temporarily, on the side of another criminal defendant — halting Missouri, on a 5–4 vote, from proceeding with the execution of Russell Bucklew. Bucklew's lawyers argue that the state's lethal injection plan — as applied to him specifically due to his particular health conditions — would violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishments.</p>

<p>The court issued a stay of execution for Bucklew while the justices decide whether to hear his case.</p>

<p>Chris Geidner/BuzzFeed</p>

<p>Twelve hours after President Trump called his attorney general's actions "DISGRACEFUL" in a morning tweet, Attorney General Jeff Sessions left a nearly two-hour dinner with two of his top lawyers — and the next two people in line to run the Justice Department should Sessions be fired or resign.</p>

<p>Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and Solicitor General Noel Francisco left Central Michel Richard, an upscale DC restaurant a block away from the Justice Department, a little before 9:30 p.m. Wednesday.</p>

<p>The trio had no comment regarding Trump's tweet, which attacked Sessions for his decision to refer allegations regarding abuse of the FISA warrant process to the department's inspector general. Axios first reported that the three men had gone to the very public dinner.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Sessions had issued a surprisingly confrontational response, saying his decision was part of the "appropriate process," and adding, "As long as I am the Attorney General, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this Department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution."</p>

<p>After dinner, however, Sessions wasn't commenting — including about his former fellow Alabama senator saying that he would resign if Trump treated him the way he treats Sessions. ("Absolutely not," Sen. Richard Shelby said, when asked on Fox News if he would stay under the circumstances faced by Sessions. "I wouldn't be anybody's whipping boy, I wouldn't be belittled because the president is saying he doesn't have any confidence in me.")</p>

<p>Shelby isn't alone. Trump's tweet led one conservative lawyer to reach out to BuzzFeed News Wednesday with his thoughts on the tweet.</p>

<p>"Even leaving aside its sheer baseness, this tweet is idiotic on multiple levels," the conservative lawyer, who at one point considered taking a job in the administration and still has close ties to it, told BuzzFeed News, providing a list of six reasons why:</p>

<p>"1. The most obvious—if it's really 'disgraceful,' then, well, you're the president, you can fire the AG.</p>

<p>"2. Or at least, if you have all these burning questions, you can call him.</p>

<p>"3. The IG is the perfect vehicle to ferret out wrongdoing. Not only is he respected and diligent—he unearthed the Strzok-Page emails, after all—but if he actually finds criminality, then you’ve got a politically bulletproof basis to prosecute.</p>

<p>"4. If you take the matter from the IG, it’s going to be handled by career prosecutors, and you’re not going to like them any more than any 'Obama guy,' and they’re going to take just as long.</p>

<p>"5. Since you don’t have a confirmed Criminal Division head, the confirmed political appointee in charge of those career lawyers would be your favorite 'Democrat' prosecutor, Rod Rosenstein, who reports to your 'disgraceful' AG. How's them apples?</p>

<p>"6. And by the way, the IG <em>is</em> a 'Justice Department lawyer.'"</p>

<p>"Multidimensionally reprehensible," the lawyer concluded.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — More than 13 months into the Trump administration, the Justice Department is now officially without its Senate-confirmed No. 3 in charge — a department where nine of the divisions or offices that reported to former associate attorney general Rachel Brand also lack a permanent leader.</p>

<p>Much attention over Brand’s departure has focused on the order of succession at the Justice Department — a recurring question given President Trump’s repeated lashing out at both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel’s Russia investigation.</p>

<p>Within the department itself, however, there is another issue that Brand leaving her job highlights: There are very few people serving in “permanent” roles in the Justice Department.</p>

<p>Brand — who oversaw a significant part of the Justice Department’s portfolio and had served in the Justice Department for several years of the George W. Bush administration — was confirmed by the Senate and seen as helping provide day-to-day stability in the department. With Brand out, Acting Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio, who joined the Justice Department for the first time a month into the Trump administration, has taken over her responsibilities for the time being.</p>

<p>Four of the five legal divisions Brand oversaw lack their own Senate-confirmed leader, a multiplying effect on her departure, and one that is echoed in the the offices that reported to Brand as well. That includes the Tax Division, amid significant changes to the US tax code passed into law by the Republican Congress last year, and the Civil Division, responsible for representing the president and other federal officials in many lawsuits filed against the administration.</p>

<p>A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the issue.</p>

<p>Former Justice Department officials told BuzzFeed News the situation isn’t a dramatic one, legally. Strong acting heads, who are widely respected, sometimes still can have great influence, of course. And some components have not had a Senate-confirmed leader for several years, including the Civil Rights Division (2013) or the Office on Violence Against Women (2012).</p>

<p>But in day-to-day interactions, people serving in acting roles understandably can have difficulties asserting themselves or their office’s priorities — particularly outside of their agency — in political and even policy discussions. And with fewer people in permanent roles, the Trump administration lacks the stability for good government, or for advancing an actual agenda, more than a year into the presidency.</p>

<p>This topic of vacancies at Justice is not new — NPR, the Washington Post, and Above the Law all wrote about the issue in the opening weeks of 2018, before Brand announced her departure. But Brand's departure adds a new importance to the wide breadth of vacancies in offices that reported to her.</p>

<p>For any administration, the first years are often the most productive in terms of advancing their agenda — and the continued slow pace of the Trump administration in filling roles with permanent leadership reflects the lack of a fully realized Trump administration and, in some cases here, an apparent disinterest in advancing some of the previously established functions of the department.</p>

<p>An acting assistant attorney general oversees the Civil Division, Civil Rights Division, and Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) currently. The Tax Division is being helmed by the principal deputy assistant attorney general — a consequence of there not yet even being a nominee for the position.</p>

<p>There are pending nominations for the three legal divisions with "acting" heads, at various stages in the Senate process. Eric Dreiband, Trump’s nominee to run the Civil Rights Division, and Jeffrey Bossert Clark, Trump’s ENRD nominee, are two of the three Justice Department nominations awaiting floor action in the Senate — along with Criminal Division nominee Brian Benczkowski. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not yet taken action to consider their nominations, however, focusing instead primarily on getting judicial nominees confirmed. Trump’s nominee to head the Civil Division, Jody Hunt, was only sent to the Senate initially in December after several months’ delay and, as a result, is much less far along: He has yet to receive a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>

<p>In all, of the legal divisions that reported to Brand, Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, running the Antitrust Division, is the only Senate-confirmed legal division head in place.</p>

<p>BuzzFeed / Justice Department / Via justice.gov </p>

<p>Within the offices that report to the associate attorney general, the situation is more stark.</p>

<p>Trump has not even nominated leaders for the Community Relations Service, Office of Justice Programs, or Office on Violence Against Women. (Given that the department’s budget proposal would eliminate the Community Relations Service, it appears that a nominee is unlikely to be coming anytime soon for that office.) Additionally, and as reported by the New York Times, the new administration has effectively closed the Office for Access to Justice. The Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS Office, currently has an acting director — even though the leadership of that office is appointed by the attorney general and so doesn’t have to go through the Senate confirmation process.</p>

<p>The only offices that report to the associate attorney general that have permanent heads are the Executive Office for the US Trustees and the Office of Information Policy — and they have been in their roles since the George W. Bush administration.</p>

<p>The final entity overseen by the associate attorney general is the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The two part-time commissioners serving currently were nominated by former president Obama and both have been serving for several years now.</p>

<h2 id="thesupremecourtwillhearacasechallengingtrumpsthirdtravelbanattempt">The Supreme Court Will Hear A Case Challenging Trump's Third Travel Ban Attempt</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-19</p>

<p>Amr Alfiky / Reuters</p>

<p>Protesters against the travel ban in New York City in December.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court will hear a challenge to President Trump's third attempt at his travel ban, the court announced on Friday.</p>

<p>The travel proclamation, signed in September, limited travel to the United States from eight countries — six of which are Muslim-majority nations. It was Trump's third attempt to limit travel to the US; the first two — which were executive orders — faced significant pushback from federal courts, although the Supreme Court ultimately allowed the second one to go into effect in part.</p>

<p>A district court had halted enforcement of the September ban nationwide in a lawsuit brought by Hawaii, but the Supreme Court issued an order allowing the Trump administration to enforce the ban while the administration appealed the ruling — a sign that a majority of the court believed the proclamation is likely, but not certain, to be found to be lawful.</p>

<p>In late December, the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled against the travel proclamation, upholding the lower court's injunction in part and setting up the Justice Department's request for Supreme Court review.</p>

<p>In addition to the questions raised in the Justice Department's brief of whether the case is justiciable (i.e. whether it can even be heard by the courts), whether the proclamation is allowed under federal immigration law, and whether the "global injunction" is too broad, the justices also asked the parties to "brief and argue" a question raised by Hawaii: whether the proclamation violates the Establishment Clause.</p>

<p>The case is to be argued in April, with a decision expected by June.</p>

<p>A second case challenging the travel proclamation also is pending before the US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, but given the stay from the Supreme Court and the fact that there is no opinion yet from the 4th Circuit, that case — brought by the ACLU — would seem to have taken a backseat to the Hawaii challenge.</p>

<p>The travel ban case, Trump v. Hawaii, was the only new case granted by the court on Friday.</p>

<p>Among other cases before the justices at their private conference on Friday, the court gave no notice of whether it would take up the Justice Department's request to review a ruling from the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit in the first challenge from an undocumented minor who was seeking an abortion while detained by federal officials.</p>

<h2 id="supremecourtagreestoheartexassappealofracialgerrymanderingchallenges">Supreme Court Agrees To Hear Texas's Appeal Of Racial Gerrymandering Challenges</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-12</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/supreme-court-agrees-to-hear-texas-appeal-of-racial?utm_term=4ldqpia </p>

<p>Chris Geidner/BuzzFeed</p>

<p>The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear cases over allegations that Texas's redistricting efforts violated voting rights laws and the Constitution — adding high-profile racial gerrymandering cases to a term that already includes at least two cases about how courts can address partisan gerrymandering.</p>

<p>The move sets up the court for a potential blockbuster term — setting standards on voting rights relating to redistricting — before the next nationwide round of redistricting begins after the 2020 Census.</p>

<p>The cases over Texas congressional maps and state House maps were two of a dozen matters that the Supreme Court announced on Friday it will be taking up.</p>

<p>Among the other cases the court agreed to hear are those addressing a long-standing Supreme Court precedent regarding out-of-state sales taxes, the constitutional role of Securities and Exchange Commission administrative law judges, and what courts must do to back up a decision not to grant a person a proportional sentence reduction under federal sentencing rules.</p>

<p>The Texas redistricting cases are appeals from a 107-page ruling of a three-judge district court panel from this past August. Law professor Rick Hasen from the University of California, Irvine, an election law expert, summarized the cases as "big, important, and exceedingly complex. ... Issues include violations of the Voting Rights Act, findings of unconstitutional racial gerrymandering, and a finding that Texas acted with racially discriminatory intent."</p>

<p>The court heard a case over a partisan gerrymandering challenge to Wisconsin redistricting efforts this past October and has agreed to hear a case over Maryland's redistricting. North Carolina's lawmakers have said they are appealing a third partisan gerrymandering case — decided earlier this week — to the justices as well.</p>

<h2 id="jeffsessionscuts25guidancedocumentsincludingsomeobamaeraantidiscriminationguidance">Jeff Sessions Cuts 25 "Guidance Documents," Including Some Obama-Era Anti-Discrimination Guidance</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Chris Geidner</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/jeff-sessions-cuts-25-guidance-documents-including-some?utm_term=4ldqpia </p>

<p>Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images </p>

<p>The Justice Department wiped a wide swath of "guidance documents" off the books on Thursday, withdrawing 25 documents — including one addressing integration of people with disabilities in state and local government programs and another on standards for assessing citizenship status discrimination.</p>

<p>The Justice Department, in announcing the move, stated the 25 documents were "unnecessary, inconsistent with existing law, or otherwise improper." Several — though not all of them — were issued during President Barack Obama's administration.</p>

<p>The move follows a February executive order from President Donald Trump seeking a broad review of regulatory actions across the federal government and a follow-up November memo from Attorney General Jeff Sessions focused on guidance documents — which the department criticized as being used to "evad[e] required rulemaking processes" too often.</p>

<p>"[A]ny guidance that is outdated, used to circumvent the regulatory process, or that improperly goes beyond what is provided for in statutes or regulation should not be given effect," Sessions said in a statement on Thursday. "That is why today, we are ending 25 examples of improper or unnecessary guidance documents identified by our Regulatory Reform Task Force led by our Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand."</p>

<p>The Justice Department formally announced that Sessions was withdrawing the more than two dozen "guidance" documents following a Washington Post report on the decision earlier Thursday evening.</p>

<p>The department did not state why each of the 25 were specifically selected to be withdrawn.</p>

<p>Ten of the withdrawn documents relate to the Americans With Disabilities Act; six are documents issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the remaining nine cover a range of topics — including a 2016 Obama-era effort highlighted in the Post's reporting "that asked local courts across the country to be wary of slapping poor defendants with fines and fees to fill their jurisdictions’ coffers."</p>

<p>One of the withdrawn ADA documents addressed the application of the "integration mandate" in the part of the ADA addressing state and local governments. The chair of the US Commission on Civil Rights, Catherine Lhamon, criticized the move on Twitter.</p>

<p>Another withdrawn Obama-era document was a 2012 letter that provided "some general guidelines regarding compliance with the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act" regarding legal permanent residents.</p>

<p>The news comes as President Trump continues to focus on cutting regulations — along with this week's passage of the tax bill and judicial confirmations — as key accomplishments in his first year in office.</p>

<p>President Trump's third attempt at implementing his travel ban — issued via a September proclamation — again violates federal law, a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled on Friday.</p>

<p>The court, however, will keep Friday's ruling on hold pending the outcome of any Supreme Court review sought by the Justice Department.</p>

<p>The 9th Circuit ruled in a lengthy decision that "the Proclamation’s indefinite entry suspensions constitute nationality discrimination in the issuance of immigrant visas," a ruling the panel concluded shows the challengers — including the state of Hawaii — had shown a likelihood that they would succeed in their lawsuit.</p>

<p>The court, which heard arguments earlier this month, narrowed the district court's prior injunction — which barred all enforcement of the travel ban against people from the six majority Muslim nations affected — to people from those six nations with "a credible bona fide relationship with the United States."</p>

<p>Those affected are people from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. Although North Korea and Venezuela also are included in the president's latest proclamation, the district court injunction did not halt enforcement of the ban against those from those countries, so they are not at issue in Friday's decision.</p>

<p>Because the underlying injunction itself is stayed pending the outcome of any petition for certiorari — under a prior Supreme Court order — the 9th Circuit likewise ruled that its Friday decision will remain stayed "pending Supreme Court review."</p>

<p>The case, as with other prior iterations of the ban, was considered before Judges Michael Daly Hawkins, Ronald Gould, and Richard Paez. The opinion was issued per curiam, or for the court, and not under the name of a specific judge.</p>

<p>In issuing their decision, the court ruled solely on the basis that Trump's order violated the Immigration and Nationality Act's nondiscrimination provision — and that the president "lacks independent constitutional authority to issue the Proclamation" under current circumstances.</p>

<p>Because it ruled on the statutory issue, the panel also held that "we need not and do not consider th[e] alternate constitutional" argument made by the challengers that the ban violates the Establishment Clause as a type of religion-based discrimination.</p>

<p>That issue — and Trump's tweets on the topic — were front and center in the other appellate arguments held on the third attempt at the travel ban. The US Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit heard its arguments en banc, or before the full court, two days after the 9th Circuit's arguments. The 4th Circuit is yet to issue its decision.</p>

<p>Friday's opinion was not issued without a hitch. A little more than an hour after the 9th Circuit's press office sent out the decision, the court sent a follow-up notice that the first opinion had been withdrawn and replaced. The ultimate resolution did not change, although there were slight changes made throughout the opinion.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear all of the distinctions, but the first paragraph of the opinion, for example, was changed from stating that that court was addressing Trump's effort to bar "over 150 million nationals of six Muslim-majority countries" to "over 150 million nationals of six designated countries."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court won't weigh in for now on whether existing civil rights laws protect LGBT people from discrimination, the court announced Monday morning.</p>

<p>The justices declined to review a woman's claim that she was discriminated against based on her sexual orientation — a case that would have required the justices to rule on the matter.</p>

<p>Jameka Evans, represented by Lambda Legal, had asked the justices to hear her case arguing that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects against sexual orientation discrimination because it is a type of sex discrimination barred under the law.</p>

<p>In 1979, a federal appeals court ruled that "[d]ischarge for homosexuality is not prohibited by Title VII." Since then, however, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and one federal appeals court — out of Chicago — have ruled that Title VII's sex discrimination ban does protect against sexual orientation discrimination.</p>

<p>When Evans brought her case, a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruled earlier this year that it was "bound to follow" that 1979 ruling "unless and until it is overruled by this court en banc or by the Supreme Court."</p>

<p>The appeals court turned down Evans request for en banc review — meaning, of the full court — which led to the request for Supreme Court review, which the court turned down on Monday.</p>

<p>The EEOC and courts also have been considering the related question, not raised in Evans' case, of whether gender identity discrimination — against transgender people — is banned under Title VII's sex discrimination ban. The Supreme Court is yet to consider that issue either.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court's decision not to hear Evans' appeal is not a ruling on the merits of her claim.</p>

<p>As law professor Anthony Kreis pointed out on Twitter, there are a few reasons why the court might prefer another case to resolve the question of Title VII coverage. For one, Evans' case is not over after the Supreme Court's decision. The appeals court ruled earlier that Evans still would be able to present a claim that she was discriminated against based on gender nonconformity.</p>

<p>Additionally, other people are raising the Title VII issue in other cases. One is pending now in the US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit, which heard arguments in the case in an en banc hearing earlier this fall.</p>

<p>Advocates behind Evans' petition, however, had been hoping to get the issue before the Supreme Court during the term underway currently — a prospect that now is out of reach and could become key, should the court be closely divided on the issue and Justice Anthony Kennedy or one of the more liberal justices leave the court before the matter is heard.</p>
