<p>As the Trump administration separates families at the border, NGOs are scrambling to help any way they can.</p>

<p>In the two months since the Trump administration announced its “zero-tolerance” policy on people crossing the border illegally, more than 2,000 children have been separated from their parents. There are no government mechanisms in place to reunite families after the parents and children are released from custody. As a result, much of the work has fallen to non-governmental organizations that have been providing legal counsel and helping family members in different detention centers locate each other.</p>

<p>Read: Trump Has Quietly Cut Legal Aid for Migrant Kids Separated from Parents </p>

<p>The public outrage in response to wrenching photos of crying children, stories of families torn apart, and the audio of migrant children crying in detention centers has prompted people to pass along petitions online and share Facebook fundraisers with the hopes that they’re doing something to help at a time when they feel helpless. This is a good impulse, advocates told me on Tuesday: Short of traveling to volunteer with an immigration advocacy NGO in person—a commitment few can make—supporting the organizations doing the work on the ground may be the most constructive and effective way to help.</p>

<p>“While family separation had been happening before the zero tolerance policy, it had not been happening at the scale which is it now,” said Megan McKenna of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), which is working with a children’s shelter in Seattle and scrambling to keep up with the volume. The biggest challenge is often finding parents. Sometimes, a parent has already been deported, leaving the child alone in a detention center in the US. “We don’t know what the parent’s wishes are for the child in their immigration case,” McKenna said. “Do they want they child to be deported? Do they want the child to try to go through the US immigration policy alone and apply for asylum? It’s a slow process. It’s all new.”</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>When a migrant family is separated at the border, the parent is sent to an adult detention center and assigned a number in the system. The child is assigned a number too, but it doesn’t correspond in any way with the parent’s number—according to organizations I spoke with, the government has no system for tracking families who arrived to the US together, or to document which child belongs to which parent. (The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to request for comment.)</p>

<p>Some children are too young to speak or know their last name. “The kids who are preverbal—how do you even tell them what’s happening?” McKenna said. “They ask us in some cases, Where is my parent? And we can’t necessarily tell them. How terrifying is that for a child, on top of putting them in a place where they don’t know anybody and they’re not free to come and go?”</p>

<p>Much of what KIND and similar organizations are doing is legwork: showing up at detention centers, instructing people of their rights, and taking names, in an attempt to track down parents and children and connect them. Government databases are often not up to date with information on who is where, compounding the challenge—like trying to locate a package at the post office without a tracking number, only the package is a child.</p>

<p>“If a child on their own is trying to find out where a parent is, it’s nearly impossible."</p>

<p>–Michelle Garza</p>

<p>The Texas Civil Rights Project works on the parent end of the equation, in adult detention facilities. “We learn the names of children from the parents in a very short period of time—a five- to seven-minute intake interview,” said Zenén Jaimes Pérez, TCRP’s communications director. Sometimes, the adult may have contact information for a family member already living in the US who can sponsor the child, and the organization will connect them with lawyers. But the intake process is overwhelming, Pérez said, “due to the sheer amount of families that have been separated in McAllen, Texas alone. Sometimes there are 30 adults in one sitting, sometimes there are 80.” In addition to donations, they are looking for volunteers with legal experience who speak Spanish, Mam, or K’iche’ (two Mayan languages spoken in Guatemala), who are able to travel to McAllen to help interview families.</p>

<p>“If a child on their own is trying to find out where a parent is, it’s nearly impossible,” said Michelle Garza, associate executive director of Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES). “With representation, it’s a little bit easier, but there is no database that exists that could help kids of an adult find that answer very quickly.”</p>

<p>The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has set up an 800 number for people to call to locate family members, but the number is only free within the US. If a person has been deported back to their country of origin, they have to pay for an international call, and many families have complained about the hold times. ICE has set up an online detainee locator, but it does not include people who are under 18.</p>

<p>RAICES’ Leaf Project is a fund set aside to release children from custody and provide representation (unlike in criminal courts, children and adults in these proceedings have no right to legal counsel). They also offer free representation to adults at two detention facilities in Texas, and have a reunification fund to pay bonds to get parents out of custody. “The minimum bond is about $500,” said Garza, “but we’ve seen many bonds which are extremely high. A week ago I paid a bond for a mother that was separated from her child that was $12,000. It might as well be $10 million.”</p>

<p>Garza said the bond amounts often seem arbitrary. Other funds RAICES raises go to travel costs, getting lawyers to the often out-of-the-way locations where the detention centers are located, or to court. (A recent fundraiser set up to benefit RAICES has raised more than $8 million on Facebook.)</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Separated family members are often seen in separate court hearings. “We’ll see a parent and a child who are escaping for the same reason—gang violence, an abusive spouse—it’s the same case,” said Garza. “You’re seeing adult fighting their case in immigration court along, and a child who is place in removal proceedings, fighting their case alone. They should be facing the court together and they can’t.”</p>

<p>“Even if families are released from detention and reunited, the path to seeking asylum in this country is a long and difficult one,” said Dorothy Tegeler, co-director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP), which provides emergency legal aid and support to refugees. “The Trump administration is working systematically to dismantle protections for asylum seekers piece by piece. Family separation and horrific abuses at the border are part of this, part of a larger project of attempting to strip away basic human rights for people who have come here to seek safety.”</p>

<h2 id="obamafinallyspokeoutagainsttrumpsfamilyseparationssortof">Obama Finally Spoke Out Against Trump's Family Separations, Sort Of</h2>

<p>by: Harry Cheadle</p>

<p>url: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xe3d5/obama-finally-spoke-out-against-trumps-family-separations-sort-of </p>

<p>"All of us were strangers once, too," the former president wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>For the past week, even as Donald Trump's policy of traumatically separating migrant children from parents at the southern border was widely condemned, including by members of his own party, even as the public pressure pushed Trump to reverse course by signing an executive order to end separations, Barack Obama was silent. The former president didn't even follow his wife Michelle's lead when she endorsed a Laura Bush Washington Post op-ed calling the separations "immoral." That changed Wednesday, hours before Trump signed his executive order, when Obama posted to Facebook to commemorate World Refugee Day:</p>

<p>app-facebook</p>

<p>Barack Obama</p>

<p>last Wednesday</p>

<p>Today is World Refugee Day.</p>

<p>If you've been fortunate enough to have been born in America, imagine for a moment if circumstance had placed you somewhere else. Imagine if you'd been born in a country where you grew up fearing for your life, and eventually the lives of your children. A place where you finally found yourself so desperate to flee persecution, violence, and suffering that you'd be willing to travel thousands of miles under cover of darkness, enduring dangerous cond...itions, propelled forward by that very human impulse to create for our kids a better life.</p>

<p>That's the reality for so many of the families whose plights we see and heart-rending cries we hear. And to watch those families broken apart in real time puts to us a very simple question: are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents’ arms, or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together? Do we look away, or do we choose to see something of ourselves and our children?</p>

<p>Our ability to imagine ourselves in the shoes of others, to say “there but for the grace of God go I,” is part of what makes us human. And to find a way to welcome the refugee and the immigrant – to be big enough and wise enough to uphold our laws and honor our values at the same time – is part of what makes us American. After all, almost all of us were strangers once, too. Whether our families crossed the Atlantic, the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we’re only here because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, how our last names sound, or the way we worship. To be an American is to have a shared commitment to an ideal – that all of us are created equal, and all of us deserve the chance to become something better.</p>

<p>That’s the legacy our parents and grandparents and generations before created for us, and it’s something we have to protect for the generations to come. But we have to do more than say “this isn’t who we are.” We have to prove it – through our policies, our laws, our actions, and our votes.</p>

<p>Obama's departure from the White House hasn't dulled what might have always been his greatest ability: making plaintive, powerful appeals to Americans' patriotism. "To watch those families broken apart in real time puts to us a very simple question," he wrote. "Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents’ arms, or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together? Do we look away, or do we choose to see something of ourselves and our children?"</p>

<p>Though it was an obvious rebuke to Trump, the Facebook post also steered clear of mentioning the president by name or even describing what was happening in any detail. Obama also declined to endorse any particular policy fix, instead just advocating in a vague way for compassion. This might be because he did not want to jump into the middle of a debate going on right now in Congress—or it might because Obama's own administration detained migrant families in hopes of deterring people from crossing the southern border illegally. That policy was widely criticized by immigration advocates and called "deplorable" by a judge who ordered the release of immigrant women and children held in detention in 2015. (Republicans have insisted the new family separation strategy is a continuation of what Obama was doing, but that's false; under Obama, parents and children were mostly kept together.)</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Does Obama regret that part of his presidency? Does he have a new idea about how to handle the stream of asylum seekers coming from Central America? Are there specific organizations or tactics he believes Americans should support to combat Trump's cruel policies? There are no answers to those (fairly obvious) questions in his Facebook post.</p>

<p>If Obama seems a little mushy and a little late in his opposition to a policy that some liberals are comparing to the Holocaust, it's of a piece with his career after the presidency. Highlights include a "kitesurfing adventure with Richard Branson," a share in a husband-wife $65 million book deal, and planned support for an anti-gerrymandering effort led by his former attorney general Eric Holder. Notably absent: Just about any of the Resistance-style agitating his admirers might have hoped for. Even when he was president, Obama dodged the partisan brawling so beloved by Trump—and, despite his background in community organizing, his administration often seemed to relish thumbing its collective nose at the activist left. Obama's post-presidency lull more generally "reflects one of the problems that constrained his presidency—his hesitation and resistance to getting down and dirty in the muck of partisan politics," wrote Princeton history professor Julian E. Zelizer in The Atlantic in March.</p>

<p>There are good reasons for a former chief executive not to mix it up with the current administration. The norm is for ex-presidents to fade gently away into the background and let their successors govern unmolested. Obama may not want to drown out other Democratic voices in the interest of growing the party. And maybe he genuinely doesn't want to invite more hatred and rage from the conservative media complex.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Still, as probably the most popular Democrat in the country, and a figure who will presumably be in politics for decades to come—he'll certainly come back for Democratic conventions to deliver more primetime speeches—Obama will face some scrutiny during each Trump-manufactured crisis. "We have to do more than say 'this isn’t who we are.' We have to prove it—through our policies, our laws, our actions, and our votes," Obama wrote on Facebook. It remains to be seen what actions he himself will actually take as Trump's presidency progresses, and the costs of his most radical policies come into focus.</p>

<p>Pretty dark timeline we're on, huh? Hawaii is a fiery vision of hell, the US-Mexico border is a shit show, and—wait, what's that? Up there, in the sky! A bird? A plane? A glimmer of ho—oh. Oh no. That, fellow inmates in this miserable prison of a world, is a drone with a flamethrower on it.</p>

<p>As you can see, it's spewing jets of fire at a power line, systematically disintegrating what appears to be some kind of gauzy net of debris. The contraption might seem like the work of real-life Bond villain Elon Musk, or the latest invention from Boston Dynamics destined to revolt on its masters and wage war on humankind. It's tough to say for sure—there's no word on where this one was filmed, or what kind of psychopath made it—but the machine could have been inflicted upon this Earth by, innocently enough, a Chinese power company.</p>

<p>According to Gizmodo, the electric company deploys the flame-throwing drones to clean shit off power lines that a construction guy would have a hard time reaching. But that's not what really matters here. What matters is that there are tiny, remote-controlled robot dragons just zipping around out there, and it's only a matter of time before they turn their deadly, precise fire cannons on the humans who brought them into this world. Sure, it's kind of cool to see what they can do to a dangly black thing on a power line. But behold the terror of what they can do to flesh:</p>

<p>So that's it, then. That's how it all ends. Giant robot men chase us down, their headless cyborg dogs fight us into submission, and we all go up in a column of drone flame. At this point—in a world this brutal—maybe just bring on the robot apocalypse already.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's move to end family separations won't solve the deeper problems plaguing the facilities housing adults and children. </p>

<p>As of Wednesday morning, the Trump administration seemed to be recalculating its cruel, widely criticized policy of separating migrant children from their parents at the border, with the president issuing an executive order that announced the administration would detain children and parents together from now on.</p>

<p>That does not mean that the crisis—which was manufactured by the administration from the beginning—is over, however. For one thing, thanks to a longstanding court ruling the government won't be able to detain families for longer than 20 days. For another, it doesn’t appear Donald Trump will be doing anything to address the broader problem of inhumane conditions in detention facilities where border crossers are housed.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s own inspector general criticized these conditions in a December report that documented the improper housing of detainees in facilities meant for people with criminal records, strip searches that violated standards, abusive behavior by guards, and frequent threats of segregation from the rest of the detainees.</p>

<p>Read: Trump Has Quietly Cut Legal Aid for Migrant Kids Separated from Parents </p>

<p>"Staff did not always tell detainees why they were being segregated, nor did they always communicate detainees’ rights in writing or provide appeal forms for those put in punitive lock-down or placed in segregation," the report found. "In multiple instances, detainees were disciplined, including being segregated or locked down in their cells, without adequate documentation in the detainee’s file to justify the disciplinary action."</p>

<p>More recently, the civil liberties observation organization Human Rights First released a review of conditions in Texas titled Ailing Justice: Texas, compiled after researchers toured eight immigrant detention facilities in the state, seven of which were run by private companies. Even as the Trump administration ramps up its war on immigration, with a renewed focus on criminalizing all border crossings, these problems may be getting worse.</p>

<p>"We're seeing a lot of unfortunate changes in the detention centers," Eleni Bakst, the lead author of the report, told me. "The inhumane conditions for adults are a result of an administrative use of detention as punitive, deterrent measure."</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>The scope of ICE detentions in Texas is staggering. At any time, Human RIghts First found, 11,000 people (mostly adults) are being detained in 22 facilities in the Lone Star State—well above the next two highest states, California and Georgia.</p>

<p>During Bakst's time volunteering at a family detention shelter—work unrelated to her report but done at the same time she was researching the facilities—she saw signs of regression among the children. Younger kids forgot their potty training and began sucking their thumbs again, while older children stayed attached to their parents as if they were toddlers. Even when children are with their families the trauma of being caged is enough to cause this sort of regression.</p>

<p>They might be considered the lucky ones. Children separated from their parents are placed in the custody of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal organization in charge of holding separated children under the Unaccompanied Alien Children Program.</p>

<p>"The United States taxpayer can no longer be responsible for being a surrogate parent for every would-be illegal immigrant who crosses our border," ORR told me in a statement. "Under our current immigration loopholes, if anyone under the age of 18 illegally enters the United States they will be placed into HHS custody and released into the interior of the United States, rather than returned home to their country of origin. This is open borders."</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Children are placed in facilities as far away as New York and can suffer treatment that sounds horrific and abusive. Recent reports describe children being forcibly injected with antipsychotic drugs and becoming suicidal from the trauma of separation. There are at least three "tender age" shelters where babies and very young children are held.</p>

<p>What Human Rights First found out about conditions in the eight Texas DHS facilities it reviewed was similarly disturbing: inhumane treatment, long waits for medical attention, "unnecessary, lengthy, and prolonged detention—sometimes for well over one year."</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the report found that family separation is causing lasting damage to both the parents and family members who see their children taken away and the children who are being separated from their families.</p>

<p>Experts from the American Pediatrics Association have called the practice "child abuse" and say the detention of children that such treatment can have long-lasting damaging effects on child development and mental and emotional health.</p>

<p>The trauma for parents separated from their children is compounded by the conditions they face in the detention centers, where detainees are subject to dire treatment. One thing that stuck out for Bakst in the facilities she visited was the lack of proper laundry or new clothing. Some detainees reported that they were not provided new undergarments upon arrival and that when clothes were taken to be washed they were both improperly cleaned and not returned to the right people.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>"In Laredo, every single woman said this caused vaginal infections and UTI," Bakst said, adding that she heard at other facilities about this practice leading to a number of rashes, infections, and communicable diseases.</p>

<p>One woman being held at the T. Don Hutto Residential Center, a women's detention center in Taylor, Texas, described to researchers being separated from her 21-month-year old son. It took two weeks before she was told where he was and whether he was OK.</p>

<p>"They put him in a car and he started to cry, but they closed the door and put me in another car," the woman told Bakst and her team. "I couldn’t go to him. It is so hard because he is so small, and he doesn’t understand. I wasn’t able to eat. I wasn’t able to sleep. My son’s deportation officer says he is crying all the time and screaming for me. I never imagined this would happen. I never imagined that I would come to this country and they would separate a mother from her baby."</p>

<p>That woman was recently released from DHS custody, said Bakst, who added she hopes the woman was reunited with her child.</p>

<p>Trump’s executive order may have been intended to address some of the objections many had to one of his most unpopular policies, but it’s hardly a panacea—on Wednesday, HHS said it was not planning on immediately reuniting families.</p>

<p>As of now, there are no plans to end the widespread detention of people crossing the southern border. That makes it more important than ever that the detention centers be clean, safe, and well managed.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>"These facilities need major oversight," said Bakst.</p>

<p>"Facebook posts aren’t enough," said an organizer. "If immigrant families can’t be comfortable, then we shouldn’t be either."</p>

<p>Jun 21 2018, 7:41pm</p>

<p>Protesters lie down in the road near the ICE facility.</p>

<p>Protesters began arriving at the nondescript building that functions as the Portland, Oregon home of ICE last Sunday afternoon. They came in response to the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy that resulted in at least 2,300 children being separated from their families at the border. The policy has inspired widespread anger since it was announced last month, but the demonstration in Portland was unusual for its longevity, passion, and effectiveness. Members of the Direct Action Alliance, Portland Assembly, Portland Democratic Socialists of America, and representatives from the National Lawyer’s Guild organized the #OccupyICEPDX action, which in its infancy had fewer than a dozen people, but by midnight Wednesday evening had swelled to an autonomous tent city of a few hundred people in about 50 shelters. And it’s had real results, shutting down the Portland ICE office, at least temporarily.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>In announcing the closure Wednesday—which means that even deportation appointments are delayed—ICE said that the move was made in response to “security concerns.” The agency did not specify when it would reopen.</p>

<p>The scene at the makeshift encampment along the railroad tracks abutting the ICE facility was a communal and jovial one when I visited, the surreal and wildly diverse scene akin to that of an incredibly woke music festival taking place in the Mad Max universe. People setting up new tents on Wednesday made jokes with other protesters, who welcomed them to the “neighborhood.” Kids frolicked about with parents in tow to hand out granola bars. A team with flashlights kept traffic flowing away from the swelling crowd that listened to speakers lit by a nearby candlelit vigil. A Spanish-language info tent had been erected to advise families who had appointments with ICE. There were even wooden cabinets someone had dragged from home and stocked neatly with first aid supplies and leftist literature, adding to the surreally homey feel of the festivities.</p>

<p>An excited, nervous energy permeated the camp, which is organized into sections that included a front desk of sorts complete with a map and a concierge directing newcomers, a first aid area, a family/kids area, and a improvised food court stocked with fruits, salads, coffee, dry goods, and enough pizza to feed a platoon—all of it donated by well-wishers, with more arriving every few hours. Port-a-potties, tents, and blankets have all been donated as well. Local ice cream purveyors 50 Licks dropped by twice in the scorching midday heat offering free scoops for all in attendance and promising to return. Organizers have even made a Google doc to provide up-to-the-minute updates on what is needed at the camp.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>“It’s been really inspiring to see all this support from the community,” Dan Freimark told me while manning the food station Wednesday night. “We have like 50 pizzas and a mountain of water here, people really came through with their support.”</p>

<p>Read: Migrants in Detention Are Suffering Widespread Abuse and Neglect </p>

<p>Donald Trump’s Wednesday decision to begin housing parents and children caught crossing the US border together was greeted with varying degrees of disdain by the gathered throng. Speaker after speaker reiterated a sentiment that was echoed throughout the camp: This victory was only the beginning and they weren’t going anywhere until the ICE office was closed permanently. This was a mere battle in a much larger war, it was roundly agreed; one of the aims of the group was to provide inspiration for like-minded people across the nation to take action. “When this office is closed, we’ll move on to Sheridan, and Tacoma after that!” one of the evening’s impassioned speakers promised to rising cheers, referring to other nearby ICE offices.</p>

<p>The hope among the Portland occupiers is that their successes will galvanize others into similar actions and that they’ll realize an escalation of tactics—well-organized tactics—is needed to make any kind of real impact. “If this doesn’t inspire more actions then we have failed,” founder of the group Portland’s Resistance and community organizer Greg McKelvey told me. “I think it should show the rest of the country that we are not powerless. The people have more power than ICE, we just need to act. Facebook posts aren’t enough. If immigrant families can’t be comfortable, then we shouldn’t be either. That’s what solidarity is.”</p>

<p>A sidewalk chalk slogan at the protest</p>

<p>If the success of the Portland protest is to be replicated throughout the country, spurring a nationwide “Occupy ICE” movement, confrontations with state and local authorities will become inevitable. Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler said Wednesday afternoon that he’d ordered the Portland Police Department to stand down in regards to the occupation in a series of strongly worded tweets, going so far as to call the policy being protested “an abomination” and reiterating Portland’s proud status as a sanctuary city. “I want to be very clear I do not want the @PortlandPolice to be engaged or sucked into a conflict, particularly from a federal agency that I believe is on the wrong track,” Wheeler wrote. “If they are looking for a bailout from this mayor, they are looking in the wrong place.”</p>

<p>Activists in most cities will likely not be afforded such leniency by local authorities. And it remains to be seen how the federal government will respond. The ICE facility remained closed on Thursday, though occupiers told me that DHS officials had shown up to take photos of the encampment.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>So far three Democratic Oregon state representatives—Rob Nosse, Sheri Malstrom, and Diego Hernandez—have agreed to make appearances at the encampment on Sunday, which will mark a week since the occupation began. As powerful a visual as an autonomous encampment successfully shuttering an ICE office may be, if this burgeoning new Occupy movement is to make any real headway, they’ll need the help of lawmakers to affect real change.</p>

<p>“I can’t predict the feds’ response but I know they will have to use city and state resources in some capacity. If our mayors and governors stand with us, we can make this very difficult for them,” McKelvey said. “If they have a heavy-handed response, it will bring more attention to our cause and more support.”</p>

<h2 id="talkingtothefilmmakerbehindourdoconwhitestudentsathistoricallyblackcolleges">Talking to the Filmmaker Behind Our Doc on White Students at Historically Black Colleges</h2>

<p>by: Beckett Mufson</p>

<p>Beckett Mufson</p>

<p>Jun 22 2018, 1:28pm</p>

<p>Tiago is a white freshman attending Morehouse College. It's the Atlanta institution where Martin Luther King, Jr., whose face is plastered on Tiago's dorm room wall, got his degree. The 18-year-old estimates he's one of three "non-traditional" students currently attending the school, and he's part of a growing trend. Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are paying the bills by recruiting more non-black students.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>VICE's Lee Adams visited Morehouse for the first episode of Minority Reports to see how Tiago, his peers, and the campus community are responding to the implications of this growing minority. We asked Adams why he wanted to tell this story.</p>

<p>VICE: What is Minority Reports about?</p>

<p>Lee Adams: Minority Reports is a series where we look at minority populations in places you wouldn’t expect to find them. It’s an effort to grant representation while also starting a conversation about really complicated things like race and privilege that people try to avoid. We want to address them head on.</p>

<p>Where did the idea for the show come from?</p>

<p>It came from the story in this first episode about the practice of historically black colleges and universities recruiting white and non-black students. Then we thought, “What if we did a whole show about people in places where you wouldn’t expect to find them? Where they’re existing as a minority, and stretching what and who a minority can be?" The first episode might be one of the first times you’ll see a white male as a minority in America.</p>

<p>How do you find your subjects?</p>

<p>That story was pitched to us by a writer named David Dent, a journalism professor at NYU. I said no, originally, because I didn’t want to go to a black school—a demographic the mainstream media often doesn’t cater to—as an extension of VICE and champion the one white perspective that exists there. But then I thought, “As a journalist, how can I be responsible about the way I tell this story so that it’s fair to the kid and it’s fair to the institution and fair to all the people who have gone there and continue to go there?”</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>When I met Tiago, he said, “I’m not just here because I got a scholarship. I'm not just here because it was down the street from my house. I don’t just leave every day after class and go home. I’m here. I’m engaged. I believe in the mission. I feel called to this school by the mission.”</p>

<p>That let me know this was our guy. I found someone who is the right type of non-black student who you would want to attract to a black school, if there is such a thing. I knew I could do this story with him. It was the right time, with the right person, in the right place.</p>

<p>For later episodes, we start with a question and then try to find out what the answer to that question is. It’s a lot of fucking Googling.</p>

<p>There’s a moment in the first episode where the students are pointing out the problem coming to their historically black college to tell the story of a white dude. Did making this documentary change how you felt about the story?</p>

<p>Yes and no. The number one question to consider was, “Why does he want to go to school here in the first place?” In my mind, an HBCU wouldn’t seem particularly attractive to a white person unless they were fascinated by black culture and saw it as an opportunity to see us in our “natural habitat,” which is fucking weird in and of itself. I was perplexed by that question.</p>

<p>When I got there and met Tiago, it changed my mind. I got it. I understood why he wanted to go there. If he’s really as woke as he seems to be, now he has to prove it. Just being there isn’t enough. He has to be engaged, and then take what this school has given him and apply it to his life in ways I couldn’t by virtue of the color of my skin. He’ll have to navigate those white spaces that he can freely navigate and initiate change. He’ll have to be the ally he says he wants to be. There’s a burden of proof on white students at black colleges to give something back and not just take something from this experience.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>White students could always go to Morehouse. But the school was designed to serve the black community in very specific ways. I think they will always do that, but the growing number of non-black students definitely alters what they do and how they do it. Not to say that it takes away from the service they provide to black communities, but the kids there now have an added responsibility to take this non-black person who has entered their space and help them understand the narrative of their lives. You go to a black school not only to receive a great education, but also to prepare yourself to enter a society that rejects you and doesn’t value you as intelligent and capable.</p>

<p>If you’re a white student entering that space, you’ve got to be prepared to not have an opinion for once and do a lot of listening. You’ll be welcomed regardless, because that’s how black people are. But you’ve got to be prepared for the fact that you’re affecting somebody’s experience in a potentially adverse way.</p>

<p>What was the biggest challenge you overcame to make this episode?</p>

<p>Justifying what I was doing to myself. I knew that if I spoke to the other students there, I was doing the right thing. I knew I had to keep it as balanced as I could, without inserting my own thoughts on what was happening. As a journalist, you want to make sure you’re telling the actual story as it is, and not as you see it or how you want it to be perceived. I knew as long as I was allowing the kids there to drive their own narrative, I was doing the right thing.</p>

<p>What are the most important components to include in a documentary dealing with racial tension?</p>

<p>It required brutal honesty on all sides and finding people who are brave enough to confront that. It’s easy to do one of these docs and wind up with everyone tiptoeing around the issue. People want to be nice to each other. They don’t want to say things that are controversial. They're worried about their own reputations. If we’re actually going to get somewhere, I need to take people out of their comfort zones—figuratively or literally—and address the issues.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>It’s hard to sit in front of a black professor and ask her if this is reverse racism, knowing that it’s going to trigger a negative response. That’s going to alter the dynamic of our relationship. Or spending a week with an all-white K-Pop band in Korea, feeling like it might be fucked up. What they're doing seemed a lot like cultural appropriation—and I agreed to spend a week with these dudes and hope they don’t hate me by the end of it! I need them to be open, but also honest. Honesty is the key to this show.</p>

<p>How do you remain impartial in these tricky situations?</p>

<p>Honestly, I have no idea. Having a sense of humor definitely helps. It's knowing when to ask the hard question, and it’s knowing how to ask the hard question. I don’t want to be combative. I don’t want to be biased. But I do have to get that honest answer. If someone’s bullshitting me, I’ve got call them on it. Dave Lavin, who hired me at VICE, told me being a journalist is like playing sports. It’s all about acting and reacting. You see what the defense gives you, you make a decision. If they behave one way, then you’ve got to already know your two or three next steps.</p>

<p>It’s a lot of preparation. You need to really know the story. You’ve got to have the stats, the facts, and the figures to back up your questions. And you need to be actually listening so that you’re ready to pivot one way or the other.</p>

<p>What else is coming down the line for Minority Reports?</p>

<p>There’s a mostly American, all-white K-Pop band in Korea, which is amazing. The next episode is about black professional bull riders. At the highest ranks in the world, the top 100, there was only one black professional bull rider. His name was Neil Holmes. He retired, but this new kid, Ezekiel Mitchell, is rising up the ranks.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>In a future episode, I really want to tackle policing. I’m not sure what aspect I’m going to focus on, but that’s where I’m starting and we’ll see where I end up.</p>

<p>How do you hope these stories will impact people?</p>

<p>I hope they agree with me. I hope they disagree with me. I hope they take this and talk about it and reimagine who can be a minority. I hope they understand that everyone has a story, regardless of what space they’re in. Maybe we shouldn’t be so quick to judge anyone. You don’t know why they’re there or what it took for them to get there. Whether that’s a bad cop, a black guy in an all-white space, a white guy in an all black space, or a K-Pop band that isn’t Korean. When you ask, “What are you doing here,” be prepared to actually listen to the answer. That’s the point of this show.</p>

<h2 id="millennialtrumpstafferslieabouttheirjobstogetdates">Millennial Trump Staffers Lie About Their Jobs to Get Dates</h2>

<p>by: River Donaghey</p>

<p>url: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywe9nv/dating-is-hard-for-millennial-trump-staffers-vgtrn </p>

<p>"I told people I was an auditor down on Wall Street."</p>

<p>The dating scene is pretty rough for conservatives in DC right now. It turns out that most millennials in the nation's capital aren't into people who support a racist, corrupt demagogue. Unsurprisingly, the people who willingly work for Trump are struggling to find love, too. But it looks like Trump staffers have discovered a new dating plan that comes right from their boss's playbook—blatantly lying.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>According to a new report from Politico, former and current millennial Trump staffers get so much shit when they bring up their jobs to potential suitors, many avoid copping to their White House gig for as long as possible.</p>

<p>While under normal circumstances, you could expect young White House officials to work their job titles into conversations at the earliest opportunity, the Trump crew has learned to use the types of dodges more commonly deployed by employees of the CIA. “I’ll just say I work for the federal government,” says a White House aide. After some conversations at bars on U Street and the Hill turned south when his Trump ties came up, one since-departed staffer has learned to reveal his White House past only as a last resort. “Even now, people have to ask five or six times before I say, ‘Yeah, I worked there,’” he says.</p>

<p>Or, when pressed, some will just make up a completely fictional career for themselves.</p>

<p>When being vague doesn’t cut it, staffers can always straight-up lie, as one young administration official learned to do while working out of New York during the campaign. “I told people I was an auditor down on Wall Street, and people just stopped asking me questions after that,” he recalls.</p>

<p>The new and inventive tactic of lying about who you are to trick someone into dating you may work in person, but it doesn't pay off as well on the dating apps. It turns out that it's a little harder to cloak your identity on Bumble.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>One beleaguered 31-year-old female administration official described at length her “very, very frequent” scraps with her matches on dating apps. “You do the small talk thing, and you have a very good conversation, and then they might say, ‘You didn’t vote for Trump, right?’” she says. “As soon as I say, ‘Of course I did,’ it just devolves into all-caps ‘HOW COULD YOU BE SUCH A RACIST AND A BIGOT?’ And ‘You’re going to take away your own birth control.’” In one recent star-crossed exchange, the official told a match she worked for the federal government. When he pushed, she revealed she was in the administration. He asked her, “Do you rip babies from their mothers and then send them to Mexico?”</p>

<p>And, really, no one can hide from Google.</p>

<p>Evasive answers will get you only so far, though, since many dating apps provide enough information for inquisitive users to sleuth out their matches’ identities. “I literally got the other day, ‘Thanks but no thanks. Just Googled you and it said you were a mouthpiece for the Trump administration. Go fuck yourself,’” says the official. It’s all enough to drive her and some of her colleagues away from at least some of the apps. “I’m no longer on Bumble,” she says.</p>

<p>As the young and un-sexed Trump staffers flee the normal avenues of dating, deleting their dating apps and steering clear of bars out of fear that mean liberals will heckle them or make them to listen to the audio of crying migrant children, they're forced to look to each other for companionship.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Unlike their predecessors, who made their mark on the city’s social scene, they largely keep to themselves, more likely to hop between intimate apartment gatherings than to hit the town. “Instead of folks looking outward,” explains one young White House aide, “more folks look inward.”</p>

<p>And sure, it must feel like a pretty bleak fate for all of DC's Young Undatables to accept defeat and fuck one another, but come on. The young White House staffers should feel lucky—at least they have careers that let them slug down bottles of Smirnoff Ice on the job or whatever.</p>

<p>George R.R. Martin wants to call the potential new series 'The Long Night,' hinting at a very bleak time in Westeros's history.</p>

<p>Game of Thrones, HBO's flagship series about zombies and dragons and families who fuck, will come to an end after its eighth and final season airs next year, but that probably won't be the last we'll see of Westeros. The network has been working on a whole bunch of GoT spinoffs since long before season seven dropped, and now, finally, it looks like one has a shot at actually becoming a series.</p>

<p>Last week, HBO announced that it has greenlit a pilot for the first prequel series, this one set "thousands of years" before the events of Game of Thrones. The upcoming series, if picked up, will reportedly cover everything from "the horrifying secrets of Westeros’s history to the true origin of the White Walkers, the mysteries of the East to the Starks of legend," according to a statement.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>And, sure, it sounds cool to get a Night King origin story or whatever, but HBO's synopsis is frustratingly vague. Luckily, GoT mastermind and champion beard-grower George R.R. Martin penned a blog post on Monday that gives some tantalizing details about the upcoming show.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a prequel, not a sequel. None of the characters or actors from GAME OF THRONES will appear in the new show. All of the successor shows we’ve been developing have been prequels, as I have mentioned before. This one really puts the PRE in prequel, since it is set not ninety years before GAME OF THRONES (like Dunk &amp; Egg), or a few hundred years, but rather ten thousand years (well, assuming the oral histories of the First Men are accurate, but there are maesters at the Citadel who insist it has only been half that long). We’re very early in the process, of course, with the pilot order just in, so we don’t have a director yet, or a cast, or a location, or even a title. (My vote would be THE LONG NIGHT, which says it all, but I’d be surprised if that’s where we end up. More likely HBO will want to work the phrase “game of thrones” in there somewhere. We’ll know sooner or later)</p>

<p>The first bit of his post just clarifies what we already knew: The new series is a prequel, and it takes place a long-ass time before the events of the original show. It's also still in its early stages, so there's no talent attached—save for the showrunner, Jane Goldman, who wrote the pilot. But that little tease about the show's potential title, The Long Night, does give hint about what's to come.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>"The Long Night" refers to a certain period of Game of Thrones history, a time millennia ago when winter came and lasted for decades. This is also, according to lore, the first time the White Walkers wreaked havoc on Westeros, too, inspiring the construction of the Wall and the creation of the Night's Watch. It was not a particularly great time.</p>

<p>"Thousands of years ago, there came a night that lasted a generation," Old Nan explained to Bran back in GoT's first season. "Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept, and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks... In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders, big as hounds."</p>

<p>This is apparently what we'll have to look forward to if HBO winds up liking the prequel's pilot. Get ready to see some giant spiders decimate the ancestors of all your favorite Game of Thrones characters!</p>

<h2 id="trumpillegallytearingupimportantdocumentsisperfectlystupid">Trump Illegally Tearing Up Important Documents Is Perfectly Stupid</h2>

<p>by: Eve Peyser</p>

<p>url: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ywexjv/trump-illegally-tearing-up-important-documents-is-perfectly-stupid </p>

<p>His pointless and impulsive habit explains so much about his presidency.</p>

<p>Eve Peyser</p>

<p>Jun 11 2018, 10:14pm</p>

<p>Image by author via Jeff Swensen/Getty Images</p>

<p>On Sunday, Politico published a story that is the most obvious and perfect metaphor for Donald Trump's time in office. According to former officials, the president has a "tendency to rip up documents he is legally required to preserve," and government employees are forced to tape them back together.</p>

<p>“I had a letter from Schumer—he tore it up,” Solomon Lartey, a former career government official who was fired abruptly in March for reasons that remain murky, explained to Politico. “It was the craziest thing ever. He ripped papers into tiny pieces.” Lartey and his team would spend their days using scotch tape to reconstruct the destroyed documents. (Records staffers were apparently still doing this labor this spring.)</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>The Presidential Records Act requires the White House to save any papers that the president touches and send them to the National Archives. But Trump has a longtime habit of tearing up paper once he's done with it and "White House aides realized early on that they were unable to stop Trump from ripping up paper after he was done with it and throwing it in the trash or on the floor," according to Politico. Because our 71-year-old president refuses to change his behavior, which is literally illegal, the White House employs a team of record management analysts to simply tape up the documents he destroys.</p>

<p>This is just another banal piece of news from the White House reminding us that Trump is a reality TV buffoon behind the scenes as well as in front of the cameras. Though this one is more on-the-nose than most of these stories, the message is always the same: The rest of the country is going to be left to clean up the mess he's making.</p>

<p>Trump is completely driven by his impulses and doesn't care if they make things needlessly difficult for other people—like the staffers who have to tape those papers together. There's no strategy involved in tearing up a document, and his public behavior rarely seems to be any more thoughtful. His anti-Muslim comments hurt his administration in court during arguments over his travel ban. His interference with the FBI was so crude and amateurish his GOP allies defended him by saying he didn't know what he was doing. More recently, he started a feud with Canada on his way to meet with North Korea. He likes to light a fire and then watch other people scramble to put it out. If anyone asks, the fire was Obama's fault, or something.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Trump's policies amount to little more than shredding paper. The real estate mogul hasn't been able to build anything, but is doing his best to demolish regulations and other policies designed to protect the most vulnerable Americans. He's doing all he can to sabotage the Affordable Care Act, he repealed the Clean Power Plan, and he pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord. His administration tore up the federal guidelines for how colleges must deal with sexual assault under Title IX. He killed the Iran deal, and is shredding protections for undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>Read: Trump's Rampant Corruption Will Actually Hurt Him Soon </p>

<p>This is most obvious when it comes to foreign policy, an area traditionally controlled by the executive branch and where Trump's every move can have world-altering consequences. So it's vaguely concerning that a senior White House official told The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg that, "We're America, bitch," is the official doctrine they're working off of. What does that look like in practice? "Donald Trump is pursuing policies that undermine the Western alliance, empower Russia and China, and demoralize freedom-seeking people around the world," is how Goldberg explains it. "The United States could be made weaker—perhaps permanently—by the implementation of the Trump Doctrine."</p>

<p>The damage Trump has unleashed, diplomatically and domestically, in less than two years will take much longer to remedy. It's easy to tear things apart than it is to stitch together. The metaphor of dedicated public servants tasked with taping together the president's shredded paper is too perfect; its triteness is cringeworthy. A frustrating side effect of the Trump era is how obviously stupid everything is. His behavior is so predictably selfish and impulsive that analyzing it feels futile. We know Trump acts only out of self-interest and impulse. We know Trump is a fool. We've known that since 2015 at the latest, and he's president anyway. We know his administration is a web of incompetence and corruption. And we know they're all getting away with it despite everything.</p>

<h2 id="thelongjourneytorememberoneofhistorysworstlynchingmassacres">The Long Journey to Remember One of History's Worst Lynching Massacres</h2>

<p>by: Michael Sainato</p>

<p>Mary Turner and her unborn baby were killed by a racist mob in 1918 in an atrocity that was nearly forgotten.</p>

<p>Michael Sainato</p>

<p>May 25 2018, 7:00am</p>

<p>Community members gather in front of the marker commemorating the lynching of Mary Turner and the other 1918 victims. Photos by author.</p>

<p>Exactly 100 years ago this month, a wave of lynchings swept through the area around Valdosta, in south Georgia. After the murder of a white farmer, a mob of nearly 300 white people went searching for the perpetrators and wound up killing 13 people—including a pregnant woman named Mary Turner and her unborn child—most of whom had no role in the murder. It was such a horrific event that hundreds of black people fled the area, and yet the atrocity wasn’t remembered with any marker or official commemoration until nearly a century later.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>We know about the lynchings today thanks to the contemporaneous accounts collected by NAACP investigator Walter White and a few local newspaper reports. The story that emerges is so horrifying you don’t want to think of it as happening just 100 years ago:</p>

<p>It began with Hampton Smith. An abusive white employer, Smith often had to resort to the debt peonage system as a way to find workers for his farm. Back then, it was common for cops to arrest black people on frivolous charges, then give them fines they couldn’t pay. But employers like Smith could pay off those fines, then force the black arrestees to work off their debt—a system that took the place of slavery in many parts of the South.</p>

<p>Read: America's New Lynching Memorial Is Gut-Wrenching, Gruesome, and Beautiful </p>

<p>It was in this system that after being issued a $30 fine for rolling dice, 19-year-old Sidney Johnson found himself under Smith’s thumb. When Johnson refused to show up to work one day due to an illness, Smith beat him even though Johnson had already worked off his fine. It was incidents like that one that led disgruntled workers to gather at the home of Mary and Hayes Turner, who had a lengthy history of grievances while working for Smith. (The farmer had beaten Mary Turner on several occasions.) During the May 13, 1918, meeting, Johnson supposedly directed the plot to murder Smith, which came to fruition three days later; another employee, William Head, allegedly stole a shotgun from Smith and gave it to Johnson to commit the murder. Smith’s wife was also shot by Johnson, but survived.</p>

<p>The shooting, along with false rumors that Smith’s wife was raped, led to a mob of nearly 300 white people to seek out anyone potentially involved in the crime. One of the mob leaders, an undertaker named Samuel McGowan, claimed that even if the Germans invaded the area (this was near the end of World War I) the lynchings would still be carried out.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>The resulting lynching massacre was one of the worst moments in a dark period of American history when black people were oppressed by the threat of organized mob violence. Events such as these have been memorialized in Alabama’s Lynching Museum, but they have also been more quietly commemorated by communities across the country that still bear the scars.</p>

<p>On Saturday a few dozen people, including several descendants of the victims, gathered at the Webb Miller Community Church in Hahira, Georgia, to mark the 100th anniversary of the lynching massacre. The Mary Turner Project, a group devoted to raising awareness of the 1918 events, have organized similar gatherings every year around the anniversary of the death of Mary Turner. The annual commemoration is a place to share and re-tell the victims’ stories and to help heal the lasting wounds.</p>

<p>“I don’t know a whole lot about the story because I was older when we found out about everything.” said Audrey Grant, the great-granddaughter of Mary Turner. “We would ask my grandmother different things. She would just hold her head down and say, ‘Well, they say the white folks killed my mama,’ and she wouldn’t talk about it.”</p>

<p>Head, the mob's first victim, was captured by the mob the day after Smith’s murder. Though the mob initially planned to gather each individual thought to be involved in the crime to lynch them as a group, Head was lynched shortly after his capture. They hanged him on an oak tree five miles outside Valdosta, then fired several bullets into his body. Will Thompson and Julius Jones were captured by separate mobs shortly after and similarly hanged, their bodies left dangling from the trees. Hayes Turner had been arrested for involvement in the murder plot and was being transported from one jail to another when 40 masked men kidnapped him and hanged him, too. Convicts were ordered to cut down the body and bury him two days later.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Eugene Rice, another Smith employee, was accused by the mob of attending the meeting to plot the murder, then captured and hanged. The mob then murdered another three men who were never identified. Chime Riley was hanged and then weighed down with clay turpentine cups and thrown in the Little River near Barney, Georgia. Simon Schuman was pulled out of his home by the mob near Berlin, Georgia, never to be seen again. None of these six men were involved in Smith’s murder but were rather encountered randomly by the lynch mob.</p>

<p>But the worst was yet to come. When the mob approached Mary Turner, the pregnant woman “apparently stated that her husband knew nothing of the plot to murder Smith, was not a party to the crime, that her husband’s hanging was unjust, and if she discovered the identities of the members of the mob she would swear out warrants against them,” wrote Christopher C. Meyers, a professor of history at Valdosta University, in a 2006 article in the Georgia Historical Quarterly. The Atlanta Journal reported at the time that Turner’s lynching was incited by her “unwise remarks… about the hanging of her husband.”</p>

<p>From Meyers’s account:</p>

<p>The mob tied her ankles together and hung her to a tree head down and gasoline from automobiles was poured over her. Turner’s clothing was burned off her body. A member of the mob produced a sharp knife and her stomach was laid open; her unborn child fell to the ground. Hundreds of bullets were then fired into Turner until she was barely recognizable as a human being. Both Turner and her child were buried about ten feet from the tree, the grave marked by a whiskey bottle with a cigar placed in the neck.</p>

<p>“The thing that is most disturbing about the incident of the lynchings is who could be so cold, heartless, and gruesome to murder someone for speaking up for justice and get up the very next day, attend someone’s church, and feel justified in what they did,” said Randy McClain, the great-nephew of Mary Turner. (His great-uncle William Head was also lynched.) “She stood for what she believed in. She fought for what she believed in. She was killed for what she believed in.”</p>

<p>Sidney Johnson managed to elude capture from the mob and law enforcement for a week, thanks to the assistance of a man named John Bryant. But Bryant ultimately tipped off the police. When caught, Johnson opened fire on the officers and was killed in the ensuing gun battle. The mob, dissatisfied with not having a direct hand in Johnson’s killing, tied his body to a car and dragged it through the streets of Valdosta, then transported it to Barney, where he was put on display and publicly burned.</p>

<p>No one was ever charged or reprimanded for any of this. None of the crimes were ever officially documented, even though their impact was such that NAACP investigator Walter White estimated 500 black people fled Lowndes County in their wake, part of the “Great Migration” out of the South that was at least partly a consequence of this kind of racist terrorism.</p>

<p>For decades, the stories of Mary Turner and the other victims were largely ignored, even within the local community. That began to change in 2007, when local resident John Rogers and former Valdosta University sociology professor Mark Patrick George founded the Mary Turner Project. “Even the families rarely talked about it,” Rogers told me. A couple weeks after they discovered the location where Mary Turner was lynched, Rogers and Mark worked together with students at Valdosta University and with descendants of the victims to start organizing historical documentation.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Today, a highway historical marker commemorates the atrocity, though even that effort was difficult. The Mary Turner Project fought with the Georgia Historical Society, which maintains and presides over the state of Georgia’s historical markers, for nearly two years over the text that would be included on the it. According to George, the historical society tried to insist Smith, the murdered white farmer, be named first on the list of victims. Georgia Historical Society Director of Programs Christy Crisp told me the marker text proposed by the society included Smith’s name, which would have happened to come first in discussing the sequence of events. (His name was ultimately left off the marker.)</p>

<p>Bullet holes in the marker.</p>

<p>In 2013, four years after the marker was erected, someone vandalized the plaque by shooting it five times. The Mary Turner Project turned down an offer from the Georgia Historical Society to replace the sign. George told me, “We think those bullet holes reflect something important, it reflects how some people still think about this.”</p>

<p>“Every community has atrocities,” said George. “People need to know their local history... We should tell the truth and have accurate history. The other part of it is we are in a white supremacist nation, it’s in our DNA, it’s 400 years old and hasn’t stopped at all. Donald Trump is the latest visible version of it.”</p>

<p>Seth Rogen has offered to voice Vancouver transit announcements instead of Morgan Freeman. Photos via Twitter/Instagram</p>

<p>This article originally appeared on VICE Canada.</p>

<p>The glee over the idea of Morgan Freeman’s voice making SkyTrain announcements in Vancouver this summer was short-lived, as a new CNN investigation revealed eight women have accused the actor of sexual harassment. </p>

<p>Freeman was slated to make announcements over the SkyTrain’s PA system at certain stops during the summer, which is part of a VISA campaign that will allow passengers to pay their fares via tapping. But following news reports about Freeman’s alleged misconduct, which includes accusations of unwanted touching and sexist comments, Vancouver’s transportation network TransLink announced it is rethinking using the actor’s voice.</p>

<p>Morgan Freeman Allegedly Grabbed Skirts and Ogled Women Like a 'Creepy Uncle' </p>

<p>Sixteen people have accused the actor of sexually harassing women, including eight who said they experienced inappropriate behavior themselves.</p>

<p>Vice vice.com / Drew Schwartz / May 24, 2018 </p>

<p>“In light of information we’ve learned through news stories this morning of serious allegations against actor Morgan Freeman, TransLink has decided to pause his voice announcements as part of a VISA ad campaign on the transit system,” the organization said in a statement issued Thursday.</p>

<p>Now it looks like Vancouver native Seth Rogen has a chance to take Freeman’s place. In response to a suggestion from The Province reporter Stephanie Ip, Rogen tweeted, “Yo, if they need a replacement now let me know.”</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>TransLink responded by tweeting “Thanks for the offer, Seth. Let’s DM and talk,” to which Rogen replied, “Hit me up.”</p>

<p>The voice of Bong is probably more appropriate for Vancouver than the voice of God anyway.</p>

<p>It looks like the feline, aptly named Rebel, still has eight lives left.</p>

<p>Ronda Rankin was whizzing down a stretch of interstate in Omaha, Nebraska, on Friday night when her daughter noticed something strange about the car next to them. There seemed to be some sort of round, fuzzy blur on the roof of the maroon minivan that was flying down the road at about 60 MPH. When they inched a little closer to the van, there was no mistaking it: The ball of fluff clinging onto the roof for dear life was, without a doubt, a cat.</p>

<p>😱 WHOA! A friend shared this video of a cat riding on top of this van going 60 mph on I-480 between Martha &amp; Farnam in Omaha Friday around 8:30 p.m. People in the van had no idea! "They were shocked and scared! They immediately pulled over.” Anyone know what happened to cat? 🙀 pic.twitter.com/b4xWxaqu3W</p>

<p>— Chinh Doan (@ChinhDoan) May 20, 2018</p>

<p>Side-by-side with the minivan, Rankin waved at it while her husband honked. "There's a cat on your roof!" Rankin mouthed, pointing up at it. "A cat on your roof!"</p>

<p>The minivan slowed down, veered off to the side of the highway, and disappeared behind them, taking the uncertain fate of the daredevil feline with it.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>But on Thursday, ABC affiliate KET7 managed to track down the cat's owners, and discovered that—miraculously—the cat, aptly named Rebel, was still alive. And he hadn't even gotten injured. Michelle Criger, the Rebel's owner, told KET7 she had no idea that he had been surfing on top of their van. Apparently the cat likes to hang out around the car, and Criger knows to look under the van and inside of it before she drives anywhere. But she didn't think to check on top of it—until the Rankins flagged her down.</p>

<p>"When I got him off the roof of the van, he wasn't scared at all," Criger told KET7. "He wasn't shaking, heart racing, nothing. We were more scared than him."</p>

<p>And so Rebel the cat lives on, presumably, as his name suggests, gearing up for his next death-defying feat of bravery. Maybe he'll graduate from hitchhiking and move on to scaling very tall telephone poles, or perhaps, feeling bit by the travel bug, he'll try to make his next getaway via plane. And why not? He's still got eight lives left.</p>

<h2 id="floridasrepublicangovernorisfightingtokeepajimcroweravotingsystem">Florida's Republican Governor Is Fighting to Keep a Jim Crow-Era Voting System</h2>

<p>by: Francisco Alvarado</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-18</p>

<p>url: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gym3mj/floridas-republican-governor-is-fighting-to-keep-a-jim-crow-era-voting-system </p>

<p>And it might help Rick Scott become the state's next senator.</p>

<p>Francisco Alvarado</p>

<p>Apr 18 2018, 6:04am</p>

<p>Florida’s nightmarish scheme for restoring voting rights to people convicted of serious crimes is in trouble.</p>

<p>In November, residents of the Sunshine State will vote on a constitutional amendment that would automatically grant more than a million ex-cons—excluding murderers and sex offenders—the right to vote. A successful grassroots petition drive gathered 799,000 signatures from registered voters to place the measure on the ballot, and it was supported by 67 percent of the state electorate, according to a February Quinnipiac University poll of 1,156 registered voters. The same month, US District Judge Mark Walker struck down Florida’s existing process for restoring voting rights to convicted criminals as unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>But Governor Rick Scott and Florida’s three elected cabinet members, all of whom who serve as members of the state’s clemency board, have refused to pull the plug on archaic, draconian practices blocking former criminals from taking part in democracy. On Monday, Attorney General Pam Bondi went so far as to ask the 11th US District Court of Appeals in Atlanta to stay Walker’s ruling, arguing a 30-day deadline the judge imposed on the Clemency Board to change its system was unfair. Two weeks ago, Bondi also filed a formal appeal of Walker’s ruling.</p>

<p>Spokespeople for Bondi, Chief Financial Officer Jim Patronis, and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, who is a Republican candidate for governor, did not respond to phone messages and emails seeking comment. But Governor Scott’s press secretary John Tupps railed against the federal court ruling in an emailed statement. “Judge Walker haphazardly ordered elected officials to change decades of practice in a matter of weeks,” Tupps argued. "This is completely reckless and does not give the victims of crimes the voice they deserve.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some black lawmakers and civil rights advocates argued the governor has a more nefarious—and cynical—motivation for refusing to change Florida’s clemency system: marginalizing disenfranchised African Americans, whose votes could be the difference as Scott tries to win a US Senate seat this year.</p>

<p>“The governor has a particular belief system that often causes him not to err on the side of marginalized communities,” Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum told me. “In this instance, I believe the governor and cabinet members have adopted policy that has a disproportionately negative impact on communities of color.”</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Susan MacManus, a University of South Florida political science professor, told me the public perception is that Scott is adamantly against restoring felons rights because it will lead to more registered Democrats on the rolls. "That is a theory that has been in existence since before the Florida situation and it is an assumption on the minds of many voters," she said.</p>

<p>Due to the state's clemency process, 21 percent of the state's African American population, which traditionally leans strongly Democratic, had been denied voting rights, according to a 2016 study by the Sentencing Project. That means more than one in five African Americans who were eligible to cast ballots in Florida could not due to a past felony conviction, according to the study.</p>

<p>Shortly after assuming office, Scott—along with Bondi, Putnam, and then-CFO Jeff Atwater—rewrote the rules for obtaining clemency, making Florida the hardest state in the country for ex-cons to regain their voting rights, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. The governor and the cabinet members essentially scrapped reforms by Scott’s predecessor, Charlie Crist, that automatically restored rights to non-violent offenders upon completion of their sentences.</p>

<p>As USA Today reported, Florida is unique nationwide in requiring ex-felons wait a minimum of five years before they can apply for clemency. Other barriers include requiring former inmates to remain crime-free during the waiting period and obtain certified copies of court documents for each conviction. That isn't necessarily a simple task if the offender in question was locked up for years or longer.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Even then, it’s up to Scott and his cabinet members to decide whether or not a felon gets their voting rights restored. The numbers paint a stark picture: Between 2011 and 2015, Scott’s administration had only restored voting rights to fewer than 2,000 ex-felons and the disenfranchised population grew from 150,000 to over 1.6 million, according to the Brennan Center.</p>

<p>Gillum, a Democratic candidate to replace Scott next year, suggested that Scott was refusing to comply with the Walker ruling and in so doing blocking a potential wave of new Democratic voters from casting ballots this November. That, in turn, could increase his own chances of unseating incumbent Bill Nelson. “A federal judge ordered Scott and his cabinet to reform the current process and come up with a new set of guidelines,” Gillum said. “They have not taken any action since February and now they want an additional delay to maintain business as usual.”</p>

<p>In his ruling, Walker also noted that the clemency board’s decision-making process took on racial and partisan undertones. The judge pointed to the clemency application of Steven Warner, a white ex-con who cast an illegal ballot in Florida’s 2010 election. When Warner went before the clemency board three years later, he explained that he voted for Scott.</p>

<p>“The governor laughed [and said,] ‘I probably shouldn’t respond to that,’” Walker wrote. “A few seconds passed. The governor then granted the former felon his voting rights. But Plaintiffs identify five former felons who, at other points, were questioned about illegal ballots cast and then rejected on that basis. It is not lost on this Court that four of the five rejected applicants are African-American.”</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Tupps scoffed at the criticisms that Scott’s challenge to the Walker ruling was all about keeping blacks away from the polls. “The Governor will always stand with victims of crimes, not the criminals that commit heinous acts,” the spokesman insisted. “Let’s remember, these criminals include those convicted of crimes like murder, violence against children and domestic violence.”</p>

<p>Still, Scott has compiled a compelling track record of initiating policy that hurts Florida’s African Americans, nearly 24 percent of whom lived in poverty, according to a 2016 state study. In 2011, Scott proposed a budget that wiped out state funding for two historically black colleges. He also followed through on a campaign promise to require welfare recipients to undergo drug testing to receive benefits, playing into the awful stereotype that black people who receive government assistance are freeloading drug addicts. During a years-long fight with the American Civil Liberties Union in the state, two federal courts deemed drug testing welfare recipients unconstitutional.</p>

<p>A 2014 Tampa Bay Times investigation also found that Scott appointed far fewer African Americans to judgeships than his fellow Republican predecessors Crist and Jeb Bush. During a nearly four-year span, Scott only named nine black judges compared to 34 appointed by the two previous governors in roughly the same timeframe. And in September of last year, the Florida Legislative Black Caucus accused Scott of suppressing the black vote for a special election in a part of south Miami-Dade that had been hit by Hurricane Irma. (He had declined their request to postpone the election.)</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>When it comes to the clemency board’s process for restoring felons rights, inmate data from the Florida Department of Corrections shows it has more of a negative impact on African Americans than any other ethnic group, according to Mark Schlakman, senior program director for Florida State University’s Center for the Advancement of Human Rights.</p>

<p>“Regardless of the intent, it is incontrovertible that Florida’s highly restrictive civil rights restoration policies disproportionately impact minorities, more specifically those identified as black, when one reviews Florida Department of Corrections statistics,” Schlakman told me. “I think the underlying policies and implications of those policies certainly are cause for concern.”</p>

<p>According to statistics compiled using Florida Department of Corrections data by the Sentencing Project, the black imprisonment rate in the state is 1,621 per 100,000 people, while the white imprisonment rate is 448 per 100,000. Still, Schlakman wasn’t convinced that denying so many felons the right to vote gave one political party an advantage over others. “Those popular narratives that more routine voting rights restoration helps one party are not necessarily well-founded despite Democratic voting trends,” Schlakman said. “It is bit more complex because the majority of Florida ex-felons are white.”</p>

<p>Jon Sherman, senior counsel with the Fair Elections Legal Network, which represents plaintiffs whose lawsuit helped put Scott's clemency scheme on the chopping block, said the 1.6 million ex-felons who can’t vote represent more than 10 percent of Florida’s adult population. “It may have started in the 19th Century as Jim Crow laws to suppress turnout,” Sherman said. “But today it has metastasized into this cancer that affects everyone; Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians and Independents. It is not any particular group.”</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Desmond Meade, an ex-felon who leads Floridians for a Fair Democracy, the group behind the constitutional amendment petition drive, agreed that despite a handful of GOP power players in the state holding out, the cause seems to be going mainstream. “I was recently at a meeting full of conservatives who solely supported the citizens initiative,” Meade said. “We did this in spite of the politics. We are going to set an example of how we can transcend political and racial lines for the good of the people.”</p>

<h2 id="isthistheendofsolitaryconfinement">Is This the End of Solitary Confinement?</h2>

<p>by: Adam Lewis</p>

<p>date: 2017-01-04</p>

<p>url: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/evq7bz/is-this-the-end-of-solitary-confinement </p>

<p>A look at the future of this damaging practice.</p>

<p>Adam Lewis</p>

<p>Jan 4 2017, 5:00pm</p>

<p>VICE producer James Burns has been livestreaming his monthlong stay in solitary confinement since December 12, 2016, to drive attention to the use of this form of punishment in US prisons. </p>

<p>Not that facts matter anymore, but back when they used to, they had a remarkable ability to drive policy change during public health emergencies, even among unpopular groups of patients. Look no further than famous fact-denier Mike Pence, whose solution of "praying the virus away" was failing to control an HIV outbreak among heroin users in Indiana. Eventually swayed by studies showing that distributing clean needles was the most effective infection-prevention policy, Governor Pence begrudgingly bowed to the altar of fact and lifted the state's ban on needle-exchange programs, slowing the HIV crisis.</p>

<p>You don't have to be a brain surgeon (or epidemiologist, as it were) to see how acting on basic public health knowledge can go a long way in keeping society healthy, even the parts of society we tend to cast aside. It's no surprise then that our failure to act on the facts around solitary confinement has led to a mental health epidemic that reaches well beyond the prison walls. This is the central focus of VICE's ongoing project streaming live from a solitary cell.</p>

<p>In the US today, there are nearly 100,000 inmates in solitary confinement, where they spend all but an hour a day in a six-by-nine-foot cell, in total isolation. While some solitary sentences—determined not by a court, but by a jury of one's guards—could last a few days, many continue for years, and almost all produce an inmate in worse psychological condition than when he entered. Since most prisoners will eventually walk free, the current use of solitary has yielded a breeding ground for mental illness that affects millions of Americans.</p>

<p>Far from an issue that flies under the public health radar, solitary's disastrous effects on mental health have been documented for centuries. In the early 1800s, the US pioneered the practice as a "more humane" form of incarceration, but the results were devastating. Early studies, supported by observations from Charles Dickens to the Supreme Court, found that rather than rehabilitating inmates, solitary destroyed their mental health. Indeed, as one expert puts it, "[n]early every scientific inquiry into the effects of solitary confinement over the past 150 years has concluded that subjecting an individual to more than ten days of involuntary segregation results in a distinct set of emotional, cognitive, social and physical pathologies."</p>

<p>The US abandoned the practice for most of the 20th century until the 1970s and 80s, when prison populations ballooned as a result of the War on Drugs and a national push toward mass incarceration. Prisons soon returned to solitary confinement as an inmate-management strategy.</p>

<p>"The use of solitary tracks directly with the rise in mass incarceration," says Jean Casella, co-director of Solitary Watch, a watchdog group that tracks solitary confinement in the US. "Up until the 1980s, there was at least some lip service paid to rehabilitation. Then things became all about control and punishment. And eventually the practice of solitary confinement became the control measure of first resort."</p>

<p>This punitive isolation wreaks havoc on inmates' brains with virtually no evidence of reducing violence, explains Terry Kupers, a clinical psychiatrist and author of the forthcoming book Solitary: The Inside Story of Supermax Isolation and How We Can Abolish It.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>"Stable prisoners who enter solitary will almost immediately develop anxiety, paranoia, compulsive behavior, memory loss, anger, despair, and suicidal thoughts," Kupers says. "And those who already suffer from a mental illness like bipolar disorder or depression will see their condition significantly exacerbated."</p>

<p>Solitary's mental health impact goes well beyond the individual. With limited visitation rights, prisoners are rarely allowed to see family and friends—quite literally their only source of connection to a world outside their own brain, which is quite literally corroding. And by the time they return home, as 95 percent of prisoners do, their depression, anger or general dysfunction affects everyone around them. They often can't stomach any human contact at all, suffering from what Kupers calls "SHU [special housing unit] syndrome."</p>

<p>Then there are the officers tasked with guarding psychologically-damaged inmates in a culture of deep violence. Bryanna Mellen, whose father was a correctional officer in Massachusetts for 22 years, described her father's mental decline over his career before he took his own life in 2011.</p>

<p>"He never wanted to talk about work," she tells me. "He wasn't in the mood to tell us about the inmate who tried to kill himself that day. Even in retirement he was increasingly paranoid and depressed." Bryanna has since founded the On Guard Initiative to raise awareness about mental health among correctional officers.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>In many ways, the psychological damage caused by solitary is infectious; too potent for steel bars, too noxious for fiberglass windows. And in this case, the infected are a social class below lepers, serving what amounts to a life sentence regardless of their crime. Casella maintains that they're "the most dehumanized members of our society." Casella also notes that the racial disparity in solitary is greater than in the general prison population.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the facts about solitary are slowly creeping into public view. The practice is now banned in most of Europe and considered torture by the United Nations. President Obama went as far as outlawing it among juveniles. US prisons are also beginning to heed the imperative to change.</p>

<p>Several state correctional departments have instituted "step-down" programs to ease inmates out of solitary, into the general prison population, and eventually back into society. States like Colorado and New York are leading the way with new policies supported by mental health research, and individual prisons, like Algers Correctional Facility in Michigan, are testing out incentives programs rooted in perks for good behavior as opposed to punitive measures for (justifiably) bad behavior. Kupers recommends "intermediate" rehabilitation approaches—halfway houses of sorts that focus on "skill-building for managing mental health</p>

<p>There may be no one-size-fits-all solution for the mental health epidemic currently plaguing solitary inmates and those who love or guard them, but a six-by-nine-foot cell is a size that fits no one, certainly not for years on end. Whether our criminal justice system is centered on fairness, safety, rehabilitation, punishment, or some other goal, solitary confinement yields the opposite, fostering injustice, violence, mental and physical atrophy, and a lifetime of pain for anyone who interacts with it. The public's health depends on changing it. Or at least that's what the facts say.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Update 1/4/17: A previous version of this story quoted Jean Cassella as saying solitary "was initially used as a control measure, with some lip service paid to rehabilitation. But eventually the practice became less about removing a criminal from society and rehabilitating him, and more about active punishment." on 1/4/17</p>

<h2 id="howsolitaryconfinementhauntsmefiveyearsaftermyrelease">How Solitary Confinement Haunts Me, Five Years After My Release</h2>

<p>by: Keri Blakinger</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-19</p>

<p>url: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xdj7z/how-solitary-confinement-haunts-me-five-years-after-my-release </p>

<p>After getting busted for heroin, I spent a brief amount of time in solitary confinement. It changed my life forever.</p>

<p>Keri Blakinger</p>

<p>Apr 19 2018, 4:22pm</p>

<p>As soon as I walked in the room, I burst out crying.</p>

<p>The place was shockingly white—neon white. And so small. There was no clock, and no books besides a Bible. The window was too high to see out of. And it was freezing.</p>

<p>Before my first stay in solitary confinement, I didn't think "the hole" sounded all that bad. I like spending time alone—I thought I'd just read quietly and maybe even enjoy the break from human interaction. But I quickly found out that solitary confinement felt a lot less like spending time alone and a lot more like being buried alive in a bright, white hell.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>When I walked out of isolation less than a week later, it felt like I'd been there at least a month. With every step I took away from the cell, I was flooded with relief. I thought the mental agony was over. In some ways, though, it was just beginning.</p>

<p>I landed behind bars in 2010. After nine years battling a drug addiction that began in the depths of depression, I was arrested during my senior year of college with a large amount of heroin. I'd been shooting up daily and selling to support my habit—and generally doing all sorts of things I would come to regret.</p>

<p>During my 21 months in the system, I only ended up in solitary confinement twice, and just for a few days each time. The first time was non-punitive: There just wasn't enough space in my "home" jail, so I got shipped off to another one, where I was put in routine isolation for a few days before being cleared to mingle with the general population. The second time was punitive, the result of what seemed to me like a combination of a dubious accusation and paperwork error.</p>

<p>Both times, I had no idea how long I'd be there. I remember wondering: Will I actually get out? Will they forget about me in here? Meanwhile, I cried. I talked to myself. I banged my head against the wall.</p>

<p>Once, I poured milk on my head just to check that I could still feel things, that I was still alive.</p>

<p>Then I contemplated whether I still wanted to be alive—and whether I could figure out a way to kill myself. Was the corner of that desk sharp enough if I fell on it at the right angle? Could I shove a noose through the vent?</p>

<p>The second stay I handled a little better than the first. But they were both some of the worst days of my life. And after all the highly questionable to downright awful things I did during nine years of addiction, that's really saying something.</p>

<p>When I finally got out of solitary—after what seemed like an eternity—I quickly realized it wasn't really over.</p>

<p>At first, I was just shaky and nervous, afraid of offending the jail gods and landing back in the hole. Eventually, whenever there were new inmates and a chance of getting boarded out and put in solitary, I would pack up all my stuff, ready to go, and then rock back-and-forth, waiting anxiously. I developed rituals to ward off fear of isolation. And eventually, I went to the jail mental health staff about the possibility of anti-anxiety medication.</p>

<p>But at that point, I was still locked up. I assumed that as I moved to the exits of the criminal justice system, things would be better. Instead, I starting having dreams about solitary confinement. Sometimes, I woke up screaming.</p>

<p>Eventually, the nightmares faded, even if the anxiety lingered. It follows me still, though—all day, every day. And sometimes I feel like I left part of me in that cell, the part of me that remembered how to worry and obsess just a little bit less.</p>

<p>Mine is not an entirely abnormal reaction, according to Terry Kupers, the Wright Institute professor and psychiatrist who penned the upcoming book Solitary: The Inside Story of Supermax Isolation and How We Can Abolish It. After exposure to solitary, high anxiety is "one of the most common symptoms," he told me. But the other effects vary from one person to the next.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>"It's a little like PTSD," Kupers said. "A lot of people go to war and have traumatic experiences, but only some develop the symptoms of PTSD.</p>

<p>"I would say maybe a quarter of the people have full-blown isolation panic," he continued, referencing a term coined by his colleague, Hans Toch, to describe immediate, intense reactions to solitary.</p>

<p>According to Kupers, other symptoms include anxiety, disordered thinking, difficulty with memory, concentration problems, sleep issues, and anger.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some folks in the criminal justice system still don't seem that bothered by solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Check out James Burns's solitary confinement project.</p>

<p>Regina Hufnagel, a former federal corrections officer who now works with the drug-policy-reform group Law Enforcement Action Partnership, only remembers seeing one inmate in nine years who really "freaked out" in solitary confinement.</p>

<p>"One day he said to me that his pink frilly dust ruffle was doing something," she recalled. Of course, his cell bed didn't have a dust ruffle—and if there was one, it certainly wouldn't have been frilly or pink.</p>

<p>But part of why Hufnagel does not seem to have witnessed a slew of negative effects from solitary confinement may stem from the fact that the facility she worked at "didn't use it that often," she conceded.</p>

<p>"I think there is an overall recognition that putting someone in the hole has detrimental effects," Hufnagel told me, stressing that she still feels it could have value as a disciplinary tool when used appropriately.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Right now, in the United States, at least 65,000 people are in solitary confinement on any given day. But the details of what that means can vary considerably from one facility to the next. VICE recently wrapped up a solitary confinement project where James Burns, a filmmaker who spent time in and out of the criminal justice system as a young man, voluntarily entered into a month of isolation at La Paz County Jail in Arizona. VICE rigged up cameras inside the cell to document it all.</p>

<p>But as harrowing as Burns's ordeal might have seemed to an onlooker, solitary confinement can be even worse. Sometimes, the cells are even more barren. Sometimes, there are no books or paper on hand. Sometimes, solitary lasts for years, rather than days or weeks.</p>

<p>That's not to say Burns somehow had it easy. If he's anything like me, no number of jailhouse privileges or amenities would make that kind of isolation a walk in the park.</p>

<p>And even if they did, it's just the start. There's still life on the outside to deal with.</p>

<p>As negotiations over immigration policy continue, it's not clear how a deal is going to come together.</p>

<p>Mark Hay</p>

<p>Put simply, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not been a reliable dealmaker in recent months. Toward the end of 2017, he promised fellow Republican Senators Susan Collins and Jeff Flake a vote on bills that would stabilize the Affordable Care Act’s individual insurance markets and grant protections for Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who came to America as children and whose protected status President Donald Trump put into jeopardy last September. Neither promise has come to fruition, nor do they seem likely to.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Yet on Monday, most Senate Democrats backed a deal to reopen the federal government after a three-day shutdown based on a McConnell promise to open debate on legislation that would protect Dreamers if the government stays open past the next funding deadline on February 8 and no earlier deal materializes. Democrats balked at this offer on Sunday, then accepted it a day layer, and have since seemingly decoupled Dreamer and funding negotiations .</p>

<p>Read: Mitch McConnell Is the Void Where the Senate's Brain Should Be </p>

<p>This about-face decision to apparently trust McConnell has enraged liberal Democrats, sewing the deepest divisions in the Democratic congressional caucus since the 2016 elections. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer “has gotten so much blowback,” said legislative behavior expert Adam Ramey, “I wouldn’t be surprised if this leads to internal debate over his continued leadership.” So why did Democrats seemingly decide to trust in McConnell, despite his unreliable reputation?</p>

<p>One school of thought argues that Democratic leaders don’t actually trust him. They just needed an excuse to end a shutdown that, as legislative affairs expert Capri Cafaro put it, “did not end up being a strong negotiating tool.”</p>

<p>Democrats reportedly walked into the shutdown hoping they could get Trump to protect Dreamers in exchange for a few concessions, mainly border wall funding. But, as Cafaro pointed out, over the past couple of weeks Trump and the Republicans seemingly hardened their conservative stances on immigration. As the shutdown stretched on, Democratic leaders realized Republican messaging painting them as holding the government hostage for “illegal immigrants” could hurt their already vulnerable Senate electoral map this fall and might even sour chunks of the public on the Dreamers.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>In this view, Democrats just had to get out of the bad spot they were in, even if it looked like a surrender to immigration activists and even if McConnell wasn’t telling the truth. If McConnell reneges on his promise, Democrats can just hit him over the head with that and use future funding bills as leverage to force another showdown if necessary. As Schumer reportedly hinted to dissenting progressive Senators after the deal passed, this may have been viewed the best of a series of bad options.</p>

<p>“This isn’t about a promise,” argued Congress watcher Joshua Huder. “It’s about leverage. Democrats have leverage. The promise is mostly fluff.”</p>

<p>Another school of thought on this deal, though, maintains that Democrats actually want to give McConnell the benefit of the doubt. He made the promise, the thinking goes, in a more public setting than his previous, broken promises. If McConnell follows through, that’s real procedural progress on an important issue. But if he reneges on this promise, after his previous failures to keep his word, it would likely lead to such a crisis of faith that, as Ramey put it, “the Senate, which has become increasingly dysfunctional, would grind to a halt.”</p>

<p>Ramey and other experts agree that McConnell is savvy enough of a politician to recognize these dynamics. Cafaro suggests that this is why he seemingly chose the wording of his promise extremely carefully, never guaranteeing more than to open up a conversation—essentially to extend more space for pre-existing negotiations.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>“I don’t think McConnell’s going to go back on his word,” said Ramey. “And I don’t think he’s being insincere. But he knows whatever comes out of this is probably going to be minimal.”</p>

<p>On Thursday, details of the White House’s preferred compromise on immigration leaked out: In exchange for giving 1.8 million Dreamers a pathway to citizenship, Trump would want Democrats to agree to give him $25 billion for his border wall and other security projects and also slash legal immigration levels. That isn’t likely to draw much Democratic support, so chances are this won’t be the framework that makes it onto the Senate floor in February.</p>

<p>It’s not clear what sort of bill, if any, could make it to the Senate floor if McConnell keeps his promise. And even if the Senate came to a bipartisan deal on immigration, conservative hardliners in the House could kill it if they thought it was too generous, as they did with a moderate Senate immigration deal in 2013. House Republican leaders have already taken pains to make it clear they won’t feel bound to run with any legislation that stems from McConnell’s promise. And no bill can become law without Trump (and his cadre of anti-immigration aides) signing off on it.</p>

<p>“In short, McConnell’s promise is nearly irrelevant to… the odds of a deal,” said Huder. “Whether he is trustworthy or not is irrelevant.”</p>

<p>McConnell’s inability to control the House or Trump may be why, in the past, he has not made good on other promises. “Nobody wants to pursue a situation that ends up as a losing battle and causes greater acrimony, particularly amongst those in their own party,” explained Cafaro.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>But McConnell might work to pass a bill this time anyway. “There may be a desire on behalf of the Senate leadership to pass the buck” when it comes to Dreamer protection legislation, said Cafaro, “by putting a bill on the floor, knowing that it will fail or die on the vine in the House, where both Democrats and Republicans have more pure, ideological views on immigration than their Senate colleagues.”</p>

<p>All told, there’s a good chance McConnell will come through on his promise—mostly because it’s not a promise to do anything other than allow debate and a vote on a bill of as-yet unclear substance that will likely get blocked by the House or Trump. Meanwhile, Democrats stand to lose face with their liberal base this November if Dreamer legislation stalls out again down the line despite their shutdown negotiation concessions for this promise.</p>

<p>Ultimately, this deal is not a referendum on McConnell’s trustworthiness. although it does stand to help his reputation on that front if he makes good on his promise. It’s more a reflection, regardless of the trust equation, of the tough spot Democrats found themselves in during the shutdown, McConnell’s strategic acumen, and the nihilistic and absurd state of congressional politics. When it comes to Dreamers’ fates and the shape of border security and immigration policy in America, none of this positioning really matters.</p>

<p>The magazine reportedly digitally scrubbed the actor in a last-minute change before publication.</p>

<p>James Franco was supposed to appear on the cover of Vanity Fair's new 2018 Hollywood Issue, but the magazine reportedly scrubbed him off in the wake of the actor's sexual misconduct allegations.</p>

<p>Sources at Vanity Fair told the Hollywood Reporter that Franco was originally one of about a dozen film and TV stars interviewed and photographed by Annie Leibovitz for the magazine's annual Hollywood Issue. But after five women came forward with accusations against the actor, Vanity Fair decided to digitally delete Franco's image before going to press.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>"We made a decision not to include James Franco on the Hollywood cover once we learned of the misconduct allegations against him," the magazine confirmed to the Reporter.</p>

<p>This year's Hollywood Issue cover features Oprah, Nicole Kidman, Tom Hanks, and Gal Godot, among others. "The films and TV shows represented by the actors in this year’s Hollywood Portfolio... took the #MeToo movement in stride, offering strong women in leading roles, as well as strong men supporting them," Vanity Fair wrote in an announcement this week.</p>

<p>The Hollywood Reporter notes that the stars featured on Vanity Fair's annual Hollywood covers are normally shot individually or in small groups and later pieced together into a complete image, hence the existence of Oprah's third hand. Because of this, the magazine's choice to remove Franco didn't require any last-minute, All the Money in the World-style reshoots—but a change to the cover design right before publication is still rare.</p>

<p>Allegations that Franco exploited and treated some of his acting students inappropriately during scenes followed his Golden Globe win for The Disaster Artist. Although he's denied the accusations, calling them "not accurate" in a Late Show interview, he's kept a low public profile since the LA Times report dropped. A source recently told PEOPLE that he's allegedly "in a bad place" and "just hiding out," and E! News reported that the actor was "somewhat relieved" he didn't receive an Oscar nomination for the film.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Franco has not responded to the Hollywood Reporter's request for comment.</p>

<p>A new poll found that 70 percent of American voters oppose a federal crackdown on states that have legalized marijuana.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions rang in the new year by rescinding the Cole memo, an Obama-era policy that protected people in states with legal weed from federal prosecution. Now, a new Quinnipiac University poll suggests that voters aren't onboard with that move.</p>

<p>While 58 percent of voters support the legalization of marijuana, a whopping 70 percent oppose having the government enforce federal marijuana laws on states that have legalized the drug.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>"The demographics say pot is here to stay, either for fun or to provide medical comfort," Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said. "And the message to Attorney General Jeff Sessions: Hands off."</p>

<p>Even some Republican lawmakers support the Cole memo. In a press release, Alaska senator Dan Sullivan said rescinding the memo "could be the impetus necessary for Congress to find a permanent legislative solution for states that have chosen to regulate the production, sale, and use of marijuana."</p>

<p>States don't seem to be taking Sessions that seriously, either. After the announcement, both New Hampshire and Vermont made moves toward legalization, following California welcoming legal recreational weed to the state on January 1.</p>

<p>Even residents in Jeff Sessions's home state support legal weed for recreational and medical uses. A survey from the group Consumer Research Around Cannabis found that 63.8 percent of voters in Birmingham supported the move—including 55 percent of self-identifying "conservatives."</p>

<p>A new report from the Washington Post confirms something we already know about Trump—he is an asshole. From the Post:</p>

<p>President Trump grew frustrated with lawmakers Thursday in the Oval Office when they floated restoring protections for immigrants from Haiti, El Salvador and African countries as part of a bipartisan immigration deal, according to two people briefed on the meeting.</p>

<p>“Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” Trump said, according to these people, referring to African countries and Haiti. He then suggested that the United States should instead bring more people from countries like Norway, whose prime minister he met Wednesday.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>White House spokesman Raj Shah did not deny that Trump said this. Instead, he pivoted to talking about how great the president was. “Certain Washington politicians choose to fight for foreign countries, but President Trump will always fight for the American people,” Shah said in a statement.</p>

<p>Trump was immediately condemned all over social media and cable news for his "shithole" remark, of course, but we already knew what the president has in his head. This is a guy who started his presidential campaign calling Mexican "rapists," implied a judge was treating him "unfairly" because the judge "is of Mexican heritage," and rose to fame in the political world by leading the racist birther movement against Barack Obama. This is a man who has insisted that the Central Park Five—a group of black and Latino teenagers wrongfully convicted of raping a woman in 1989—were guilty, even though DNA evidence exonerated them. Going further back, his real estate company was accused of racist practices decades ago.</p>

<p>It's not like the White House is changing Trump. Three weeks ago, the New York Times reported that the president said that Haitian immigrants “all have AIDS” in the same meeting where he supposedly said that Nigerians live in "huts." The "shithole" remark might have shocked people, but it didn't surprise anyone who has been paying attention.</p>

<p>I don't know what else to say—just, Christ, Trump is an asshole.</p>

<p>Jeff Sessions just unleashed federal prosecutors despite a massive amount of evidence that weed is associated with fewer fatal overdoses. </p>

<p>With America still deep in the throes of its deadliest-ever drug epidemic, you might expect the most powerful people in the country to be ready to try anything supported by evidence to stop the bleeding. Instead, on Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions opened a new front in the War on Weed, rescinding Obama-era policies that discouraged federal prosecution of pot crimes in legal-weed states. Given that study after study suggests marijuana availability is linked to lower overdose death rates, reduced use of opioids for chronic pain, and lower rates of opioid addiction, a stranger, more ill-advised policy is hard to imagine.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Though some US attorneys have said that they will not change their priorities in response— and there has been a huge political backlash—the threat of a crackdown will inevitably have a chilling effect on the nascent pot industry. While Congress still prohibits federal money being spent to interfere with medical weed in the states that have it, that provision expires on January 19, and may not be included in the next budget.</p>

<p>To understand just how counterproductive it would be to legally target weed right now, it’s worth looking closely at the growing body of data suggesting that pot may be preventing he opioid epidemic from being even deadlier. At least 11 studies have analyzed the effects of marijuana on opioid use for chronic pain, as well as its connections with opioid-overdose deaths and addiction rates. Ten of them found strong positive associations, meaning that more marijuana availability was associated with less harm from opioids.</p>

<p>For example, research published in JAMA Internal Medicine in 2014 analyzed the relationship between a state’s legalization of medical marijuana and its opioid overdose death rate, using data from 1999 through 2010 in all 50 states. It found that overall, medical cannabis legalization was associated with a 25 percent reduction in overdose deaths— and that the longer the laws were in effect, the greater the decline. Indeed, states that had such laws for six years saw a 33 percent reduction in fatalities.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>“The fact that we are seeing decline of fatal overdose by 25 percent in states with legal medical marijuana, although it doesn’t show causation, it certainly shows a correlation that all of us need to stand up and take notice of,” said Dr. David Nathan, a distinguished psychiatrist and founder of Doctors for Cannabis Regulation, “It’s quite intuitive that cannabis, both as an adjunct to and replacement for opioids, would lead to a favorable outcome given that cannabis is much less toxic."</p>

<p>Another study, conducted by researchers at the nonpartisan Rand Corporation and published as a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research in 2015, found that medical marijuana availability was linked with reductions in both the opioid overdose death rate and the rate at which people sought treatment for opioid addiction. In states that had the greatest access to medical marijuana via dispensaries, treatment admissions related to opioids were reduced by 28 percent—while overdose death rates fell by 31 percent. Like the JAMA Internal Medicine study, this research also showed that the effect became larger over time.</p>

<p>A third study published in the American Journal of Public Health looked specifically at Colorado and found that its legalization of recreational marijuana sales in 2012 (it legalized medical marijuana in 2000, but did not have dispensaries until 2007) was connected with a 6.5 percent reduction in opioid related deaths. Another study in the same journal found that the percentage of drivers involved in car crashes with opioids in their systems declined among drivers between 21 and 40 in medical marijuana states.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Weed seems to substitute for opioids both when it comes to treating chronic pain and providing an alternative means of recreation for some who misuse painkillers. And while no one sane believes pot is a panacea that can completely replace opioids for pain or eliminate the need for maintenance medications in addiction treatment, there’s even more evidence that it can help reduce harm.</p>

<p>For example, 2016 study of the Medicare population published in Health Affairs found that having an effective medical marijuana law in place reduced the number of prescription pain relievers prescribed per doctor by just over 1,800 daily doses per year, compared to states without such laws. Reductions were also seen in prescribing of antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, leading to an estimated $165 million in savings in 2013. A follow-up study last year suggested Medicare could save over $1 billion if all states made medical marijuana legally available.</p>

<p>Several research groups also interviewed chronic pain patients and medical marijuana users about which drugs they used medical marijuana to replace or reduce. One study surveyed nearly 3,000 pot smokers recruited at Washington dispensaries or via social media: 36 percent said they used marijuana to replace opioids; a Canadian study had similar findings.</p>

<p>Other researchers compared chronic pain patients who either did or did not access medical marijuana in New Mexico: the medical marijuana users were 17 times more likely to stop using prescription opioids, five times more likely to reduce their daily dose of opioids, and took opioid doses that declined by nearly half over the 21 month study period; those who didn’t use medical marijuana showed a slight rise in opioid dose. A study of 244 Michigan medical marijuana patients found a 64 percent decrease in opioid use following initiation of medical marijuana.</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>The only study I could find suggesting potential opioid-related harm linked to marijuana availability concluded that medical marijuana laws were associated with a rise in opioid mortality—but only if a state did not also have a prescription-drug monitoring database. Since all 50 states (Missouri had been the exception) have or will have such systems, it is not clear how relevant this kind of outlier is.</p>

<p>I’ve reviewed here only how marijuana access is linked with reductions in opioid-associated damage: I do not have space to examine the studies on how it has also been linked with reductions in traffic deaths and those that suggest people often use marijuana instead of alcohol, which is a much riskier drug in terms of violence (including sexual assaults). But they also lean in the same positive direction, as does data showing that legal recreational weed is not associated with rising teen use.</p>

<p>Basically, going after marijuana during an overdose epidemic arguably amounts to one of the dumbest federal government policies in American history. Not only will cutting the pot supply (if that is even achievable—decades of the War on Drugs suggest otherwise) be likely to drive more, rather than fewer, people towards opioids, but any money spent on doing so cannot be used to fund proven life-saving treatments, like long-term methadone and buprenorphine, which can cut the overdose death rate in half.</p>

<p>Read: It's Time for Democrats to Go All in on Weed </p>

<p>Many experts, like Mark Kleiman, professor of public policy at the Marron Institute at New York University, suspect Sessions will not follow through with major new pot enforcement. “What's notable about the Sessions statement is what it doesn't say,” Kleiman told me. “It doesn't mention injunctions. And it doesn't mention using the Narcotic Section of the Criminal Division to prosecute some cases. Looks to me like a bluff—or mostly a bluff. Maybe they'll make a few examples.”</p>

<p>While that might strike fear into investors and people who work in the marijuana business, it’s unlikely to have any long-term impact on the drug policy debate in the country. “This move represents a broken campaign promise by the president,” Tom Angell, author of the indispensable marijuana newsletter and website, Marijuana Moment, told me. “With polls showing that marijuana legalization is way more popular than the president is, this will likely turn out to be a huge political disaster for the administration, as is shown by the crushing bipartisan blowback we're now seeing in Congress. Either way, it's not going to stop even more states from modernizing their cannabis laws.”</p>

<p>Advertisement</p>

<p>Sessions’s move could, however, add at least a temporary roadblock for people seeking a promising alternative treatment for pain and opioid addiction. With nearly 100 people dying from opioid-related overdoses every single day, this is inexcusable.</p>
