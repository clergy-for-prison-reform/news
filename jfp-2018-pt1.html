<h2 id="judgeseparatedfamiliesmustbereunitedwithin30days">Judge: Separated Families Must be Reunited Within 30 Days</h2>

<p>by: The Associated Press</p>

<p>MCALLEN, Texas (AP) — A judge in California on Tuesday ordered U.S. border authorities to reunite separated families within 30 days, setting a hard deadline in a process that has so far yielded uncertainty about when children might again see their parents.</p>

<p>If children are younger than 5, they must be reunified within 14 days of the order issued Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw in San Diego. Sabraw, an appointee of President George W. Bush, also issued a nationwide injunction on future family separations, unless the parent is deemed unfit or doesn't want to be with the child. He also requires the government provide phone contact between parents and their children within 10 days.</p>

<p>More than 2,000 children have been separated from their parents in recent weeks and placed in government-contracted shelters — hundreds of miles away, in some cases — under a now-abandoned policy toward families caught illegally entering the U.S.</p>

<p>Amid an international outcry, Trump last week issued an executive order to stop the separation of families and said parents and children will instead be detained together. A Department of Homeland Security statement over the weekend on reuniting families only seemed to sow more confusion.</p>

<p>"The facts set forth before the Court portray reactive governance_responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the Government's own making," Sabraw wrote. "They belie measured and ordered governance, which is central to the concept of due process enshrined in our Constitution."</p>

<p>The ruling was a win for the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit in March involving a 7-year-old girl who was separated from her Congolese mother and a 14-year-old boy who was separated from his Brazilian mother.</p>

<p>"Tears will be flowing in detention centers across the country when the families learn they will be reunited," said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt.</p>

<p>The Justice and Homeland Security Departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment late Tuesday.</p>

<p>It's not clear how border authorities will meet the deadline. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Congress on Tuesday that his department still has custody of 2,047 immigrant children separated from their parents at the border. That is only six fewer children than the number in HHS custody as of last Wednesday. Democratic senators said that wasn't nearly enough progress.</p>

<p>Under questioning, Azar refused to be pinned down on how long it will take to reunite families. He said his department does extensive vetting of parents to make sure they are not traffickers masquerading as parents.</p>

<p>Also challenging will be the requirement the judge set on phone contact.</p>

<p>At a Texas detention facility, immigrant advocates complained that parents have gotten busy signals or no answers from a 1-800 number provided by federal authorities to get information about their children.</p>

<p>Attorneys have spoken to about 200 immigrants at the Port Isabel detention facility near Los Fresnos, Texas, since last week, and only a few knew where their children were being held, said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg of the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia.</p>

<p>"The U.S. government never had any plan to reunite these families that were separated," Sandoval-Moshenberg said, and now it is "scrambling to undo this terrible thing that they have done."</p>

<p>A message left for HHS, which runs the hotline, was not immediately returned.</p>

<p>Many children in shelters in southern Texas have not had contact with their parents, though some have reported being allowed to speak with them in recent days, said Meghan Johnson Perez, director of the Children's Project for the South Texas Pro Bono Asylum Representation Project, which provides free legal services to minors.</p>

<p>"Things might be changing now. The agencies are trying to coordinate better," she said. "But the kids we have been seeing have not been in contact with the parents. They don't know where the parent is. They're just distraught. Their urgent need is just trying to figure out, 'Where is my parent?'"</p>

<p>The decision comes as 17 states, including New York and California, sued the Trump administration Tuesday to force it to reunite children and parents. The states, all led by Democratic attorneys general, joined Washington, D.C., in filing the lawsuit in federal court in Seattle, arguing that they are being forced to shoulder increased child welfare, education and social services costs. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the multistate lawsuit.</p>

<p>"The administration's practice of separating families is cruel, plain and simple," New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said in a statement. "Every day, it seems like the administration is issuing new, contradictory policies and relying on new, contradictory justifications. But we can't forget: The lives of real people hang in the balance."</p>

<p>In a speech before the conservative Criminal Justice Legal Foundation in Los Angeles, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the administration for taking a hardline stand on illegal immigration and said the voters elected President Donald Trump to do just that.</p>

<p>"This is the Trump era," he said. "We are enforcing our laws again. We know whose side we are on — so does this group — and we're on the side of police, and we're on the side of the public safety of the American people."</p>

<p>After expressing reluctance in May to get too deeply involved in immigration enforcement decisions, the judge who issued Tuesday's ruling was clearly influenced by Trump's reversal last week and the Homeland Security Department's statement on its family reunification plan Saturday night, which, he said, left many questions unanswered.</p>

<p>"This situation has reached a crisis level. The news media is saturated with stories of immigrant families being separated at the border. People are protesting. Elected officials are weighing in. Congress is threatening action," he wrote.</p>

<p>Outraged by the family separations, immigrant supporters have led protests in recent days in states such as Florida and Texas. In Los Angeles, police arrested 25 demonstrators at rally Tuesday ahead of Sessions' address.</p>

<p>Outside the U.S. attorney's office, protesters carried signs reading, "Free the children!" and "Stop caging families." Clergy members blocked the street by forming a human chain. Police handcuffed them and led them away.</p>

<p>Later, protesters gathered outside the hotel where Sessions gave his speech. As the attorney general's motorcade arrived, the crowd chanted, "Nazi, go home."</p>

<h2 id="dasmithonpoliceshootingsbeingavictim">DA Smith on Police Shootings, Being a Victim</h2>

<p>by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p>url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/27/da-smith-police-shootings-being-victim/ </p>

<p>On June 18, 2018, Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith spoke to Jackson’s officer-ID task force about how officer-involved shooting cases go through the system. He is pictured here during one of his trials. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — For the better part of last week's officer-identification task-force meeting at the Jackson Municipal Art Gallery, some of the members didn't know they had a prominent guest.</p>

<p>In its sixth meeting since April without any recommendation, the group carried on its usual banter and monologues about policing, which some members would agree are getting a bit repetitive. It wasn't until the task force's co-chair, attorney CJ Lawrence, mentioned that he wanted to ask the district attorney how many officers his office has indicted that everyone realized that Robert Shuler Smith was in the room.</p>

<p>"Is he here?" Paul Hobson, a Jackson Police Department detective, asked as he looked around the room.</p>

<p>The Hinds County district attorney sat quietly at the end of an L-shaped meeting table inside the City's art gallery—a former stately home tucked behind tall trees and flora that line the garden entryway. Smith sipped from a 20-ounce plastic bottle of Coca-Cola and plucked potato chips carefully without rustling the bag.</p>

<p>After his snack, he scribbled notes randomly with a No. 2 yellow pencil.</p>

<p>Jackson's officer-ID task force invited the district attorney of Mississippi's largest county to speak to them about how officer-involved shootings go through the local criminal-justice system.</p>

<p>Smith's public appearances in the last two years have mainly been in circuit courts as he battled charges that range from hindering prosecution to domestic violence. His Rankin County domestic-violence trial will resume in the fall, after nearly a year of court-ordered delay.</p>

<p>Hinds County DA Robert Shuler Smith's domestic violence trial, which was scheduled for this Monday, has been continued by order of the Court until September 10, 2018. </p>

<p>Translation: you have plenty of time to read up on past @JxnFreePress coverage of him: https://t.co/4mJXVqry78 pic.twitter.com/e5zFdYzDne</p>

<p>— ko “that’s it” bragg. (@keaux_) March 16, 2018</p>

<p>At the June 18 meeting, however, Smith spoke about laws he enforces instead of laws he had been accused of violating. The DA demonstrated that he, in theory, supports progressive measures and national trends on transparency around officer-involved shootings, but, to date, he has not wielded his power as district attorney to make them a reality in Hinds County.</p>

<p>'The Families Deserve Answers'</p>

<p>DA Smith spoke in a cool and collected manner as he divulged as much information as he could about the grand-jury system and even spoke vaguely about cases currently under investigation in his office.</p>

<p>Smith said he did not recall an officer in Hinds County ever being indicted for an officer-involved shooting in his ten-year tenure as district attorney. In April, at least four JPD officers were "no-billed" in three deadly officer-involved shootings spanning from November to February, meaning that those cases will not go to trial unless the district attorney's office decides to investigate further.</p>

<p>Before a grand jury convenes, the district attorney's office receives a case file. Smith said the first thing he and his attorneys do is look at the investigating agency and determine whether or not there has been a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>"We prefer for an outside agency besides JPD to investigate these cases," the district attorney said. "We have a few cases that we're reviewing at this time because the families deserve answers."</p>

<p>Smith spoke of one current case in which his office realized that no one had interviewed a number of witnesses to an officer-involved shooting. He said that case would have to go back to the grand jury because families often hire private attorneys who can gather evidence before the district attorney's office gets to it, posing a problem if they do not cover all the bases in the investigative process.</p>

<p>"But (the investigation) certainly has to be very thorough because, again, we've seen some surprise press conferences where the families are standing outside and complaining, and that's something that we need to address before it continues," Smith said.</p>

<p>Notably, Baltimore-based attorney Jason Downs and the family of 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes held an impromptu press conference on the lawn outside Jackson City Hall in May to reveal that Downs' investigation had found details inconsistent with JPD's internal investigation into the traffic stop that resulted in two officers fatally shooting Barnes.</p>

<p>Downs also released the names of JPD Officers Rakasha Adams and Albert Taylor, believed to have killed Barnes. Their names are on the April no-bill list, with Adams appearing a second time for a separate deadly on-the-job-shooting in November 2017.</p>

<p>A DA's Immense Powers</p>

<p>Downs ultimately filed a petition against the City of Jackson to divulge information in Barnes', case, putting the onus on city officials and police chiefs to be transparent, as is the national trend.</p>

<p>District attorneys have immense powers to change and reform the criminal-justice system. At the meeting, Smith was under the impression that the purpose of the task force was to decide policy that would make everyone at the table, including him, comfortable, and he seemed willing to go along with whatever the end recommendations shall be.</p>

<p>"If there's going to be a policy, then there's going to be a policy. If you all agree that it's going to be 72 hours, then it's 72 hours," Smith said, noncommittally.</p>

<p>To have Smith's support in releasing names should Jackson follow the lead of many other U.S. cities would be the Crisco that eased the system along. But, he has the legal power to do much more than that, like progressive district attorneys nationwide.</p>

<p>Larry Krasner, the district attorney in Philadelphia, Pa., since November 2017, spent three decades suing police for civil-rights violations more than 75 times before be became the district attorney. He wanted to fix the system from the outside.</p>

<p>"I have—like a lot of civil-rights lawyers, like a lot of activists—been beating my head against the wall of the DA's office and the (Philadelphia) police department for a long time because the DA's office in Philly was not enforcing the law against police. Somebody had to do it," he told Business Insider.</p>

<p>Philadelphia is a distinctive place for a progressive district attorney, because he has the power to make a huge difference in a city with a staggering incarceration rate and the highest poverty rate for a big city in the U.S.</p>

<p>The DOJ's assessment of deadly force in the Philadelphia Police Department led to the best-practices recommendation to release names in 72 hours following an officer-involved shooting.</p>

<p>Krasner didn't just run on rhetoric, either. Earlier this month, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Krasner's office "asked the city's Police Department for nearly a decade's accounting of serious violations by its officers so it can compile a comprehensive roster of those who have lied while on duty, used excessive force, racially profiled, or violated civil rights."</p>

<p>The goal is to have more transparency around officers who appear as witnesses, although Krasner has not yet decided if the list would become public.</p>

<p>Transformation is happening in the South too. Kim Ogg, the district attorney of Harris County, Texas—which includes Houston—decriminalized small possessions of marijuana, which diverted 576 people from jail in the first six weeks following her decision and saved the county more than $1.5 million, she told the Texas Observer. She diverts them to drug-education programs instead.</p>

<p>Aramis Ayala, the state's attorney in a district near Orlando, Fla., and the first black state attorney in Florida history, decided not to use the death penalty in her district, despite pressure to implement it in high-profile cases or police killings.</p>

<p>These district and state's attorneys are among a growing class of reformers using their power as the highest prosecutors in their respective areas to enact change.</p>

<p>Many of them unseated longstanding conservative attorneys, including one in the state of Mississippi. Scott Colom, the district attorney in the 16th district that includes Noxubee, Clay, Oktibbeha and Lowndes Counties, defeated Forrest Allgood who had held the position since 1989. The Washington Post coined Allgood as "one of America's worst prosecutors."</p>

<p>Colom ran on the platform that tough-on-crime policies, such as Allgood's, don't work. In 2015 he told Slate that district attorneys should exercise more discretion when it comes to non-violent drug offenders and young people in the system.</p>

<p>During Colom's campaign for district attorney, he tried to inform people of the role's powers, and was "shocked" to find how few people know what DAs actually do. He sought messaging that would stick.</p>

<p>"What really, really resonates with people is when you say, 'We're sending too many young people to jail.' A lot of people agree with that statement. They don't have to understand what the district attorney does," Colom said.</p>

<p>Smith the 'Victim'</p>

<p>DA Smith left the task-force meeting to take a call after his cell phone chimed to the Firefly ringtone on AT&amp;T phones—watch any of the company's commercials, and you'd be familiar with the sound.</p>

<p>An hour into questions from journalists and task-force members, Smith posed a question himself—he wanted to know what Adofo Minka, a criminal-defense attorney who often attends the meetings and writes occasional opinion columns for the Jackson Free Press, thought about the policy of releasing names within 72 hours.</p>

<p>Minka believes the names should be released immediately and that police officers should get the same treatment as any other citizen who discharges a weapon.</p>

<p>"What's good for the goose is good for the gander is my position," Minka said.</p>

<p>While Smith has not proved to be a progressive leader in his role as district attorney, he knows what it is like to be on the other side of a grand jury indictment and to have a mugshot publicly circulated like many arrestees in the Jackson metro area.</p>

<p>Ironically, however, Smith's defense in cases where the State of Mississippi accused him of tampering with prosecutions was that he was trying to protect an innocent man. But Smith did not go through an obviously legal procedure to help Christopher Butler, later convicted of wire fraud and drug trafficking in separate cases.</p>

<p>Instead, Smith shouted at judges and claimed the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics tampered with video surveillance that his office never fully reviewed. A second jury believed Smith, after his first trial ended with a hung jury, and ultimately, a mistrial.</p>

<p>Smith continued to listen as Minka detailed his issues with grand juries.</p>

<p>"These are institutions of secrecy and deception sometimes, so we hold these institutions up like they're some kind of holy grail, but if we look at them from a historical standpoint, they have degraded people...," Minka said.</p>

<p>"I've been a victim of that," the Hinds County district attorney replied.</p>

<h2 id="publishersnotetimestheyareachanginatthejfp">PUBLISHER'S NOTE: Times They Are a Changin’ at the JFP</h2>

<p>by: Todd Stauffer</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p>url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/jun/27/publishers-note-times-they-are-changin-jfp/ </p>

<p>JFP Magazine will focus on great storytelling, such as Donna Ladd’s long-form story this issue about former gangster Benny Ivey, who toured her through South Jackson and Rankin County to explain his history of house burglaries, addiction, dealing meth and leading a white gang. Photo by</p>

<p>Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Todd Stauffer</p>

<p>Let's jump right to it—we're announcing exciting changes with this issue. We've been planning for months how we will best serve the reader, how we serve local businesses and help make Jackson the best place we can moving forward.</p>

<p>In print, we are now Jackson Free Press Magazine. Our team has re-imagined and redesigned the publication to be more pleasing to the eye, and to present tons of interesting tidbits of information, longer story-telling features and in-depth listings.</p>

<p>In fact, "feature" is the critical word. We've heard frequently from readers that your favorite JFP articles go in-depth and tell engaging stories, such as Editor-in-Chief Donna Ladd's cover story on Benny Ivey and other men working to overcome crime and addiction. For news-focused articles, that means looking for both the causes and solutions for problems facing the city and state. For arts and culture, that means focusing more on the people behind those stories, including "why" and "how."</p>

<p>We've also heard it can be tough to get through an issue of the JFP in one week, especially those dense with rich content. We've been thinking for a while about how best to position the print publication and website to serve our readers and advertisers.</p>

<p>Step one: This magazine will be published every two weeks, not weekly. Our focus in print will be narrative feature pieces—built around stories about real people—on both news-related and cultural topics. Breaking news and most opinion will move exclusively to the online Jackson Free Press, where real-time content and commentary are best consumed and discussed. Ultimately, our goal is to put out a publication that makes you want to turn your phone over, lean back in a good chair, and read a story you can't put down.</p>

<p>Step two: We're redesigning Jackson Free Press online. The new design will be mobile-first, and will give us an opportunity to present very appealing layouts and photography in story packages. We're moving our entire 15+ year archive of stories (not a simple task) while taking advantage of the new system to present stories in different, exciting ways. We hope to launch that new site in July, at which point we hope you'll bookmark it, and return over and over again! (Oh, and, yes, our team is using words "podcast" and "more video" frequently as well, so keep an eye out.)</p>

<p>I won't pretend market forces don't influence these changes—paper prices have risen dramatically this year (I'll leave the "tariff talk" for online) while, at the same time, digital advertising options have exploded. By making this move now, we feel we can offer extraordinary benefit to our readers and the advertisers who want to reach our engaged readers through a mix of print and online marketing opportunities.</p>

<p>Nielsen Scarborough reports that the Jackson Free Press has more than 97,000 cumulative ("unique") readers of our print product; in May 2018, we had more than 105,000 unique visitors to our website. So, finding ways for advertisers to reach our audience in both mediums—affordably and targeted—is helping shape our strategy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, JFP Digital Services (jfpdigitalservices.com) has grown by more than 300 percent in the past 18 months. It offers web design, content, social-media and e-mail marketing, logo design, print collateral and more for local businesses and organizations. We're particularly good at working with local service firms who need to convert web visitors into paying clients. If you want your website to generate leads and appointments for you, give us a call. (Or if you need to be a better "publisher" on the web and in social channels, that's our bread and butter. Reach me at 601-362-6121 ext. 17 or todd@jacksonfreepress.com.)</p>

<p>JFP Digital has now added programmatic and retargeting advertising services, along with search-engine marketing. If you'd like a local resource for digital advertising advice—someone knowledgeable to meet with you regularly and work with you to meet your goals—call or write!</p>

<p>Now, let me talk about who has led these changes. We recently said goodbye to Arielle Dreher, with us for three years as our state reporter. Arielle did a fantastic job with award-winning reporting and dogged, shoe-leather, document-scouring investigations. She brought a fantastic attitude to the office every day and was a delight and inspiration for her co-workers and managers. And she helped envision these new products. Watch for an exciting new state reporter to arrive in August to pick up where she left off.</p>

<p>Ko Bragg, our city reporter since just last fall, first received a Bringing Home the World fellowship from the International Center for Journalists, which is sending her to Liberia for two weeks in July to report for the JFP. She then learned that she is a Reveal investigative fellow, with a hefty stipend to do in-depth reporting for us on juveniles tried as adults. And no city coverage we've done or seen rivals her work to date.</p>

<p>The news team—Arielle, Ko and Donna—won multiple awards this spring including Best in Division (and the most in the state) from the southeastern Society of Professional Journalists.</p>

<p>Kristin Brenemen, Zilpha Young, Amber Helsel, Micah Smith and Dustin Cardon played huge roles in the print and website redesigns; Meghan Garner is juggling digital services and sales tasks, and new client website design and launches.</p>

<p>We have three amazing in-house interns this summer: Marie Weidmayer (news), Kristina Domitrovich (editing) and Z'eani Furge (video) for online and print.</p>

<p>Kimberly Griffin, associate publisher, has collaborated with advertisers about the changes. And Cassandra Acker supports the team through office management, sales assistance, and our distribution team rocks.</p>

<p>We're excited to roll into the second half of 2018 with this new look, new focus and a determination to continue producing fantastic solutions journalism and culture coverage with the goal of improving the lives of Jackson-area residents. Thanks for being such a critical part of it!</p>

<p>Senate candidate David Baria and his daughter hug soon after the Associated Press calls the primary race in his favor.</p>

<p>GULFPORT, Miss. — With his family by his side, Rep. David Baria, leader of the Mississippi House Democratic Caucus, declared victory in his bid for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate Tuesday night.</p>

<p>“We were outspent by our opponents something like four-to-one,” Baria told a crowd of around sixty supporters gathered at Murky Waters BBQ in Gulfport. “But money does not buy Mississippi, folks.”</p>

<p>Baria defeated Democratic opponent Howard Sherman by double digits in Tuesday’s runoff election, after placing a close second to Sherman in the June 11 primary. He will now face incumbent Republican Sen. Roger Wicker in the November general election.</p>

<p>Throughout his primary campaign, Baria emphasized his support for criminal-justice reform, the protections of the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid expansion, and equal pay for women.</p>

<p>Baria said he made the decision early on to run an authentic campaign as an unapologetic Democrat, not as “Republican-lite.”</p>

<p>“We decided at the beginning to run the campaign we wanted to run,” Baria said. “We didn’t want to be middle-of-the-road, trying to run away from who we are and what we stand for, so we decided to do this the way we wanted to do it.”</p>

<p>Wicker, Baria said, has been in Washington for 24 years and has millions in campaign cash at his disposal. “But I ain’t scared,” Baria said. “Because every time I’ve been involved in a campaign, I’ve been the underdog. I’ve been outspent two or three to one, and we’ve come out on top every time.”</p>

<p>While admitting that this is his first statewide race, Baria said he feels “confident” going into November. “I’m ready for this fight. I’m eager for this fight. And with you folks on my side, we’re going to win this fight in November.”</p>

<p>Not long after Baria’s win was announced, Wicker’s office released a statement congratulating Baria and adding that he “looks forward to seeing him on the campaign trail.”</p>

<p>Baria will face Wicker in the general election on Nov. 6, 2018.</p>

<p>JACKSON — With his family by his side, Rep. David Baria, leader of the Mississippi House Democratic Caucus, declared victory in his bid for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate, at Murky Waters in Gulfport, on Tuesday night after the announcement of the results of the primary run-off.</p>

<p>"We were outspent by our opponents something like four-to-one," Baria told a crowd of around 60 supporters gathered at Murky Waters BBQ in Gulfport. "But money does not buy Mississippi, folks."</p>

<p>Baria defeated Democratic opponent Howard Sherman with 58.5 percent of the votes in Tuesday's runoff election, after placing a close second to Sherman in the June 11 primary.</p>

<p>In Meridian, a smattering of Sherman supporters waited at Weidmann's Restaurant downtown as election returns ended the venture capitalist and businessman's first effort to win political office.</p>

<p>Howard Sherman (right) and his wife, acclaimed actress and Meridian native Sela Ward (left), arrived at the restaurant to accept the runoff defeat after the Associated Press called the election. The couple acknowledged sting from what they described as dirty politics.</p>

<p>Sherman and his wife, acclaimed actress and Meridian native Sela Ward, arrived at the restaurant to accept the runoff defeat after the Associated Press called the election. The couple acknowledged sting from what they described as dirty politics.</p>

<p>"It was a tough race," Sherman said. "Facts about my past were mischaracterized."</p>

<p>After defeating Sherman, Baria will face incumbent Republican Sen. Roger Wicker in the November general election.

<p>Throughout Sherman's campaign, questions persisted about his commitment to the Democratic Party. Sherman, a California native, donated cash to Republicans, including Wicker. Sherman said he supported Wicker when the Tea Party Republican Chris McDaniel planned to challenge the senator.</p>

<p>Although Sherman said he has no plans to support Wicker in the general election, the Democrat said he's not ready to make an endorsement for Baria.</p>

<p>"We're not going anywhere," he said. "This where we live; this is where we love."</p>

<p>David Baria hugs his daughter, Merritt Baria, after learning he won the run-off.</p>

<p>Looking toward November, Baria said Wicker's millions of campaign dollars and the 24 years he has spent in Washington, D.C., doesn't faze him. "But I ain't scared," Baria said. "Because every time I've been involved in a campaign, I've been the underdog. I've been outspent two or three to one, and we've come out on top every time."</p>

<p>While admitting that this is his first statewide race, Baria said he feels "confident" going into November. "I'm ready for this fight. I'm eager for this fight. And with you folks on my side, we're going to win this fight in November."</p>

<p>Not long after Baria's win was announced, Wicker's office released a statement congratulating Baria and adding that he "looks forward to seeing him on the campaign trail." Baria will face Wicker in the general election on Nov. 6, 2018.</p>

<p>In the other primary run-off, Rankin and Madison counties District Attorney Michael Guest earned the Republican nomination for the Third U.S. Congressional District. He will face Democratic nominee Michael "Ted" Evans in November. Read the article about the race here.</p>

<h2 id="federalhatecrimechargesfiledinvirginiarallydeath">Federal Hate Crime Charges Filed in Virginia Rally Death</h2>

<p>Authorities have said Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the "Unite the Right" rally Aug. 12 that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument.

<p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — The man accused of plowing a car into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a woman and injuring dozens more, now faces federal hate crime charges.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice announced that an indictment returned Wednesday charges James Alex Fields Jr., 21, of Maumee, Ohio, with 30 crimes, including one count of a hate crime resulting in the death of Heather Heyer, and 28 other hate crimes involving an attempt to kill dozens of other people who were injured. Another charge accuses him of "racially motivated violent interference" with a federally protected activity.</p>

<p>"Last summer's violence in Charlottesville cut short a promising young life and shocked the nation," U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement. "Today's indictment should send a clear message to every would-be criminal in America that we aggressively prosecute violent crimes of hate that threaten the core principles of our nation."</p>

<p>Authorities have said Fields, described by a former teacher as having a keen interest in Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler, drove his speeding car into a group of people demonstrating against the "Unite the Right" rally Aug. 12 that drew hundreds of white nationalists to the college town, where officials planned to remove a Confederate monument.</p>

<p>Fields already faces state charges including first-degree murder and is set to face a jury trial later this year. He has been in custody since the rally. The attorney representing Fields on those counts declined comment Wednesday.</p>

<p>The car attack came after the rally had descended into chaos — with violent brawling between attendees and counterdemonstrators — and authorities had forced the crowd to disband.</p>

<p>The eight-page indictment alleges Fields decided to attend the rally on or before Aug. 8. As he prepared to leave to travel to Charlottesville, a family member sent him a text message urging him to be careful, the indictment said.</p>

<p>Fields replied, "We're not the ones who need to be careful," and attached an image of Hitler, according to the indictment, which also says Fields used social media to promote racist views.</p>

<p>Fields then attended the rally Aug. 12, engaging in chants promoting white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views, the indictment said.</p>

<p>After authorities forced the crowd to disband, Fields drove his car toward the area where a "racially and ethnically diverse crowd" had gathered to protest, the indictment said.</p>

<p>"Fields rapidly accelerated, through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd," it said.</p>

<p>In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge Adam S. Lee of the Richmond Division thanked the business owners and Charlottesville residents who he said "worked with us and provided a massive volume of evidence in this case."</p>

<p>The federal civil rights case is not the first under Sessions' Justice Department, but it is certainly the most high-profile one. Critics of Sessions for the last year have been concerned about what they see as less aggressive enforcement of federal civil rights laws, and especially the Justice Department's lack of intervention against local police agencies with troubled relationships with minorities.</p>

<p>But in bringing the prosecution, Sessions appeared to assert himself as independent from President Donald Trump — who blamed the violence on both sides and was accused of emboldening racists — and suggested that the Justice Department would continue to treat racially motivated acts of violence as hate crimes.</p>

<h2 id="projectejectpreventionpiecebeginsatlocalboysandgirlsclubs">Project EJECT 'Prevention Piece' Begins at Local Boys and Girls Clubs</h2>

<p>by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>date: 2018-07-02</p>

<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Candace Mayberry delivered a presentation to middle and high schoolers at the Boys and Girls Club on Raymond Road on June 27 and had them take a pledge against gun violence. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — Fifteen minutes before the U.S. Attorney's Office's presentation on June 27 to a room of seventh through twelfth graders at the Boys and Girls Club near Forest Hill High School, kids of all ages swept the floor of the gymnasium with industrial-sized and household brooms, amassing wrappers, dust and bags of chips into a pile by the garbage can. It took an adult to actually get everything into a dustpan and ultimately the trash.</p>

<p>As the particles from the vigorous sweeping job swirled in the air, Assistant U.S. Attorney Candace Mayberry plugged in a laptop and got some kids to use blue masking tape to hang up a pledge against gun violence printed on a white banner that included the Boys and Girls Club logo. Others pulled two sets of bleachers from the wall and moved them to the middle of the room, where the teens would sit for Mayberry's presentation.</p>

<p>Mayberry is from Jackson, so she was able to color her presentation with personal and relatable anecdotes.</p>

<p>"I also used to be a defense attorney, and I represented kids that were 13, 15, 16, 19, and it's not abnormal to see that," she said. "It hurts to see someone close to my daughter's age and someone who is what I consider still a child in handcuffs, but that's our reality."</p>

<p>Mayberry leads the "prevention piece" of Project EJECT, as it is labeled in a press release. It includes various speaking engagements with young people. This is a part of the U.S. Attorney's Office's L.E.A.D. Program: Legal Enrichment and Decision Making. U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst's predecessor, Greg Davis, began the program through which he spoke to students across the state.</p>

<p>Davis and Hurst differ, however, on their approaches to violent-crime in Jackson. Davis' Jackson Violent Crime Initiative aimed to remove violent offenders from the streets and also worked in conjunction with federal partners. But Davis did not include the caveat that such people would be thrown out of their communities, as is the fundamental promise in Hurst's Project EJECT: Empowering Jackson Expelling Crime Together.</p>

<p>In a March interview, Davis told the Jackson Free Press that by the nature of the federal system, people are "more than likely" sent out of the area.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Project EJECT is a controversial blast from the past.</p>

<p>'That's Not Fair to You'</p>

<p>Project EJECT did not come up on June 27, but the program did focus on guns. Gun crimes are a fundamental element of Project EJECT, from being a felon in possession of an armed weapon to armed robbery of businesses that do interstate commerce, such as Family Dollar.</p>

<p>Jeffery Artis of the Jackson Federal Bureau of Investigations, also a Project EJECT partnering entity, led a hand-raising activity.</p>

<p>About two-thirds of the teens raised their hand to say they knew someone who had been shot. Fewer raised their hands to indicate that they knew someone who had shot someone. Five kids put their hands straight up to say they felt they needed a gun, with some hands hovering shoulder height. About the same number raised their hands to say they felt they one day might be shot.</p>

<p>"That's sad. That should not be. You should not know someone that's been shot or that has shot someone. ...That's not fair to you," Artis said.</p>

<p>Artis did not want the youth to accept homicides as normal behavior, and mentioned that some places do not have any homicides at all, but failed to name any major cities with such a statistic. The current homicide count in Jackson hovers at 51 at press time.</p>

<p>Mayberry was vulnerable with the kids and related to the violence in Jackson from personal experience, as younger kids' shrill voices from the connecting room competed with hers in the echoing gym.</p>

<p>"I have classmates ...behind bars, I have classmates who did not make it to 35 (years old)," Mayberry said. She encouraged the kids to think about where they want to see themselves as adults.</p>

<p>"I Will Never Bring a Gun to School' </p>

<p>Toward the end of her presentation, Mayberry rolled local-news footage of juveniles in orange jumpsuits facing adult charges and strolling by cameras for perp walks in the now-outlawed practice in Jackson following a Jackson Free Press analysis of the effects of sensationalizing youth crime.</p>

<p>The program at the Boys and Girls Club put emphasis on making better choices and choosing to stay in school because poor decisions lead to crime, as one PowerPoint slide summated.</p>

<p>"I came to talk to you all today because your decisions matter—your decisions matter to me," Mayberry said in her opening remarks.</p>

<p>The speakers put the onus on kids to make better decisions. However, crime stems from a host of other problems and situations, such as poverty, that do not fall under the purview of adolescent responsibility.</p>

<p>The afternoon closed with the teens and speakers gathering in a circle, holding hands and reciting a pledge against gun violence.</p>

<p>"I will never bring a gun to school. I will never use a gun to settle a personal problem or dispute. I will use my influence with my friends to keep them from using guns to settle disputes," the pledge reads.</p>

<p>The next events will take place on July 23 at the Boys and Girls Club on West Capitol Street and July 26 at the Boys and Girls Club on Sykes Road.</p>

<p>A press release said the U.S. Attorney's Office expects to reach more than 400 students in the metro area this summer, and the L.E.A.D. program will continue into the school year.</p>

<h2 id="abortionrightscouldbelitmustestforhighcourtnominee">Abortion Rights Could be Litmus Test for High Court Nominee</h2>

<p>by: The Associated Press</p>

<p>Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a key vote on President Donald Trump's pick for the Supreme Court, said Sunday she would oppose any nominee she believed would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Photo by Flickr/Medill DC</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Republican Sen. Susan Collins, a key vote on President Donald Trump's pick for the Supreme Court, said Sunday she would oppose any nominee she believed would overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.</p>

<p>The White House is focusing on five to seven potential candidates to fill the vacancy of retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, a swing vote on the court. The Maine senator said she would only back a judge who would show respect for settled law such as the 45-year-old Roe decision, which has long been anathema to conservatives.</p>

<p>"I would not support a nominee who demonstrated hostility to Roe v. Wade because that would mean to me that their judicial philosophy did not include a respect for established decisions, established law," Collins said.</p>

<p>Such a judge, she said, "would not be acceptable to me because that would indicate an activist agenda."</p>

<p>Trump spent the weekend at his New Jersey golf club conferring with his advisers, including White House counsel Don McGahn, as he considers his options to fill the vacancy that might make precedent-shattering court decisions on abortion, health care, gay marriage and other issues.</p>

<p>The president told reporters Friday that he was homing in on up to seven candidates, including two women, and would announce his choice on July 9.</p>

<p>Trump is expected to begin his search in earnest this week at the White House and said the process could include interviews at his golf club before he reaches a final decision following the Fourth of July holiday.</p>

<p>During his 2016 campaign and presidency, Trump embraced anti-abortion groups and vowed to appoint federal judges who will favor efforts to roll back abortion rights. But he told reporters on Friday that he would not question potential high-court nominees about their views on abortion, saying it was "inappropriate to discuss."</p>

<p>The Supreme Court legalized abortion in 1973, but anti-abortion advocates hope Roe v. Wade will soon be overruled if Trump gets the chance to appoint a justice who could cast a potentially decisive vote against it.</p>

<p>Without Kennedy, the high court will have four justices picked by Democratic presidents and four picked by Republicans, giving Trump the chance to shift the ideological balance toward conservatives for years to come. Both Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch, Trump's first pick to the high court, have indicated more broadly that they respect legal precedent.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Leonard Leo, an outside adviser to Trump on judicial nominations, said he expected Trump to select a nominee who is mindful of precedent but who is also more "originalist and textualist." That judicial approach typically involves a more literal interpretation of the Constitution, and not reading into the Constitution language that doesn't explicitly appear. Roe, for instance, relied on a right to privacy, which is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.</p>

<p>Possible nominees being eyed include Thomas Hardiman, who serves alongside Trump's sister on the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and Raymond Kethledge, a federal appeals court judge who clerked for Kennedy. Also of interest are Amul Thapar, who serves on the federal appeals court in Cincinnati; Brett Kavanaugh, a former clerk for Kennedy who serves on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.; and Amy Coney Barrett, who serves on the federal appeals court in Chicago.</p>

<p>Echoing Leo's view, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a member of the Judiciary Committee, said he didn't think Trump would be overly focused on the Roe ruling.</p>

<p>"You don't overturn precedent unless there's a good reason," Graham said. "I would tell my pro-life friends: You can be pro-life and conservative, but you can also believe in 'stare decisis,'" he said, citing the legal term involving legal precedent that means "to stand by things decided."</p>

<p>Republicans hold a narrow 51-49 majority in the Senate, and it's even closer because of the absence of ailing Sen. John McCain of Arizona. Even though McConnell changed Senate rules last year to allow confirmation by simple majority, if Democrats hold together, he cannot afford defections. Vice President Mike Pence can be called on to break a tie.</p>

<p>Collins appeared on ABC's "This Week" and CNN's "State of the Union," Leo spoke on "Fox News Sunday" and Graham was on NBC's "Meet the Press."</p>

<h2 id="interimjpdchiefjamesdavisstartsjobpermanentsearchunderway">Interim JPD Chief James Davis Starts Job, Permanent Search Underway</h2>

<p>by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-29</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba selected former Assistant Chief James Davis (pictured) to serve as interim chief of police of the Jackson Police Department on June 28, 2018. He is the second interim police chief under Lumumba this year. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — James Davis' first words as Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba's second interim chief of police were "Glory be to God." He uttered them yesterday in Jackson City Hall's ceremonial office, just dozens of feet away from where a dead body had been found hours before.</p>

<p>In response to a call from a concerned citizen, the Jackson Police Department found an unresponsive black man on the sidewalk in front of the Warren Hood building (directly across from City Hall) shortly before 7 a.m. on June 28. JPD believes the man had been assaulted prior to his death. The cause of death is pending results of an autopsy, and the victim's identity has yet to be released.</p>

<p>For a few hours after discovering the body, JPD taped off the streets around City Hall, and city employees who work in the Hood building had to use a rear entrance.</p>

<p>By the time the afternoon press conference rolled around, things seemed normal outside the municipal buildings, and aside from the mayor's brief mention that he could provide very little information about the open investigation, the announcements about the new interim chief went as planned.</p>

<p>In the 25 years Davis has been with JPD, he has moved up the ranks from 10 years as a patrol officer to the first African American range master at the training academy, to sergeant, to lieutenant of the 3rd Precinct, to district commander, to deputy chief, to assistant chief, and now interim chief. Davis also spent 15 years with the S.W.A.T. team, and has been a Jackson resident for 30 years. He hopes to become the mayor's ultimate choice to run the capital city's police force.</p>

<p>"Yes, I would like to be permanent chief," Davis said to reporters.</p>

<p>Mayor Lumumba said he will be "simultaneously commencing a permanent search for police chief" alongside Davis' appointment.</p>

<p>The mayor did not want to suggest that his administration had not yet begun searching for a permanent police chief since Chief Lee Vance stepped down in late December, but rather that he had been considering how things were progressing under the outgoing interim chief. Lumumba stressed that his administration is the first to face the state law that only allows interim employees to serve 180 days. This went into effect in July 2017—the same month of Lumumba's inauguration.</p>

<p>Anthony Moore, the city's first interim chief following Vance's retirement in December 2017, was not at the press conference yesterday. In his absence, Lumumba summarized Moore's six-month tenure, which included starting the officer-ID task force, eliminating the distribution of mugshots following officer-involved shootings and juveniles charged as adults, and bringing in the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations to investigate officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether or not Moore will even remain with JPD following this transition.</p>

<p>"I thought that (Moore) brought necessary leadership for the time that he was there, and we're thankful for his contribution," the mayor said. "He has been requested to continue to serve with the police department, and that is a decision that he is taking the time to deliberate on and see whether he feels that he can be of service. So we're looking forward to his response in that."</p>

<p>Davis will be able to put in his bid to be permanent chief, Lumumba said, and the mayor believes he will be a strong leader.</p>

<p>"We do seek stability, but at the same time our principled purpose is to make sure we make the right decision for the citizens of Jackson," Lumumba said. "I do believe that Chief Davis with his time in the police department will bring great leadership ... and the possibility that he could be the permanent selection."</p>

<p>When Davis stepped to the podium, he talked about implementing community-policing practices by setting an example. He promised that more of his officers, including the handful that stood behind him, would be visible in the communities so they can be proactive about crime.</p>

<p>"My beat officers, instead of driving through the community, I want them to slow down and talk to the kid on the corner—talk to Ms. Johnson on the porch," Davis said. "I do it, and I ask that they do it."</p>

<p>Davis also talked about collaborating with the community to solve crimes and using resources from federal partners. U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst was among the crowd in the ceremonial office.</p>

<p>"I'm just here today to show my support for the Jackson Police Department and let the public know that the U.S. Attorney's Office will continue to do its part in cleaning up the city of Jackson and protecting our citizens from violent crime," he told the Jackson Free Press after the press conference.</p>

<p>Hurst's brainchild to fight crime in Jackson is Project EJECT: Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together. Mayor Lumumba in the past has been hesitant to say that Project EJECT is a City initiative, although it makes use of JPD. But with more and more Project EJECT stings in the capital city in partnership with JPD, the collaborative effort is clear and will likely continue under Davis.</p>

<p>"We're going to reach out for all the resources that we possibly can to address the crime issues in Jackson," Davis said.</p>

<h2 id="ryansetshousevoteongopimmigrationbillforwednesday">Ryan Sets House Vote on GOP Immigration Bill for Wednesday</h2>

<p>by: The Associated Press</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-26</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Paul Ryan scheduled a long-awaited showdown vote on a broad Republican immigration bill for Wednesday, but is showing little confidence that the package will survive.</p>

<p>Underscoring the legislation's weak prospects in his GOP-run chamber, Ryan, R-Wis., declined to answer questions Tuesday about a separate, narrow measure Republicans are privately discussing. It would focus on the issue that has grabbed public attention in recent days: the Trump administration's separation of migrant children from their parents when families are caught crossing the border without authorization.</p>

<p>"If that doesn't succeed, then we'll cross that bridge," Ryan told reporters about his preference to focus on trying to pass the broader bill. "But the last thing I want to do is undercut a vote on what is a great consensus bill."</p>

<p>Many conservatives are preparing to vote against the wider ranging bill because it would provide a chance for citizenship for many immigrants who arrived illegally in the U.S. as children. They have blasted that provision as "amnesty," and the emerging, narrower bill would give them a chance to show they are addressing family separation without risking the wrath of hard-right voters.</p>

<p>The broader measure would also stop the Homeland Security Department from separating migrant families and provide $25 billion for President Donald Trump's border wall and other security measures. Democrats are expected to solidly oppose that bill, which is a compromise between GOP moderates and conservatives.</p>

<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., weighed in from across the Capitol, criticizing Trump for lacking a process for bringing families back together. Trump signed an executive order last week reversing his own administration policy of separating families, but many children remain apart from their parents.</p>

<p>"This administration needs to present a plan ASAP of how to unify the kids and how to deal with border. They have no plan," Schumer said.</p>

<p>Ryan praised the compromise GOP bill.</p>

<p>"What we have here is the seeds of consensus," he said. He predicted it would be the basis for legislation that eventually becomes law, "hopefully now but if not, later."</p>

<p>He also accused Democrats of favoring a return to the previous "catch and release" policy under which immigrants being prosecuted were released into the U.S. until their court dates. Under Trump's "zero tolerance" policy, more migrants are being prosecuted and therefore detained.</p>

<p>Ryan said Democrats would in effect "tell the world, 'You can just come to this country, we're not going to have closed borders.'"</p>

<p>Republicans exited a closed-door strategy session in the Capitol basement with little indication that party leaders had finally won enough over to approve the bill.</p>

<p>"You've got to be unified on this and I get the feeling we're not unified," said Rep. Paul Cook, R-Calif., who said he was still deciding what to do.</p>

<p>Looking to garner support, leaders added provisions making it easier for migrant agriculture workers to stay in the U.S. for longer periods, and requiring employers to verify workers' citizenship. But several lawmakers said those provisions hadn't addressed the major reason for GOP disaffection — opposition to helping young immigrants stay in the U.S. legally who broke laws to arrive.</p>

<p>"I don't think it advances the ball, I really don't," said Rep. Bradley Byrne, R-Ala.</p>

<p>A Senate Republican family separation bill would also add more immigration judges to reduce the backlog of cases, but Trump has opposed that, saying it would only lead to graft.</p>

<p>Still, many Republicans are eager to address the border crisis and distance themselves from the Trump administration's policy that has resulted in more than 2,300 migrant children being separated from their parents.</p>

<p>Lawmakers heading into midterm elections want to be able to show constituents they voted to end it. Some 500 minors have been reunited so far, officials said.</p>

<p>"I don't know why we wouldn't vote for a bill that keeps families together," said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas.</p>

<p>Senate Republicans have proposed legislation that would lift rules that prevent children from being held longer than 20 days in custody. It would add 200 immigration judges to more quickly process the claims.</p>

<p>Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has been holding discussions with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., to see if they can reach middle ground on what to do about separated families.</p>

<p>With the Senate's narrow 51-seate GOP majority, a compromise with Democrats would likely be needed to reach the 60-vote threshold usually required to advance legislation. But resolution seemed difficult.</p>

<p>Republicans are worried about leaving town for the weeklong July 4 recess without addressing immigration issues, particularly the family separations at the border.</p>

<h2 id="lawyerinflowoodofficerinvolvedshootingwantsvideoanswers">Lawyer in Flowood Officer-Involved Shooting Wants Video, Answers</h2>

<p>by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>A Flowood police officer shot into Von McDavid's car at a Kroger in Flowood on the evening of March 8, 2018. His lawyer, Dow Yoder, wants more details and for video to be released. Photo courtesy Flowood Police Department</p>

<p>JACKSON — On the evening of March 8, a Flowood Police Department officer unloaded his gun into Von McDavid's car somewhere between four and eight times. McDavid had gone to the exterior walk-up pharmacy at a nearby Kroger shortly before they were closing, and an employee there suspected McDavid of obtaining medication unlawfully, his lawyer, Dow Yoder, said.</p>

<p>An officer met McDavid in the parking lot, and then the story gets murky depending on who is telling it. Flowood Police Chief Richie McCluskey said in a statement released that same night that a preliminary investigation showed the responding officer attempted to arrest McDavid, who got into his vehicle and tried to run over the arresting officer.</p>

<p>"Our officer shot into the car, fearing for his life while attempting to get out of harm's way as the suspect continued through the parking lot and eventually crashed into a ditch near the intersection of Lakeland Drive and Grants Ferry Rd," McCluskey said in the statement.</p>

<p>The attorney representing McDavid, Yoder, contests that his client had committed a misdemeanor or felony crime to warrant arrest in the first place, let alone the use of deadly force. Yoder is a former assistant district attorney for Madison and Rankin counties and a former special assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Yoder told the Jackson Free Press that an officer approached McDavid, yelling and with his hands on a pistol, so McDavid got back in the car. He said the officer was standing about 3 feet from the passenger headlight of the car when McDavid cranked his car up and the officer drew his pistol.</p>

<p>His client was "freaking out," Yoder said, and felt like the officer was looking for an excuse to shoot him because he hadn't done anything wrong, adding when McDavid tried to put his hand on the gear shift, the officer unloaded. Yoder said McDavid turned his car away from the officer and drove off into a nearby ditch because "he figured that was better than being still and letting the officer kill him."</p>

<p>McDavid apparently told Yoder that when some officers came to that ditch, he felt they were "just looking at him hoping he was going to die in the ditch before the ambulance got there," he said in the interview.</p>

<p>McDavid was transported to the University of Mississippi Medical Center intensive care unit that night. Now he is at his mother's house recovering. Yoder said on Thursday he had spoken with McDavid's mother, whom he describes as a "sweet, wonderful Christian lady," and that she said her son's emotional and psychological injuries at this point are just as detrimental to him as the gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>The approach of giving officers wide discretion on whether to fire into a moving vehicle is not considered a national best practice for policing. The Police Executive Research Forum released a report in March 2016, "Guiding Principles on Use of Force," warning about the high dangers of shooting into moving vehicles.</p>

<p>Police officers shooting into moving vehicles has drawn national scrutiny in the United States due to the dangers it poses and not only to the driver. Law-enforcement experts warn that not only the targeted driver be injured or killed, but that an out-of-control vehicle then poses dangers to both the officers as well as bystanders and property. Officers should "move" out of the path of moving vehicles, policing experts advise, if at all possible and then follow specific procedures that should be part of their training.</p>

<p>Whether or not McDavid commited a crime is not clear, especially with the few details the Flowood Police Department has offered to date other than that the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations has stepped in to investigate. Yoder says a Flowood city clerk told him that his client does not face any pending charges so far.</p>

<p>The Flowood Police Department has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Jackson Free Press nor replied to voicemails left on various department's machines. Yoder laments the lack of transparency in this process.</p>

<p>"[I]t is very likely that now the Flowood Police Department is scrambling around trying to come up with evidence to justify what happened that they did not know about, and they did not have at the time (that) they used this unreasonably forceable pursuit and apprehension of apparently just someone they thought was suspicious."</p>

<p>Yoder's best hope is getting his hands on some video from either body cameras and/or Kroger video surveillance because without it, it is McDavid's word against the officer's.</p>

<p>"If there's not any clear video evidence that shows what really happens, guess who that favors? That favors the Flowood Police Department. Why? Because then it makes it a swearing match between one Flowood police officer and a suspect," Yoder told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"Most people are going to believe the police officer," he added. "But when a police officer shoots at a car, nine times and shoots somebody six times (who) was not under arrest at the time of the shooting, and at the time of the shooting there was no probable cause to make an arrest, then obviously that police officer is going to have a motive to justify what we did—and he's going to have an awfully hard time doing it."</p>

<p>LB • 3 months ago The JFP has done a great job covering Police involved shootings this year. The volume of police shootings should be cause for concern for all sides of the political spectrum: the Left has good reason to be concerned for the racial disparity of victims of police violence, and the Right has good reason to see police violence as a vast overstep of government authority. It should be a galvanizing issue.</p>

<p>But I think there is much more to this issue. Thus far in 2018 Jackson has had about 20 homicides (depending on how you count police shootings). The homicides overwhelmingly involve handguns. Perhaps we are best served to see the police shootings problem as part of a larger problem with gun violence in and around Jackson. Local officials appear to be silent on the issue. Other than the much-maligned Project EJECT, I am unaware of any steps taken by local officials to curb the problem. And other than the standard article detailing the latest shooting, I don't see local writers/commentators seeing this issue as a bigger problem.</p>

<p>From my vantage point, the work of the JFP was instrumental in getting a policy discussion started on police violence. I hope to see a similar policy discussion started about the larger issue of gun violence in Jackson.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd Moderator LB • 3 months ago Thanks, LB. I appreciate that. As you may know, we've dedicated a lot of time and words to our crime-prevention beat in recent years with much of the work at jfp.ms/preventingviolence. We saw a blip from it with at least one council member (Priester) and several mayoral candidates (Horhn and Lumumba included) widening the conversation about policing and violence prevention here, including with guns. They both were talking in some way about violence interrupters/credible messengers, for instance, which we wrote extensively about as a potential solution (including the biggest one in U.S., cureviolence.org). And Horhn at least talked about the very-good BOTEC reports with causes and potential solutions for Jackson, and that was paid for by the Legislature. However, much of that conversation has died out recently, and we're left with old ideas proven both to have limited effectiveness as well as have potential for great racial disparities such as Project Eject. Fortunately, the push for an expanded gang law died (and it could easily have created more criminal gang members).</p>

<p>So I hope this policy discussion will get going sometime soon. I expected and would like to see Mayor Lumumba lead it, although we haven't heard much of substance from him, yet.</p>

<p>I am heartened that some prison reform/reentry legislation made it through the Legislature this session, pushed largely by conservatives like Rep. Bomgar and my new friend/frenemy (ha) Russ Latino (we may only agree on this!) and his organization). I'm waiting for the Dems to step up and be loud on these issues, including the white ones like AG Hood, who hasn't been great on criminal-justice/reform issues to date.</p>

<p>Donna Ladd Moderator Donna Ladd • 3 months ago Here's BOTEC gang violence assessment on Jackson with some interesting ideas. I'm probably less sold on Operation Ceasefire to date than they are, but if it's done right, it's so much better than what is done now to prevent and decrease gun violence here. I like the Peace Institute stuff a lot, which isn't as granola California as the name might sound!Donna Ladd Moderator LB • 3 months ago And for the record, I see the police shooting as vast overreach by the government as well. These issues really shouldn't be right or left on any of the reasons. We should all care about public safety, racial/other disparities, costs and how suspects are treated (ultimately determining if they will re-offend in many cases). It's not easy to tackle, but a good first step is taking dumb partisan politics out of the equation.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics announced this week that officials will now respond to the scene of every suspected overdose in the state in order to assist coroners and medical examiners in reporting deaths by opioid overdose. File Photo</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — In the wake of a national opioid epidemic, Mississippi is toughening its investigations of drug overdose deaths.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics announced this week that officials will now respond to the scene of every suspected overdose in the state in order to assist coroners and medical examiners in reporting deaths by opioid overdose.</p>

<p>Overdose reporting forms are also now available online as part of the Bureau's effort. Coroners and medical examiners are required by state law to report overdose deaths to the MBN, but they previously reported by fax. With online reporting, MBN hopes to make reporting faster and simpler.</p>

<p>MBN Director John Dowdy said he hopes the more dogged overdose investigations will help the Bureau crack down on deadly drug dealers more quickly.</p>

<p>"It is vitally important to be proactive in identifying the source of illegal narcotics," Dowdy told The Associated Press.</p>

<p>By immediately showing up to the scene of an overdose, Dowdy said MBN officials can launch into an investigation as soon as possible, talking to potential witnesses or recovering cell phone records to find the source of the fatal drug.</p>

<p>More than 50 state coroners and medical examiners comply with state overdose reporting mandates, according to the MBN, although there are 82 Mississippi coroners. Dowdy attributed this discrepancy to some counties not having "any overdoses to report," and noted that the number of reporting coroners has nearly doubled since 2016.</p>

<p>According to the Bureau, 255 Mississippians were reported to have died by drug overdose in 2017.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump declared the opioid epidemic a national public health state of emergency in October. More than 42,000 Americans died by opioid overdose in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- five times more than in 1999.</p>

<h2 id="updatedcitymayidcopswhodischargeweaponswithin72hoursestablishingtaskforce">UPDATED: City May ID Cops Who Discharge Weapons Within 72 Hours, Establishing Task Force</h2>

<p>by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p>Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore has not released the names of any officers who have shot at civilians since he took the position in January 2018. He is pictured here at a press conference on Feb. 26. 2018. Photo by</p>

<p>Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>A post on the NextDoor neighborhood website today revealed that the City of Jackson may change its policy and require that the Jackson Police Department start releasing names of the officers involved in a shooting within 72 hours, a best-practices period that the Jackson Free Press has supported in recent editorials.</p>

<p>JPD officers have been involved in at least seven shootings since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba took office last July, promising criminal-justice reform. JPD has not released the names of any of those officers who fired on civilians, leading to several deaths, nor detailed the circumstances of those shootings. The department cites the need for officer safety.</p>

<p>In the NextDoor post, a participant related that a JPD commander is asking citizens to push back against revealing the officers' names.</p>

<p>"[P]lease come to the (JPD headquarters downtown) tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. and the City Council Meeting at 6:00 p.m.," the post stated. "The city has proposed releasing the names of all officers involved in a shooting within 72 hours. The police are very against this. They and their families get death threats immediately from family and friends of the person who was shot. This is before the investigation into whether the shooting was justified or not. Frankly, this only enflames already heated emotions and puts our officers and their families at grave risk. If you're concerned for the safety of our officers, please come to the meetings. The Chief will explain their position at 11:00 and hopes we will all go to the Council to express our support for them."</p>

<p>JPD headquarters is at 327 Pascagoula St., near City Hall.</p>

<p>JFP city reporter Ko Bragg has reported that civilians, including family members of people killed by police, are demanding more transparency about the shootings.</p>

<p>In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice advised police departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident. Some cities release them as soon as 48 hours after the shooting. The DOJ report said that departments can take steps to ensure officer safety during those brief delays.</p>

<p>Lumumba recently announced that JPD would no longer release mugshots of people shot by police, after JPD sent out a blurry mugshot of an unarmed woman killed after at least one officer shot into her car and gave other media details of her minor police record. He also said JPD would no longer release mugshots of juveniles in custody, after an investigation by the Jackson Free Press of the practice.</p>

<p>The mayor also told the Jackson Free Press that is against JPD setting up "perp walks" of juveniles so that media can get photographs and footage of the accused children who are already in custody and are often later moved back to the juvenile-detention center where they are not available to the media. The Jackson Free Press also learned that juveniles charged as adults are often sitting in the detention center for 180 days without being indicted.</p>

<p>After this article appeared March 26, the mayor's office sent out the following statement early the next morning, announcing the task force. The full statement follows:</p>

<p>"The Jackson Police Department is committed to serving and protecting all Jackson residents and holds its officers to the highest standards of conduct. When officer-involved shootings do occur, accountability to the public and for the safety of officers is a primary concern. JPD has a long-standing practice of not releasing the names of officers involved in shootings during the performance of their duties. This practice was designed to ensure the safety of officers and their families and to enable the department to more efficiently conduct its investigation of the incident.</p>

<p>"We recognize that this practice can be difficult for victims and their loved ones involved in these incidents. Due to recent concerns raised about the lack of transparency inherent to this practice, Mayor Lumumba is establishing a task force to address the formation of JPD policy that will govern the release of names, and the timeframe during which this should take place. Specifically, the Task Force will be made up of citizens, officers and members of his administration who are charged with establishing policy that keeps in mind both sensitivity to community concerns as well as an understanding of the unique responsibilities and safety of law enforcement. We expect that this process will yield a policy that works for all stakeholders.</p>

<p>"We have confidence and trust in JPD—and we are indeed concerned with the frequency of officer- involved shootings. The loss of life is always tragic, and it is imperative that our policy reflect our genuine concern for the safety of everyone. We truly believe that through the work and deliberation of this task force, we will be able to strengthen the bonds between our officers and the communities they serve, while simultaneously building the transparency and trust necessary to move our great City forward."</p>

<p>NOTE: The NextDoor commenter later changed the location of the 11 a.m. Tuesday meeting with police about the new identification policy from the Fondren precinct to JPD headquarters downtown at 327 Pascagoula St. The change is reflected above.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Wayne Kuhn completed his sentence for a grand larceny charge in the 1980s more than 25 years ago. He even got his record expunged—and yet he still cannot vote in Mississippi.</p>

<p>"God forgives us, but Mississippi doesn't," he said this morning outside the secretary of state's office, across from the state capitol.</p>

<p>Kuhn is one of five named plaintiffs suing Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann in his official capacity over the state constitution, which bars certain Mississippians from voting ever again if they have been convicted of one of the list of 22 disenfranchising crimes.</p>

<p>A recent study from the Sentencing Project, One Voice and the NAACP shows that the list affects an estimated 218,181 Mississippians. In an analysis of 2016 data, researchers found that 93 percent of those disenfranchised on Mississippi's list live in the community—not behind bars.</p>

<p>Kuhn and four other men named in the complaint, brought by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett law firm, seek to have their voting rights restored, but the complaint also challenges the process for suffrage restoration in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Jonathan Youngwood, one of the attorneys representing the class, noted that while state law says a person must get a suffrage bill to pass through the Legislature by a two-thirds vote of the House and the Senate, other guidelines make the process arbitrary.</p>

<p>"Once you've served your time, you need to get your right to vote restored," Youngwood said.</p>

<p>He said that states could bar voting for a time period, but barring some Mississippians from voting permanently is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>The list of 22 disenfranchising crimes includes a broad range of felonies from receiving stolen goods to murder. The list dates back to a time in Mississippi history when white lawmakers targeted black men for certain crimes, in an effort to limit their right to vote.</p>

<p>Byron Coleman, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said he was convicted of receiving stolen goods several years ago. That felony is disenfranchising in the state of Mississippi. Coleman said he had paid his debt to society.</p>

<p>"Before I leave this world, I would like my record to be clear," he said this morning.</p>

<p>A measure that would have directed lawmakers and state leaders to study disenfranchisement died this year in the Legislature. The SPLC lawsuit is a federal class-action case, which challenges the constitutionality of Mississippi's disenfranchising crimes list as well as its suffrage process.</p>

<p>The family and friends of Lee Edward Bonner who died after JPD officers shot him on Feb. 21 gathered at the home where it took place to do a neighborhood cleanup on March 24, 2018, much like the ones Bonner organized when he was alive. Photo by Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — Sylvester Richard, 34, pulled up to Deer Park Street on Saturday, March 24, in a burgundy Chevy Tahoe sitting on 30-inch rims. He was at least an hour late, but seemingly not in a rush. He stopped to fist bump folks sitting outside of what looked like an abandoned building, but actually served as a makeshift pool hall. People danced on the corner outside of it and sipped from malt beers in 40-ounce bottles partially masked with paper bags.</p>

<p>"Here he comes, he's waving to his constituents," Richard's cousin Tetrina Blalock said as he got closer to her and the rest of their family and friends.</p>

<p>As Richard walked toward a blue tent set up in a dusty empty lot in the middle of the block where his family had gathered, everyone applauded as Blalock had encouraged everyone to do, as she made fun of him for rolling up like a celebrity.</p>

<p>The family had come together to do a neighborhood clean-up throughout the streets near the 1300 block of Deer Park Street, where Jackson police shot Richard's brother, Lee Edward Bonner, perhaps a dozen times about a month ago. Bonner was known for doing neighborhood cleanups and encouraging people around him to care about where they lived.</p>

<p>On Feb. 21, two plain-clothes detectives pursued Bonner and another man, whom JPD did not capture, in what police called a narcotics investigation. After a foot chase that led to an abandoned house on Deer Park Street with an overgrown yard, police say Bonner pulled put a gun and fired at the officers at least once, so they returned fire. Bonner died days later from injuries sustained during that shooting.</p>

<p>The family does not necessarily contest Bonner may have pulled a gun out, but they do see his death as "overkill." Richard told the Jackson Free Press his brother's left eye was gone when he made it to the hospital and that Bonner had been shot twice in the head, twice in the back, once in the left arm bursting the main artery there, twice in both sides, two times in the pelvis and twice more in the leg.</p>

<p>"It didn't take that many shots—he wasn't nothing but 130 pounds," Richard told the Jackson Free Press. "Nobody deserves that, they could have shot him in the leg, arm or anything. ... It's like they came with the intention to do that."</p>

<p>Richard's words are almost identical to what the grandmother of Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old black man Sacramento, Calif., police shot 20 times in her backyard on March 18 because they thought he had a gun, although it turned out to be a cell phone.</p>

<p>"They didn't have to kill him like that, they didn't have to shoot him so many times," Sequita Thompson said Monday about Clark at a press conference in Sacramento. She also believes they could have aimed for an arm or a leg, or used a Taser for instance.</p>

<p>In Clark's case, his community has been protesting on his behalf, even shutting down an interstate.</p>

<p>But, in Jackson, no one has taken to the streets for any of the last seven officer-involved shootings since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba took office in July 2017 with none of the officers involved identified to date. Bonner's brother wants police reform, but also for the community to come together and demand change—and more answers from JPD.</p>

<p>'I Know My Brother'</p>

<p>Richard looked out over Deer Park Street, which serves as a border of the west Jackson community he grew up in, just a stone's throw away from Jackson State University. He pointed out empty lots where more homes used to stand, and he reminisced about the corner store that now has wooden planks across the windows.</p>

<p>Richard sipped a grape Faygo that he was careful to throw into the trash when he finished, instead of casting it among the overwhelming litter that peppered the neighborhood. Richard reflected about the police harassing him and his brothers even when they were young—decades before Richard, Bonner and the brother in between them spent any time in jail.</p>

<p>Bonner had been out of jail for at least 10 months without violating his parole and it seemed that Bonner had been determined to stay out for good this time, Richard said.</p>

<p>"I know my brother—he tried," Richard said. "The way (the police) came at him...it was something very personal."</p>

<p>Blalock has also told the Jackson Free Press that she believes her cousin's shooting was personal. Richard and Blalock have both also said that Bonner had previously filed complaints against the officers who shot him, but a JFP records request to the JPD turned up no such documents. Still, Richard contends that the detectives were in Deer Park on Feb. 21 to be bothersome, not for a narcotics investigation.</p>

<p>"They ain't find no drugs on him, at all period," Richard said.</p>

<p>Richard also takes issue with the way JPD was quick to release that his brother was a convicted felon. Having a criminal record himself, Richard does not see being a good person and a convicted felon as mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>"You look at a (whole) person, you just don't view them from their background," Richard said. "You don't know what a person does for the community."</p>

<p>Stepping Up</p>

<p>Less than 200 feet from the place where Bonner had been shot, a blue T-shirt was cloaked around the sign as if it moonlighted as a mannequin. On the shirt, screen-printed white doves flittered above Bonner in a blue fitted cap with the brim to the rear. Above the image on the shirt reads "Justice for Lee Bonner."</p>

<p>Family and friends gathered in that yard to pray before the cleanup, and many had on various T-shirts with Bonner's picture pressed onto them. As they bowed their heads, surrounding a shrine with white candles and a wooden cross with a blue bandana tied around it, the remnants of a blue foil balloon in the tree branches crackled in the wind. It had gotten caught during the balloon release and candlelight vigil the family had hosted the week Bonner had passed. Bonner's godmother stepped out of the prayer circle as she began to cry.</p>

<p>JPD's silence on the shooting compounds this community's and family's grief. Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba put out a statement Tuesday about developing a task force to review how JPD releases names and the timeframe in which that happens in efforts to examine the "longstanding practice of not releasing the names of officers involved in shootings," the statement reads.</p>

<p>A precinct meeting at JPD headquarters held an hour after that statement came out drove home the fact that JPD does not believe in releasing names of officers who shoot civilians because they fear retaliation, with citizens at the meeting agreeing wholeheartedly. Officers encouraged attendees to speak at the City Council meeting later that night to voice their concerns—even though the matter was not on the council's agenda.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Bonner family has not been idle. Blalock spoke on behalf of the family at a Jackson City Council meeting at the end of February, holding city officials' feet to the fire and demanding an independent investigation and more details. She hopes citizens can come together the way many did for the "March for Our Lives" rally that took place the morning of the Bonner-family cleanup.</p>

<p>"If black people could organize like that, boy...," Blalock said before trailing off.</p>

<p>Richard has his demands ready, too. He wants JPD to use body cameras, and he does not believe in JPD's protocol of placing officers who shoot civilians on administrative leave because he sees it as a paid vacation. And like his cousin, he wants the community to step it up, even as far as protesting; otherwise the same things will go on, he says.</p>

<p>Although Richard said he often keeps to himself these days, he has not given up on the idea that they may one day get justice for his oldest brother. "I think with him being a convicted felon, they didn't think we were going to step up like this," he says.</p>

<p>I didn't need the murders of Jackson residents to let me know that the city is a police state. I didn't need the Lumumba administration to move in lockstep with the Jackson Police Department and refuse to hold officers accountable in the face of terror to understand that the mayor is a high-ranking official in the police state.

<p>Adofo Minka</p>

<p>We live in a police state.</p>

<p>That is when a government uses organized force to act arbitrarily and violently against the interests of the masses of people, rendering them subjects instead of citizens. The term encompasses the institutions of policing, prosecutor's offices, the prison system, courts, the surveillance-state apparatus and government as we currently know it.</p>

<p>Historically, governments have used that power to enforce the hegemonic rule of the State and corporate interests that a few control to the detriment of the many. Anyone who doesn't believe we live in a police state is either living in an alternative universe or has willfully blinded themselves to the reality that has beset us.</p>

<p>I didn't need the murders of Jackson residents to let me know that the city is a police state. I didn't need the Lumumba administration to move in lockstep with the Jackson Police Department and refuse to hold officers accountable in the face of terror to understand that the mayor is a high-ranking official in the police state.</p>

<p>I didn't need to see poor people's human rights systematically violated to understand that what passes for a justice system in Hinds County and throughout the state of Mississippi is a vile station of oppression and degradation. U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst didn't have to threaten Jackson's majority-black and mostly poor population with the violation of basic constitutional principles, and international human rights norms and standards to let me know it is open season on poor and black people in Jackson. These are all symptoms of a deeper malady.</p>

<p>When I reflect on the ongoing police-state violence locally, I am reminded of the timeless words of George Jackson, "... understand the reality of our situation, understand that fascism is already here, that people are already dying who could be saved, that generations more will live poor butchered half-lives if you fail to act."</p>

<p>What will it take for more of us to challenge the hegemonic rule of the police state? What will it take for us to see that the dominant narratives around crime and violence only lead us in circles? How many more people will police have to kill before we demand the upending of the status quo?</p>

<p>In the midst of this raging debate about gun control, gun violence and criminality, we must reflect deeply. Who is controlling the narrative, and where are they trying to lead us? Whose interests are "leaders" serving? What is more violent than the racially bigoted police state domestically? What is more violent than the U.S. military industrial complex globally? Martin Luther King Jr. said that the greatest purveyor of violence in the world was the U.S. government. This still rings true.</p>

<p>Our primary focus must be on state violence because that begets all other violence. We have been socialized and indoctrinated to view state violence as legitimate. It is not. We must not be led astray by hypocritical politicians and misleaders who claim to abhor violence in Jackson and other urban cities, but will go to Congress and vote for President Trump's $700-billion war budget. This kind of recklessness wreaks terror and havoc on poor and black people around the world. Governments do it in the name of greed, imperial power and the further entrenchment of the status quo.</p>

<p>We must build a grassroots movement to dismantle the police state, abolish the prison system as we know it and defund the military industrial complex.</p>

<p>Checks and balances are important in law enforcement. Citizens pay taxes for police officers to uphold their end of the bargain, not for officers to have unique protections they do not afford the citizens they have sworn to serve and protect. Photo by</p>

<p>Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>When it comes to police transparency, Jackson is on a volatile tectonic plate that could cause tremors at any moment. Especially when City officials are the ones off-kilter and inconsistent.</p>

<p>Since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba brought in Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore earlier this year, there have been three officer-involved shootings, two of them fatal. On Tuesday, Lumumba announced a future task force to review the Jackson Police Department's policies of withholding the names of officers who shoot civilians. An hour later, Moore hosted a meeting at the JPD Headquarters, where his officers expressed that they are "100 percent" against identifying officers who shoot civilians with most in attendance, with attendees asking how they could support officers in this "fight." JPD encouraged attendees to speak at the city-council meeting later that evening.</p>

<p>Across town, the Bonner family could not agree less with JPD's protocol. They lost Lee Bonner after two plain-clothes detectives shot him between eight and 17 times on Feb. 21.</p>

<p>In Tuesday's meeting, the department did not hear from people who might not wholeheartedly praise everything they do—those who want to be protected and hold police accountable at the same time, to ask that JPD walk and chew gum with us.</p>

<p>Checks and balances are important in law enforcement. Citizens pay taxes for police officers to uphold their end of the bargain, not for officers to have unique protections they do not afford the citizens they have sworn to serve and protect.</p>

<p>JPD has been quick to send out mugshots of police-shooting victims and those merely accused of a crime, even juveniles, providing no details if they are later cleared. This same department refuses to see the irony in refusing to identify officers who shoot citizens.</p>

<p>Police badges do not grant the superpowers to unleash an impenetrable force field around officers who shoot civilians and taxpayers. The police are not free from criticism and reform, and neither is our mayor. Moore and Lumumba need to quickly get on the same page before apparent infighting causes an earthquake.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A federal judge in Mississippi has extended his temporary block on the most restrictive abortion law in the United States.</p>

<p>The Mississippi law bans abortion after 15 weeks. Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed it March 19. The law took effect immediately, but the state's only abortion clinic sued the state.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves issued a temporary restraining order March 20 to block the law for 10 days.</p>

<p>Reeves on Wednesday extended the block until April 13, giving attorneys for the clinic and the state more time to work on legal arguments.</p>

<p>The law and the responding lawsuit set up a confrontation sought by abortion opponents, who are hoping federal courts will ultimately prohibit abortions before a fetus is viable. Current federal law does not.</p>

<p>JACKSON — In the lead-up to this year's legislative session in Mississippi, supporters of a tougher gang law in the state talked a lot about the need to arrest white people. But in an ironic twist, the Jackson Free Press has learned that everyone arrested under the existing gang law from 2010 through 2017 were African American.</p>

<p>Over the last year, members of the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators worked to spread the message that not all gang members in Mississippi are African American, Hispanic or another ethnicity. In fact, they warned, many of the state's toughest gang members are now white, between the growing Simon City Royals, white supremacist groups like the Aryan Brotherhood, and biker "clubs" such as the violent Bandidos, started by a white Marine in Texas in 1966 who would later be convicted of murder.</p>

<p>How Mississippi pursues people believed to be in gangs.</p>

<p>In August 2017, MAGI told The Clarion-Ledger that 53 percent of verified gang members, a number presumably pulled from the dozens of identified criminal groups in the state, are white. It is a potentially surprising statistic in the state with the highest proportion of African Americans in the nation and that experiences a large amount of media coverage of its black and Hispanic gangs.</p>

<p>The Mississippi State Gang Assessment, published in December 2017, listed the white Simon City Royals as the third largest criminal street gang in the state behind the Black Gangster Disciples and the Vice Lords, both black gangs. In addition, MAGI members regularly provide examples of heinous crimes by white gang members, such as the murder and dismemberment of a Royals snitch on the Coast in 2016. Welford Lee McCarty is now serving a life sentence for murder charges.</p>

<p>MAGI's recent message was clear: The state's gang investigators are not fixated on black gangs and do not want the expanded gang law in order to profile young people of color. When asked to comment on the 53-percent-white report, Pascagoula District Attorney Tony Lawrence told the Jackson Free Press via email: "I have not seen that statistic and cannot comment on it, but I can say, in remembering gang cases in my office, I have prosecuted more white gang members for crimes than of any other race."</p>

<p>Prosecuting someone for a specific crime who happens to be a gang member and prosecuting someone, or adding on additional sentences, for being a member of a gang are two completely different things, however.</p>

<p>It is not talked about a lot in the push for an expanded gang law, but Mississippi already has a gang law on the books. The Mississippi Streetgang Act, passed in 2001, targets "three (3) or more persons with an established hierarchy that, through its membership or through the agency of any member, engages in felonious criminal activity." That is, much like the FBI does with the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, called RICO, the State can go after a group that conspires together to commit a criminal act. That is different from making it illegal to be part of a gang and thus being held responsible for crimes other members might commit separately, as the failed gang law this session could have done.</p>

<p>But despite MAGI frequently warning that white gang members pose a strong threat in today's Mississippi, the arrests and prosecutions under the existing street-gang law have only targeted African Americans, State Public Defender Andre de Gruy pointed out to the Jackson Free Press after the expanded gang law failed this session.</p>

<p>The Administrative Office of the Courts confirmed that from fiscal-year 2010 through 2017, court disposition data show that 97 people were processed under current gang law. All of them were black.</p>

<p>Of those 97, 22 pled guilty, four were dismissed, one faced house arrest, 11 were no-billed (dismissed), one was non-adjudicated, 53 remanded/passed to the file* and five had probation revoked, the Administrative Office of the Courts confirmed.</p>

<p>"From 2010 to 14 it was seldom used—fewer than 30 dispositions," de Gruy explained in an email. "The last two years of data indicate 32 indictments disposed of per year. These came from 5 of 22 districts but primarily from Forrest and DeSoto counties."</p>

<p>Mississippi's Administrative Office of the Courts uses the following racial/ethnic classifications: white, black, American Indian, Asian, Hispanic and unknown.</p>

<p>The State's 2017 gang-threat assessment found that 413 Simon City Royals had been in custody in DeSoto County last year, but that does not mean they were prosecuted under existing gang law. The assessment also pointed out that a Forrest County gang member, part of the 74 Hoover Crip Gang, was arrested in 2015 for capital murder and other felonies for killing two police officers. The Forrest County Corner said he died later that year in jail from heart disease. (Note: The assessment was found during the 2018 legislative session to have dramatically over-counted the number of gang members in Mississippi prisons.)</p>

<p>De Gruy, who opposed the expanded law due to both costs and the potential to profile people of color, says more information is needed to fully vet who the current gang law is already targeting. He would like more information about the dispositions under the existing law, including who was under 18 at the time of charge.</p>

<p>He also suggested that gang laws could use a way to check them for racial profiling. "[A] provision could be crafted to review the racial impact annually," de Gruy said.</p>

<p>On the Senate floor, the sponsor of this session's expanded gang bill, Senate Bill 2868, deflected concerns that expanded gang laws are used to profile Mississippians of color. ""It's not a Republican, Democrat(ic), black or white (issue)," Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, told black lawmakers during the debate.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Author's note: The data provided by the Administrative Office of the Courts listed separate numbers for "remanded to the file" and "passed to the file," which I originally included separately above. Those mean the same thing, and I have edited the above story to reflect that and added links to explain the various dispositions. I also listed the race/ethnicity categories that the office uses to categorize after a question about it. Hispanics are not included in the "white" category.</p>

<h2 id="deadoralivewhatbillssurvivedordidntinthe2018legislativesession">Dead or Alive: What Bills Survived, Or Didn't, in the 2018 Legislative Session</h2>

<p>by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-29</p>

<p>A lot of bills with big-ticket items, including rewriting the state's education funding formula and diverting more money to roads and bridges, died in the 2018 legislative session. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Lawmakers went home on Wednesday, March 28, well before the Easter deadline, but not before they passed a $6-billion budget, with most state agencies receiving funding levels comparable to what they got last year.</p>

<p>Leaders diverted some additional funding to universities, public education and the State's foster-care system in the fiscal-year 2019 budget, which begins July 1. While the budget is intact, many other Republican priorities and proposals died this session. Here is a short list of what survived and what did not.</p>

<p>Bills That Survived</p>

<p>Medicaid Technical Amendment</p>

<p>Mississippi's Division of Medicaid is primed for a new era after the Senate confirmed Drew Snyder as its new director. The House and the Senate eventually agreed on language in the technical-amendment legislation that removes doctor visit and prescription-count limits so Medicaid recipients can stay healthier. The legislation also ensures that managed-care companies that provide coverage under Medicaid cover the costs for patient visits to obstetricians and gynecologists, as well as prescriptions to help prevent preterm births.</p>

<p>Re-entry and Criminal Justice Reforms</p>

<p>The governor signed House Bill 387 this week, which ensures that Mississippians do not go to jail or prison automatically just because they fail to pay fines and fees. Under the new law, judges must assess a person's ability to pay. Another re-entry bill will stop the State from suspending drivers' licenses for all drug violations that federal drug law authorizes, unless the offense involves driving under the influence of a controlled substance. Senate Bill 2841 also lengthens the amount of time a person on parole or supervision has to pay a fee to 90 days instead of 30 days. It also instructs the Mississippi Department of Corrections and judges to assess indigence before sending a person to prison for not paying their fines.</p>

<p>Bond Bill</p>

<p>Lawmakers authorized about $280 million in bonds this session for the Institutions of Higher Learning, community colleges, some State agencies and the Ingalls shipyard on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The bond bill also includes $50 million for the local bridge program. Lawmakers also approved bonds for the Mississippi Development Authority to administer business and facilities grants.</p>

<p>15-Week Abortion Ban</p>

<p>Republicans pushed a 15-week abortion ban, the first in the nation, through the statehouse earlier this month. The law was in place for less than 24 hours after the governor signed it when Jackson Women's Health Organization, the state's only abortion clinic, challenged the law in federal court. This week U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves extended the temporary restraining order against the measure to April 13.</p>

<p>Foster Care Administrative Changes</p>

<p>If Gov. Bryant signs Senate Bill 2675, Mississippi's foster-care system will be housed within but operate independently of the Department of Human Services. The merger is necessary for Child Protection Services to receive federal funding for the foster care system.</p>

<p>Bills That Died</p>

<p>Transportation Funding Plans</p>

<p>It was only a year ago when the House attempted to force a conversation with the Senate on roads and bridges on deadline night, March 27, 2017. They ultimately created a special session to pass a few budget bills. This year, the House jumped out front in road and bridges funding discussions, but their proposals were untouched until Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves introduced his "BRIDGE" Act a few days before a deadline day. Ultimately, disagreement about how to divert additional funding to infrastructure died again this year, despite the Republican supermajority.</p>

<p>Ed-Formula Re-write</p>

<p>More than a year ago EdBuild presented the Legislature with a proposal for a new weighted student funding formula to fund Mississippi's public schools. In 2017, legislative leaders did not file a bill, however. This session, House Speaker Philip Gunn did file a bill, and while it made it out of the House, it died in the Senate after enough senators voted with Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, to kill the proposal.</p>

<p>'Anti-Gang' Act</p>

<p>Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, and Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, pushed "anti-gang" legislation that would have broadened the definition of a "gang" as well as add an additional penalty and sentence for any crime proved to be "criminal gang activity," for a minimum of five years and up to 15 years in prison. The Legislative Black Caucus held a hearing on the potential costs of the bill, and the legislation ended up dying.</p>

<p>Disenfranchisement Study Committee</p>

<p>A measure to create a study committee to look at Mississippi's suffrage and disenfranchisement laws died in the Senate this year. Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, said he plans to study the current disenfrachisement laws anyway this summer. On Tuesday, five men and a class of Mississippians disenfranchised from voting brought a federal lawsuit with the Southern Poverty Law Center against Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann. They are challenging the State's disenfranchising list of crimes that prevents some Mississippians from voting forever as well as the process to gain suffrage.</p>

<h2 id="lawyerinflowoodofficerinvolvedshootingwantsvideoanswers-1">Lawyer in Flowood Officer-Involved Shooting Wants Video, Answers</h2>

<p>by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-30</p>

<p>url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/30/lawyer-flowood-officer-involved-shooting-wants-vid/ </p>

<p>A Flowood police officer shot into Von McDavid's car at a Kroger in Flowood on the evening of March 8, 2018. His lawyer, Dow Yoder, wants more details and for video to be released. Photo courtesy Flowood Police Department</p>

<p>JACKSON — On the evening of March 8, a Flowood Police Department officer unloaded his gun into Von McDavid's car somewhere between four and eight times. McDavid had gone to the exterior walk-up pharmacy at a nearby Kroger shortly before they were closing, and an employee there suspected McDavid of obtaining medication unlawfully, his lawyer, Dow Yoder, said.</p>

<p>An officer met McDavid in the parking lot, and then the story gets murky depending on who is telling it. Flowood Police Chief Richie McCluskey said in a statement released that same night that a preliminary investigation showed the responding officer attempted to arrest McDavid, who got into his vehicle and tried to run over the arresting officer.</p>

<p>"Our officer shot into the car, fearing for his life while attempting to get out of harm's way as the suspect continued through the parking lot and eventually crashed into a ditch near the intersection of Lakeland Drive and Grants Ferry Rd," McCluskey said in the statement.</p>

<p>The attorney representing McDavid, Yoder, contests that his client had committed a misdemeanor or felony crime to warrant arrest in the first place, let alone the use of deadly force. Yoder is a former assistant district attorney for Madison and Rankin counties and a former special assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Yoder told the Jackson Free Press that an officer approached McDavid, yelling and with his hands on a pistol, so McDavid got back in the car. He said the officer was standing about 3 feet from the passenger headlight of the car when McDavid cranked his car up and the officer drew his pistol.</p>

<p>His client was "freaking out," Yoder said, and felt like the officer was looking for an excuse to shoot him because he hadn't done anything wrong, adding when McDavid tried to put his hand on the gear shift, the officer unloaded. Yoder said McDavid turned his car away from the officer and drove off into a nearby ditch because "he figured that was better than being still and letting the officer kill him."</p>

<p>McDavid apparently told Yoder that when some officers came to that ditch, he felt they were "just looking at him hoping he was going to die in the ditch before the ambulance got there," he said in the interview.</p>

<p>McDavid was transported to the University of Mississippi Medical Center intensive care unit that night. Now he is at his mother's house recovering. Yoder said on Thursday he had spoken with McDavid's mother, whom he describes as a "sweet, wonderful Christian lady," and that she said her son's emotional and psychological injuries at this point are just as detrimental to him as the gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>The approach of giving officers wide discretion on whether to fire into a moving vehicle is not considered a national best practice for policing. The Police Executive Research Forum released a report in March 2016, "Guiding Principles on Use of Force," warning about the high dangers of shooting into moving vehicles.</p>

<p>Police officers shooting into moving vehicles has drawn national scrutiny in the United States due to the dangers it poses and not only to the driver. Law-enforcement experts warn that not only the targeted driver be injured or killed, but that an out-of-control vehicle then poses dangers to both the officers as well as bystanders and property. Officers should "move" out of the path of moving vehicles, policing experts advise, if at all possible and then follow specific procedures that should be part of their training.</p>

<p>Whether or not McDavid commited a crime is not clear, especially with the few details the Flowood Police Department has offered to date other than that the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations has stepped in to investigate. Yoder says a Flowood city clerk told him that his client does not face any pending charges so far.</p>

<p>The Flowood Police Department has not responded to multiple requests for comment from the Jackson Free Press nor replied to voicemails left on various department's machines. Yoder laments the lack of transparency in this process.</p>

<p>"[I]t is very likely that now the Flowood Police Department is scrambling around trying to come up with evidence to justify what happened that they did not know about, and they did not have at the time (that) they used this unreasonably forceable pursuit and apprehension of apparently just someone they thought was suspicious."</p>

<p>Yoder's best hope is getting his hands on some video from either body cameras and/or Kroger video surveillance because without it, it is McDavid's word against the officer's.</p>

<p>"If there's not any clear video evidence that shows what really happens, guess who that favors? That favors the Flowood Police Department. Why? Because then it makes it a swearing match between one Flowood police officer and a suspect," Yoder told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"Most people are going to believe the police officer," he added. "But when a police officer shoots at a car, nine times and shoots somebody six times (who) was not under arrest at the time of the shooting, and at the time of the shooting there was no probable cause to make an arrest, then obviously that police officer is going to have a motive to justify what we did—and he's going to have an awfully hard time doing it."</p>

<h2 id="lawmakersturntobudgetsreentryreformsongovernorsdesk">Lawmakers Turn to Budgets; Re-Entry Reforms on Governor’s Desk</h2>

<p>by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-21</p>

<p>Lawmakers sent Gov. Phil Bryant (pictured) a measure that will expand re-entry reforms in the state’s criminal-justice system. Bryant has until March 26 to sign the measure; he vetoed a similar bill last year. Trip Burns/File Photo</p>

<p>JACKSON — It's crunch time at the Mississippi Capitol. This week lawmakers will have to finalize the state budget, predominantly behind closed doors, before passing a slim fiscal-year 2019 budget. So far, legislators plan to spend about $70 million less than they did last year, House of Representative budget documents show.</p>

<p>Representatives, so far, appear willing to increase funding for the Mississippi Adequate Education Program this session, despite Republicans' failed attempts to re-write the education funding formula. The Senate budget proposal does not increase funding for education, however.</p>

<p>The House budget also calls for enough funding to keep the Mississippi Department of Mental Health at the same budget levels as last year. The U.S. Department of Justice is currently litigating a case against the state for its over-reliance on institutionalization in mental-health care.</p>

<p>Lawmakers will be forced to make tough decisions this week, however, as the lawsuit against the state's foster-care system, called "Olivia Y," requires more than $35 million than what is currently allocated for the agency, as the new commissioner told reporters last week. Without those funds, the still relatively new division of Child Protection Services could risk going into federal receivership.</p>

<p>Bills to Watch This Week</p>

<p>This measure authorizes the Division of Medicaid, and six lawmakers will work to come to a compromise between the House and Senate positions. Both chambers support allowing Medicaid to cover opioid and other drug-addiction support services. Lawmakers will likely make decisions about the number of hospital admissions and increasing the number of prescriptions for Medicaid recipients in their conference report for this bill.</p>

<p>Last year, lawmakers were forced into a special session after the two chambers could not agree on transportation funding. The House has thrown out myriad proposals, and this year Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves decided to introduce his own proposal, called the "BRIDGE Act."</p>

<p>That bill, which includes some bonds for infrastructure needs as well as creates two new state funds to target road and bridge funding, could mean $1 billion for infrastructure in the next five years—if revenue meets certain triggers, specifically more than a 1-percent increase in sales tax growth. The measure includes $240 million in immediate funds for infrastructure. House Bill 354 would also divert any surplus funds above 2-percent growth to infrastructure needs in the state.</p>

<p>Both transportation funding measures are in conference, and senators and representatives will have to agree on how much money to set aside for roads and bridges.</p>

<p>What started as a means to ensure that Mississippians with enhanced-carry licenses can carry firearms on campuses, including in athletic events, has turned into a measure to allow schools to establish "safety programs" as well as slightly tightening state gun laws. The author of the measure, Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, indicated on social media that he is not open to some of the Senate's changes. "Bottom line: a new restriction of existing concealed carry rights is something I just cannot support. I doubt that surprises anybody," he wrote on Facebook. This measure is likely to go to conference, if the House chooses to keep it alive. The deadline for the House to concur with the changes the Senate made is Thursday.</p>

<p>Re-Entry Bill on Governor's Desk</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant has until Monday, March 26, to sign House Bill 387. This year clergy and conservative groups, including Right on Crime, supported the bill, which will keep Mississippians out of jail if they cannot afford to pay fines or fees. The measure will allow lawmakers and groups of public officials to continue studying disparities in the state's criminal-justice system, including how judges issue sentences for various crimes. The bill also gives judges the option to deviate from the "habitual offender" law, offering an explanation if they do not want to give the maximum sentence state law requires for a Mississippian's "third strike."</p>

<h2 id="ohtheplacesyoullgoprojectejectexpelsgunoffenderstofarawayprisons">Oh, the Places You'll Go: Project EJECT Expels Gun Offenders to Faraway Prisons</h2>

<p>by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-21</p>

<p>url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/21/oh-places-youll-go-project-eject-expels-gun-offend/ </p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst announced Project EJECT (Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together) on Dec. 7, 2018, with then-Jackson Police Chief to his right and Christopher Freeze, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Jackson, to his left. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>In November 2017, Ledarious Anderson apparently thought he was going on a date with a woman named Alexus Guster, but he was headed to a set-up. Two men, Darrell Moore and Cedric Winfield, allegedly told Guster that she would receive a portion of the take from a robbery if she could get Anderson to meet up with her. Guster agreed and lured Anderson via Facebook, an affidavit shows.</p>

<p>Guster told Anderson to meet her at the Arbor Park Apartments near Clinton, where she stood waiting with Winfield, whom she introduced as her brother when Anderson pulled up in his 1999 red Pontiac Grand Am. Guster and Winfield talked to Anderson from his passenger side, and while he was distracted, Moore came to the driver's window with a firearm. Moore pulled Anderson out of the car and took $200, court documents say.</p>

<p>Anderson apparently ran away as Moore shot at him. Winfield then drove off in the stolen Grand Am, and Guster left with Moore in his car, authorities say.</p>

<p>But it wasn't just the robbery, or the aiding and abetting, or the shooting that landed the trio in federal court, where they are much more likely to be sent away to faraway prisons outside Mississippi. Rather, the fact that the Grand Am had been transported, shipped and received through interstate commerce—meaning it crossed a state line—makes Guster, Moore and Winfield early offenders charged under U.S. Attorney Michael Hurst's "Project EJECT."</p>

<p>"Carjacking is a federal crime because the car was manufactured in interstate commerce," Hurst said in his office in February. Thus, so was a plan to steal a vehicle made outside the state in this local incident.</p>

<p>Hurst has charged 32 others since he first announced the anti-crime initiative in late 2017, like Bobby Ray Mahone and Latesha Vavuris, who allegedly held up a Family Dollar store in October 2017. Like the other case, it is not robbery per se that put them within Hurst's jurisdiction rather than the more typical route of state or local criminal charges, even for acts committed with guns. Their robbery allegedly interfered with interstate commerce because customers from outside the state can purchase items inside the store.</p>

<p>Every single case Hurst is pursuing under Project EJECT involves illegal use or possession of firearms in some way under an initiative U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has resuscitated from the years before Barack Obama became president.</p>

<p>'Making America Safe Again'</p>

<p>On a cool, breezy and overcast morning this past December, U.S. Attorney Hurst called a press conference on the steps of the U.S. District Court in downtown Jackson. President Donald Trump had appointed Hurst in a second wave of U.S. attorney nominees and described him as sharing "the President's vision for 'Making America Safe Again,'" the June 29, 2017, White House announcement reads.</p>

<p>A sign with a large red button and "Project Eject" written across the center leaned on a tripod easel. He had invited media, Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith, Hinds County Sheriff Victor Mason, FBI Special Agent in Charge Christopher Freeze, and clergy to stand by him as he unveiled Project EJECT (Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together).</p>

<p>"Today is a new day," Hurst began, adding, "(T)he message to violent criminals in Jackson is simple: you break the law, you terrorize our neighborhoods and you will be ejected from our community."</p>

<p>Hurst's goal to "eject" violent criminals into federal court and then prisons outside the state is much like Project Exile in Richmond, Va., in the 1990s, which sent felons into "exile" for firearm violations. Freeze of the FBI, in fact, worked for the agency in Richmond at the time, back when James Comey was the U.S. attorney leading the program there. Freeze started pushing a version of Exile in Mississippi soon after he arrived in late 2016.</p>

<p>"Project Exile was founded and based on the concept that if you're a convicted felon, caught in commission of a crime, with a weapon, there's a five-year automatic sentence to federal prison," Freeze told WDAM in Hattiesburg in April 2017.</p>

<p>"I've talked to some of our partners in the Jackson area and some of our state partners to kind of hear them out and see if they think it would be viable," Freeze said then. "The U.S. Attorney's Office would be a big part of that, so certainly their willingness and ability to be a partner in that regard will be something we are discussing and will further discuss with them."</p>

<p>Freeze found a willing partner in Hurst, who said on Dec. 7 that a dozen special agents from both federal and state agencies had already begun collaborating with local law enforcement and going out to crime scenes with JPD officers to identify crimes he can prosecute. Those cases go to Hurst's office, and a task force determines if there is enough evidence to prosecute suspects in the federal system. Hurst said then that authorities will lock suspects up immediately in detention without bond, and law enforcement will not cut a deal so the suspect could be out in a few months.</p>

<p>Here's where the ejection comes. Once convicted, the theory goes, the felon would spend time without parole in the federal system "far, far away from Mississippi so that they cannot continue their criminal activity behind bars," Hurst said in December. The federal system no longer offers parole.</p>

<p>The idea is that the criminals would be away from their criminal networks and, thus, be likely to commit less crime. They would also be removed from their families and existing support networks while in prisons known for rough gang activity, a problem even Hurst described in an interview.</p>

<p>The state involvement comes at the hands of DA Smith, who committed to provide cases that can be prosecuted federally in order to free up the his resources. He is scheduled to face trial himself in Rankin County in September 2018 for domestic-related felonies involving a firearm.</p>

<p>Then-Jackson Police Chief Lee Vance also stood next to Hurst at the announcement to show support for the initiative. Vance, who later resigned at the end of 2017, said at Hurst's press conference that his "greatest wish" for the strategy is that a young man in Jackson rethinks a life of crime and will rethink his actions after watching others go to federal prison "for a long time, perhaps thousands of miles away from here."</p>

<p>Vance's replacement, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore, has been tight-lipped on virtually everything, including Project EJECT, despite the Jackson Free Press' requests to interview him since he took over the position on Jan. 2.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has offered few public statements on Project EJECT, despite public criticism of it. The same day the interim chief was announced, Lumumba told the Jackson Free Press that he and Moore had not yet had a chance to discuss it, but the mayor emphasized that the two spoke about ensuring good relationships between police and community.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, citizens are forcing a public conversation about Project EJECT.</p>

<p>City's 'Sphere of Influence'</p>

<p>Calandra Davis approached the wooden podium during the time allotted for public comments at the Jackson City Council meeting on Feb. 27. She said she moved back to Jackson a year ago and is not pleased with local policing strategies—including Project EJECT.</p>

<p>Jacksonian Calandra Davis expressed her dissatisfaction with Project Eject in Jackson over the last year at a city council meeting on February 27, 2018.</p>

<p>"During my time back, the police in the City have implemented the Project EJECT program, and there have been at least seven officer-involved shootings," Davis said. "And to realize that this program and these shootings affect African-Americans disproportionately should raise concern for all of us...."</p>

<p>When Davis finished, the mayor wanted to clarify the City's involvement with Hurst's brainchild.</p>

<p>"Project EJECT is (not) and has never been an initiative of the City," Lumumba said. "... This administration has never said it is in favor of Project EJECT, we have never made any comments on Project EJECT. In my opinion, it may be out of our sphere of influence. What our police department is tasked with doing is investigating cases."</p>

<p>The mayor added that the City can neither make the feds prosecute cases nor stop them from prosecuting them in either federal or state court. He did, however, offer some criticism of Hurst's approach.</p>

<p>"I will say that some of the comments that were made during the (Hurst) press conference where it talked about people not getting bonds and everything else was inappropriate," the mayor said then. "I don't think that it is even within the sphere of influence of the people who said it because a prosecutor doesn't dictate whether somebody gets a bond—a judge dictates whether somebody gets a bond."</p>

<p>Hurst agreed with that statement in his office in February, backtracking from the promises of his earlier press conference. "Oh, yeah, people have misconstrued what I said at the press conference," he said. "... We are only a part of the judicial process, and our part will be to move for detention." He pushed back on the suggestion this his promises meant violating people's rights to bond; they will suggest no bond, he said. "We're moving for detention, and the judge makes a decision based upon the facts."</p>

<p>Hurst also made it clear in his office that he knows the federal system does not offer parole, so it cannot be rescinded.</p>

<p>At council, Calandra Davis also wanted to know if the mayor was explicitly in favor of Project EJECT, which is focusing solely inside Jackson and in no other parts of the state so far, Hurst said. Council President Charles Tillman of Ward 5 did not let the mayor respond, grunting into the microphone to vocalize his disapproval, and shaking his head "no" to illustrate it further. The mayor did not get to speak further on the EJECT strategy.</p>

<p>But, before he was interrupted, Lumumba added that Project EJECT is a federal initiative from three or four years ago, when former U.S. Attorney Gregory Davis was in office, which he had told the Jackson Free Press earlier, saying it was a program the Obama appointee oversaw.</p>

<p>In his office, Hurst also pointed out that Davis had used the same approach as EJECT but by a different name. "My predecessor Greg Davis had really focused on violent crime his last few years in Jackson," Hurst said. "I'm really building off what he had started and with direction from the president and Attorney General Sessions. They really wanted to make violent crime a focus of this administration."</p>

<p>For Sessions, that meant bringing back a controversial approach to prosecuting gun crimes federally with mandatory sentencing as part of the innocuous-sounding, but highly controversial, Project Safe Neighborhoods initiative, which predated Obama and Davis and drew charges of racial bias.</p>

<p>The divide between police and black communities is about more than white cops.</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of a better place to start that here in the Southern District of Mississippi than in Jackson," Hurst said in February. "Seeing what Greg had done and how federal law enforcement in particular had worked with the state and locals, we thought it would be good to reboot the old Project Safe Neighborhoods into our own initiative called Project EJECT."</p>

<p>Obama Era to Trump Era</p>

<p>Former U.S. Attorney Gregory K. Davis said Project EJECT is not, in fact, the exact same, and added some nuance to both Lumumba and Hurst's use of his name to justify the enforcement approach.</p>

<p>"There have always been, sort of, initiatives in place to address violent crime," Davis said in a March 13 interview. "And I think the Jackson Violent Crime Initiative that we started ... was kind of a prelude to some of these initiatives that are going on now. I think (Project) EJECT may have just been an initiative with the current administration. They may have changed it up somewhat, but it's still a program to address violent crime."</p>

<p>Davis said his iteration did not specifically threaten to send convicted criminals far away from Mississippi. Even if a judge recommends people serve time as close to Jackson as possible, the Yazoo City facility is the state's only federal prison for them. The other federal prison, in Adams County, is mainly used for immigration. So, people would likely go beyond state boundaries if convicted of federal gun crimes. That's just the nature of the prison system, Davis said.</p>

<p>"We didn't come out and say 'we're going to eject you from the City of Jackson,'" Davis said. "Our issue was more so that violent people need to be prosecuted, the law needs to be enforced, and once they're sentenced, they will be sent to a prison. More than likely that would be at a different location other than a local area."</p>

<p>Davis' Violent Crime Initiative aimed to remove violent offenders from the streets to make communities safer. A lot of the charges under his initiative were similar to the ones Hurst is pursuing. Forty percent of the people charged under Hurst's Project EJECT as of Feb. 26 were felons in possession of a weapon. In a press release from August 2015, seven of the 10 people listed for either charges or indictments under Davis' Violent Crime Initiative were previously convicted felons in possession of a firearm. Five of those 10 people are serving time in federal prisons now.</p>

<p>By Stephen Wilson</p>

<p>At either a judge's recommendation or luck of the draw, some of the aforementioned 10 went to Yazoo City. Others went to Arkansas, West Virginia, Florida or Georgia. Davis did not set out to have people who commit violent crimes sent far away like Hurst; that is where they landed.</p>

<p>Davis explained that federal-local partnerships to rein in violence are not new; they get recycled and rebranded with each new administration. He modeled his policies toward violent crime after national initiatives from Obama-era U.S. Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.</p>

<p>Holder launched a "Smart on Crime" initiative in 2013 to de-prioritize prosecuting non-violent crime and encouraged U.S. attorneys to use scarce federal resources mainly for violence prevention to help prevent the crime before it happened rather than rely on the threat of arrest and prison, which can actually lead to worse crime.</p>

<p>To that end, Lynch added Jackson to the Violence Reduction Network, which the U.S. Department of Justice framed as a "comprehensive program" to leverage resources and provide a "hands-on approach" to reducing violence in targeted cities across the nation. Little came of it here because it was late in the Obama administration. The City has not announced any programs or resources associated with it since Sessions became attorney general.</p>

<p>Hurst's initiative is more consistent with Sessions' law-and-order, tough-on-crime positions, which focus on enforcement over prevention, at least so far.</p>

<p>In February 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing Sessions to establish and to appoint or designate an individual or individuals to chair a task force on crime reduction and public safety.</p>

<p>"A focus on law and order and the safety and security of the American people requires a commitment to enforcing the law and developing policies that comprehensively address illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and violent crime," the order reads.</p>

<p>By June 2017, Sessions had his partnership in place to go after gun violence. In October 2017, Sessions sent a memo to all U.S. attorneys reviving Project Safe Neighborhoods, a George W. Bush-era initiative he deemed successful, which had cost the government about $2 billion since its inception in 2001.</p>

<p>That strategy propelled Hurst's office to secure indictments such as Guster's, Moore's and Winfield's under Project EJECT rather than allow them to go to state court. When asked if he was fearful or hopeful about how things will go in the U.S. Attorney's office now, Davis seemed torn.</p>

<p>"I'm both," Davis said. "I'm hopeful the good things we did will continue, and ..." Davis paused for a beat, choosing not to delve into any qualms he may have had. "Let's just say, I'm hopeful that it will continue," he added.</p>

<p>Ceasefire Fires Back</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Hurst, who comes across as perennially cheerful, now has the Project EJECT sign on an easel outside his office in the sleek federal courthouse building in downtown Jackson. In February, he explained the inspiration behind Project EJECT.</p>

<p>How Police Can (and Cannot) Deter Gunfire</p>

<p>"On the prosecution side, we're not reinventing the wheel," he explained. "We're taking a lot of what has been done in other cities, whether it be Richmond (Va.) with Project Exile or Boston with (Operation) Ceasefire or Baton Rouge. A lot of cities have done this—focusing federal resources on local violent crime."</p>

<p>The violence expert who helped design Operation Ceasefire—which launched as the Boston Gun Project in 1996—did not mince words a couple weeks later when asked about Project EJECT and its earlier models in Richmond, Va., Rochester, N.Y., and other cities in the U.S.</p>

<p>David Kennedy disdains Project Safe Neighborhoods as an anti-violence approach, calling Sessions' crime strategies "evidence-free", despite violence statistics its proponents cite to prove otherwise. Not to mention, he said, strategies like EJECT and Exile have little to do with his Ceasefire approach, which is often referred to as the "Kennedy model" of violence deterrence.</p>

<p>"One of the innumerable mistakes is to say that Project Safe Neighborhood was built on Kennedy's work," Kennedy said in his office at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York where he is a professor. "... That's not right. It was in a small way based on my stuff. ... We produced the first research that really showed there was such a thing as illicit markets in firearms."</p>

<p>But the approach that became Project Exile under U.S. Attorney James Comey in Richmond ignored vital aspects of his team's work to decrease group violence, Kennedy said, calling his work "a partnership approach focused on groups."</p>

<p>"The other (approach) was Exile, which actually has its roots in opposition to my work," Kennedy added.</p>

<p>Unlike Operation Ceasefire, Project Safe Neighborhoods declined to focus on how violent people get firearms, whether legally or illegally. The Exile approach, which was also endorsed by the National Rifle Association, puts the prosecutorial onus on the street-level shooters with little attention to where the supply of weapons came from or how to stop it. That led to charges of racial disparities, and contributed to increased distrust between police and communities of color, Kennedy said.</p>

<p>The Operation Ceasefire approach, which Kennedy's team now brings to cities through the National Network for Safe Communities, is about prior engagement with those believed likely to commit gun violence, offering them help and services, and also threatening them with arrest on the state or federal levels if they or their associates commit violence. It is also about identifying illicit markets for weapons. And those trafficking the weapons aren't usually the young black people who get caught up in federal Exile-type enforcement.</p>

<p>Initially, the NRA liked his approach, Kennedy said, but redirected its support away from a program that identified illicit markets to supporting the street-level federal arrests the Bush administration adopted. Those arrests sent a disparate number of people of color to a gang-packed prison thousands of miles away for additional years, while not bothering to also focus on how they got the guns in the first place. Kennedy also said the federal prosecutions were brought unevenly, deepening distrust in communities toward law enforcement.</p>

<p>In his office, Hurst backed away from Ceasefire when asked if his alliance was also including the services and prevention side of the strategy, as Kennedy's approach requires. "It's really not something, that aspect of Ceasefire, we have not really considered. (EJECT is) really going to be more in line with Exile. It's almost Exile Plus in the sense of Exile was very strong. But I don't know how much of the prevention and, yeah, re-entry they did, but it's hard to argue with their numbers during the time."</p>

<p>Kennedy does argue with the numbers of Richmond's Exile and all its clones. Violent gun crime did fall dramatically in Richmond then, but it did not in other cities that emulated the strategy, raising his suspicion that more was going on, he said.</p>

<p>"The reason we know Exile doesn't work is ... because there's a small body of really good formal evaluations ... that say it doesn't work," Kennedy said. "I'm not aware of any place where (Exile) was associated with violent crime reduction."</p>

<p>"What else was going in Richmond at the time? Was there something else that accounted for the reduction?" he added.</p>

<p>Jackson ostensibly tried an Operation Ceasefire approach at one time called "MACE" supposedly modeled on Baton Rouge's BRAVE strategy, but a Jackson Free Press investigation found that local law enforcement just left out the services and outreach components and used the resources for massive enforcement, which violates the principles of Ceasefire.</p>

<p>'The More That You Learn'</p>

<p>Wearing the red-and-white top hat illustrated in Dr. Seuss' "The Cat in the Hat," U.S. Attorney Hurst posed with Jackson Public School students at Johnson Elementary School for Read Across America Day on March 2. In his later tweet with snapshots next to the majority-black class, Hurst quoted from a different Seuss book.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst's March 2 photo from "Read Across America Day" at Johnson Elementary School. Photo courtesy Twitter</p>

<p>"The more that you read, the more things you will know," the U.S. attorney tweeted. "The more that you learn, the more places you'll go."</p>

<p>It was the second school visit Hurst had made in two weeks. On Feb. 21, he spoke at a Teen Town Hall meeting hosted by Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a subsidiary of Washington D.C.-based Council for Strong America at Jim Hill High School with Interim Jackson Police Chief Anthony Moore.</p>

<p>Hurst also tweeted after that event, which students there say did not focus on Project EJECT, with a nod to his new initiative. "You can do absolutely anything you put your mind to!" Hurst wrote on Feb. 21. "Empowering Jackson Expelling Crime TOGETHER #ProjectEject."</p>

<p>Juan Cloy, a former Jackson police officer who was assigned to the FBI's Safe Streets Task Force, is the Mississippi project director of Fight Crime, a nonprofit to help prevent youth crime. Cloy was at Jim Hill and said the event went pretty well.</p>

<p>"The whole gist of it is to first of all bring youth and police closer so they can have some common ground and some understanding of what each other needs from each other," Cloy said in February.</p>

<p>Cloy said Hurst showed up at the town hall because he cares, and that conversations between law enforcement officials and children help build trust. Cloy said the event was an informational dialogue rather than a scare tactic, per se.</p>

<p>Still, "Hurst said in the town hall (that) he didn't want to see young kids going to federal prison, Cloy recalled.</p>

<p>The conversation did include what can happen when someone enters the federal system. Cloy said he did not know about the accuracy of Hurst's threats about prison at the December EJECT announcement. From Cloy's experience, particularly with repeat offenders he arrested on the federal task force, a lot of prisoners ended up going to the federal prison in Yazoo City. Where you end up just depends on the judge and the Bureau of Prisons, Cloy said.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, Cloy said, no one would need to go to prison. He wants to approach the justice system with the kind of equilibrium David Kennedy talks about—balancing the stick of arrest with compassion and programs that preempt people from entering the system, especially kids.</p>

<p>"So what we're trying to do is keep young people from even being introduced into the federal system or into the local or state system...," Cloy said.</p>

<p>"That way we don't have to worry about any acronyms at all, right?"</p>

<p>Former U.S. Attorney Gregory Davis said Project EJECT differs somewhat from his violent-crime initiative.</p>

<p>Greg Davis agrees. While in office, the former U.S. attorney had an initiative called LEAD: Mississippi's Legal Enrichment and Decision Making Program. Through it, he spoke to students around the state about staying on the right path—but still focusing on what would happen if they did not.</p>

<p>"One of my primary goals as a prosecutor is to prevent crimes from happening in the first place," Davis told a group of students at N.R. Burger Middle School in Hattiesburg in October 2014.</p>

<p>"Educating students about the social and legal consequences of their decisions is essential to reducing negative behavior and making our communities safe," he added.</p>

<p>Hope and Consequences</p>

<p>When Hurst announced Project EJECT, he grinned as he drew connections between his initiative and basketball—particularly what happens when you commit a foul against another player.</p>

<p>"Goodness knows, I had my fair share of fouls," Hurst said in December. "But, if you intentionally, flagrantly violate the rules, you will be ejected. That's the consequence. What we're announcing today with Project EJECT are consequences, but also hope."</p>

<p>Hurst added that even if you get ejected from a basketball game, you don't have to leave the sport for life. Rather, you can come back the next game and abide by the rules. He sees the same thing happening for people sentenced far from home under Project EJECT.</p>

<p>"Come back after you serve your sentence, be rehabilitated, abide by our rules, and we will welcome you back with open arms in our community," Hurst said.</p>

<p>Not everyone who has been in prison or involved with efforts to rehabilitate criminals takes such a rosy approach, however, especially to sending prisoners far away from their families and expecting them to come back as better citizens ready to work.</p>

<p>John Koufos, the national director of re-entry initiatives for the Koch family-funded Right on Crime, was in Jackson recently to urge conservatives to support prison reform and re-entry. A former felon in New Jersey, Koufos slammed the idea of ejecting offenders to another state.</p>

<p>"Many times ... you've got people locked up all over the country. How are you supposed to re-integrate these folks back into the community when they're in Kansas?" he said at the Old Capitol Inn.</p>

<p>Hurst holds firm, though, that the threat of being shipped away can lower violence. "That's kind of the deterrent effect that we're looking at here. I understand the opposing arguments that, and that's definitely a concern," he said in his office.</p>

<p>Promising ejection is key to the strategy, Hurst emphasized. "The thinking behind that is to send a message that we're going to eject you from our community," Hurst said in his office. "I know that's tough love, but it's combined with the fact that if you want to come back and follow along, we really will help you re-enter society. It can't just be tough love; it's got to be that (promise of help)."</p>

<p>Re-entry: Trend or Reality?</p>

<p>The non-law enforcement piece of Project EJECT involves the faith-based community, nonprofits, neighborhood associations and businesses, Hurst said. In fact, local stakeholders represent the "T" in EJECT—together. Hurst wants business owners to give people a second chance once they have served their time and returned.</p>

<p>He does talk about getting to the root cause of crime through prevention, education, rehabilitation, communication and collaboration, but it is not built into Project EJECT with federal resources and strategies behind it. Hurst made his limitations clear, and leaned on the community behind him instead to achieve better communities.</p>

<p>"We don't have all the answers, guys," Hurst said in December. "Project EJECT is fluid, flexible for a reason so we can adapt to the changes and circumstances, and frankly rely upon the expertise of these men and women standing behind me."</p>

<p>Jeff Sessions has been less clear, quiet even, on re-entry, especially when compared to his predecessors. In his October 2017 Safe Neighborhoods memo, Sessions promised a "comprehensive approach" to public safety, including prevention, enforcement and re-entry efforts. But he mentions re-entry only twice, and suggested supporting locally based groups' re-entry efforts, as Hurst later echoed.</p>

<p>That is, the feds bring the big stick, and locals fund the prevention carrot.</p>

<p>Both Holder and Lynch had zeroed in on re-entry efforts as well. Lynch, in particular, had a National Re-entry Week that Davis implemented here in Jackson, he said. He stressed the importance of re-entry efforts for both the offender and the citizens in community.</p>

<p>"Re-entry is important because what happens is this," Davis said before pausing and releasing a long sigh. "Once someone has paid their debt to society, they need to have an opportunity to re-enter society and be a productive member.</p>

<p>"If they re-enter society and they're not prepared, unable to get a job, unable to have a driver's license, unable to get health care needs, unable to get whatever services that they should have to allow them to be productive, then they run the risk of re-offending."</p>

<p>Recidivism after spending time in violent prisons is an epidemic. "If somebody re-offends, they have another victim ..." Davis said. "And that's one way you reduce crime, by not having people who get out re-offend."</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Phillip Goff, co-founder and president of the Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, delved into the risks of removing people from their social supports by way of federal projects like EJECT.</p>

<p>The criminal-legal system tends to be comprised of the poorest, most vulnerable, poorly educated, least advantaged and least connected to opportunities, and those prosecuting them do not tend to be of that demographic, he said in a phone interview.</p>

<p>"The people making decisions about removing folks, shunning folks, and excommunicating them from their homes are often not the same people who are in community with those committing crimes," Goff said. "That's a fundamental flaw with the way that we handle the criminal-legal system right now."</p>

<p>Goff does not consider programs like EJECT that remove people from their support networks to be forward-looking; rather, they make re-integration more problematic, he said.</p>

<p>"What are the chances of when that person gets out, their lives can be transformed?" Goff said.</p>

<p>"Who among us ... can be removed from social networks and become better for it? Any policy that removes someone from their social support is not a policy that is aimed at making them more likely to succeed when they re-enter...."</p>

<p>Thirteen people are going to trial in the next two months before a federal jury of their peers to decide whether they will be among the first ejected from Jackson under the strategy that Hurst, Freeze and Sessions embrace, with support from the City of Jackson.</p>

<p>Alexus Guster already took a plea deal for her part in the car theft, but Cedric Winfield and Darrell Moore will go to trial on May 8, and if found guilty, they could be off and away, far from their families.</p>

<h2 id="editorialpublicofficialsgetfactsstraightonprojecteject">EDITORIAL: Public Officials, Get Facts Straight on Project EJECT</h2>

<p>by: Editorial Board</p>

<p>Hurst frames Project EJECT as a violent-crime fixer. He promises safer streets by sending Jacksonians who qualify for federal charges to faraway federal prisons, revoking their bond and parole. Photo courtesy Flickr/Neil Conway</p>

<p>There are two sides to the proverbial Project EJECT coin: what the public hears and what actually happens. In December, Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst announced the initiative and the meaning behind his acronym: Empower Jackson Expel Crime Together. Since then, Jacksonians either get minimal information, or public officials have just been wrong.</p>

<p>Hurst frames Project EJECT as a violent-crime fixer. He promises safer streets by sending Jacksonians who qualify for federal charges to faraway federal prisons, revoking their bond and parole.</p>

<p>The U.S. attorney cannot deny bond or parole himself and admitted later there is no parole in the federal system, and hasn't been since the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. He also cites Operation Ceasefire as a model for EJECT, but was not clear on what it actually involves. Not to mention, its primary designer is clear that EJECT is very different from the Ceasefire approach.</p>

<p>When Hurst announced the project, he alluded to some of the most heinous gun crimes committed in Jackson in the last few years: the Kingston Frazier case and the ambushed woman shot at a red light last summer. But those suspects are charged in those crimes, and in reality, this project has targeted felons in possession of a firearm for almost half the cases as of Feb. 26.</p>

<p>Then there are our local officials. Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba claims the City is not involved with EJECT, although Jacksonians' tax-funded police department has been a named participant in this initiative since former Police Chief Lee Vance helped announce it. Interim Chief Anthony Moore, is tight-lipped on it. And DA Robert Smith is facing his own gun-related felony.</p>

<p>Lumumba also said EJECT is the same program former U.S. Attorney Greg Davis implemented under President Obama. That is not precise, either, nor does Hurst's approach include the preventive measures that Davis embraced. Project EJECT is a City initiative as long as JPD helps implement it. It's that simple.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippians accused of felonies who cannot afford their own representation have the right to counsel and a speedy trial under the 6th Amendment, but a new report found that access to adequate representation across 10 Mississippi counties is lacking and far from consistent.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Public Defender Task Force released a 100-plus-page report today, produced by the Sixth Amendment Center, detailing how indigent defense plays out in 10 county-court systems in the state including Hinds, DeSoto, Forrest, Adams and Pearl River counties.</p>

<p>"I feel very strongly that Mississippi would benefit in multiple ways from a well- organized and adequately funded state defender system so we wouldn't have great disparity in the quality of legal representation in different parts of the state," Mississippi Supreme Court Justice James W. Kitchens, chairman of the Public Defender Task Force, said in a press release.</p>

<p>The report found that the state has no way of ensuring that local counties and governments are guaranteeing effective representation for indigent Mississippians accused in felony cases in the trial courts. Often, judges select inexperienced attorneys to represent these defendants, the report found.</p>

<p>"Even an attorney newly graduated from law school and having just passed the bar examination can be assigned to represent an indigent defendant in the most serious of non-capital felony cases where the defendant faces life in prison if convicted," the report says.</p>

<p>The report, which took three years of research to complete, also found what other advocates have long said about the pre-trial detention in the state. In the 10 courts studied, defendants charged with felonies experienced a long delay the authors describe as a "black hole" between the time of arrest and arraignment and then the grand-jury indictment.</p>

<p>"On average the delay between arrest and grand jury indictment in the 10 studied counties range from two months to over a year," the report says.</p>

<p>In 2017, the ACLU, MacArthur Justice Center and the 8th Circuit Court District Attorney's office, along with the judges in that district, in Mississippi reached a settlement agreement to ensure that every person has a right to pre-trial representation. That agreement affects Leake, Neshoba, Scott and Newton counties.</p>

<p>The re-entry council's suggested changes are on the governor's desk to sign. House Bill 387 creates the Mississippi Sentencing Disparity Task Force to study the disparities in sentences judges give for the same crimes throughout the state.</p>

<p>The report outlines several recommendations for the Legislature to create a state-level entity that would create and monitor standards for public defenders statewide.</p>

<p>State Defender Andre de Gruy, a member of the task force, said his office is responsible for developing plans for a statewide public defender system.</p>

<p>"We believe this comprehensive study of our current statewide practices will demonstrate the urgency of our task," he said in a press release.</p>

<p>"Every government expenditure should be based on evidence-based study, and there must be accountability. Utilizing the recommendations in this report, OSPD and the Public Defender Task Force will be able to provide the Legislature with a plan to correct the deficiencies in the current splintered system while retaining those aspects that are working well," de Gruy said.</p>

<p>Correction: A previous version of this story reported that Gov. Phil Bryant had signed House Bill 387. He has not signed the measure yet. We apologize for the error. </p>

<h2 id="analysisfostercareagencyseeksmoneytomeetmandates">Analysis: Foster Care Agency Seeks Money to Meet Mandates</h2>

<p>by: The Associated Press</p>

<p>Former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Jess Dickinson (center), pictured here with his wife Janet (left) and Justice Jim Kitchens (right), became the commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services in September 2017.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi legislators are approaching the final phase of patching holes in the current year's state budget and writing a $6 billion spending plan for fiscal 2019, which begins July 1.</p>

<p>Budget writers face deadlines in late March, and the Department of Child Protection Services is among the agencies requesting more money for this year and next.</p>

<p>The agency is trying to fulfill a federal court order to improve Mississippi's long-troubled foster care system, and Jess Dickinson inherited financial problems when he became director in mid-September. Like his predecessor, David Chandler, Dickinson served as a Mississippi Supreme Court justice before Gov. Phil Bryant moved him over to lead the child welfare agency.</p>

<p>Dickinson told The Associated Press last week that he's not assigning blame for the budget deficit that existed when he started the job.</p>

<p>Child Protection Services is part of the larger Department of Human Services, but under a law enacted in 2016, it has been working toward becoming a stand-alone agency by this July.</p>

<p>Human Services has subsidized the Child Protection Services' budget by using state money to bring in federal money - a "matching" program that's available to Human Services but could not be used by Child Protection Services as a stand-alone agency.</p>

<p>Dickinson told lawmakers months ago that Child Protection Services was facing a $50 million shortfall for the current year. The agency saved money by cutting some contracts. And Human Services was again able to use federal matching money to help out. Those changes reduced the current year's shortfall to $12 million, and Dickinson is asking legislators to provide that money.</p>

<p>The Joint Legislative Budget Committee recommends that the state spend just under $98 million on Child Protection Services in fiscal 2019. That's the same amount originally budgeted for the current year. However, Dickinson said to meet federal court requirements, the agency needs $133 million for the coming year.</p>

<p>It could be a difficult request to fulfill because money is tight.</p>

<p>Mississippi had 5,538 children in foster care Thursday, with 1,457 of them — about 26 percent — coming from the coastal counties of Harrison, Jackson and Hancock. Dickinson said drug traffic along the Gulf Coast likely accounts for some child abuse. He said abuse cases also increased after the 2010 oil spill, when people lost jobs.</p>

<p>A 2004 federal lawsuit filed against Mississippi said children had suffered abuse because of shoddy work in the foster care system. Republican Bryant has often said since becoming governor in 2012 that improving foster care is one of his main goals.</p>

<p>Marcia Lowry is an attorney and executive director of A Better Childhood, a group based in Chappaqua, New York, that is among those suing the state. She said in a March 5 letter to state attorneys that she intends to ask a judge to find the state is out of compliance with a court order.</p>

<p>The court order required Child Protection Services to have at least 50 percent of its workers in compliance with a certain level of caseloads by Sept. 30. Dickinson said the agency met that level. But the requirement increased to 90 percent of workers being in compliance by Dec. 31, and he acknowledged that the agency does not meet the higher level.</p>

<p>"Given our current funding level, we have kind of reached a plateau. This is, really and truly, absent some appropriate funding for this agency, we are doing about the best we can do," Dickinson said Thursday. "I don't have enough case workers. I don't have enough supervisors. I don't have enough resources to do it, given the money."</p>

<p>JACKSON — Terry Beasley remembers a white guy locked in his cell in East Mississippi Correctional Facility one night in 2017, dying. "He was blue," Beasley, an inmate serving a life sentence for a homicide-murder conviction, said in U.S. District Judge William Barbour's courtroom on Friday, March 9.</p>

<p>Some inmates started banging on their windows to try to get the officers' attention, but it took more than an hour for officers to come down to the man's cell from what he could tell from his own cell that night, Beasley said. Eventually, medical staff and the captain came into the zone and recovered the man's body.</p>

<p>"It made me feel scared because I'm a diabetic, and you never know when your sugar (could) drop," said Beasley, who is also asthmatic and diabetic.</p>

<p>Beasley used to clean out cells at the prison in Lauderdale County. On the stand, he described life "in the zone" at one of Mississippi's three private prisons in federal court. He testified that he misses his morning insulin treatment "a lot" whenever the officer in the tower does not let him out of his cell to go get the medication.</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Prison Project of the ACLU and two other law firms brought a class-action lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections back in 2013 due to conditions at EMCF. After the department refused to settle twice, the case went to trial this month in what is expected to be at least a month-long ordeal.</p>

<p>Operated by the Utah-based Management and Training Corporation since 2012, EMCF is one of three private prisons in the state that MTC operates. MDOC is responsible for the facility and stations a monitor there to track how the facility operates. More than 80 percent of the inmates there are on some type of mental-health medication or treatment protocol.</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that conditions at the prison violate the Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners housed there. Attorneys must prove in court that inmates receive "cruel and unusual punishment" as a result of being housed there.</p>

<p>The State of Mississippi hired two private law firms to defend MDOC in the case. Their position is that the department is not "deliberately indifferent" to the treatment of inmates at the prison. In his opening statement, W. Thomas Siler Jr. encouraged Judge Barbour to go see the facility for himself. He said EMCF has made great strides and changed a lot since MTC took over the facility in 2012.</p>

<p>"We disagree with their conclusion that we're not adequately staffed," Siler said, noting that many of the issues with the facility and with contraband are "issues caused by sabotage by inmates."</p>

<p>Attorneys defending the state asked the judge to take anecdotal evidence with a grain of salt, emphasizing that the focus of the case needs to be on whether or not the state has violated the Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners.</p>

<p>"Are any of the issues they're complaining about current and ongoing?" Siler said.</p>

<p>Missing Basics</p>

<p>Warden Frank Shaw, who runs the prison, is sitting in on the trial, and the State plans to call him as a witness and use him to represent one of the named defendants in the case. The lawsuit names Department of Corrections Commissioner Pelicia Hall as well as Gloria Perry, the chief medical officer at MDOC, and Archie Longley, the deputy commissioner of institutions. Shaw is a Management and Training Corporation employee, however. The private company is not a party to the lawsuit, however.</p>

<p>"The state is responsible for whether it's run properly, and that's what at issue," Judge Barbour told the court last week.</p>

<p>Inmates wore black-and-white striped bottoms, chains around their waists jangling and white tops with the words "MDOC INMATE" across the back. They sat right across the room from the State's attorneys and Shaw. Attorneys representing the prisoners plan to have at least two inmates in the courtroom every day throughout the trial. They will call some of the prisoners as witnesses as the trial unfolds.</p>

<p>In the first week, the plaintiffs called nine witnesses, beginning with Eldon Vail, a 35-year veteran corrections officer and operator from Washington state. Vail visited the prison once in 2014 and again in 2016 to evaluate the state of the prison, including safety, security and staffing levels.</p>

<p>"I concluded that it's a very dangerous facility," Vail testified last week, saying that the "basics" were missing.</p>

<p>"There are not a sufficient number of correctional officers, and most of their problems stem from that issue."</p>

<p>Vail reviewed thousands of documents and conducted interviews the plaintiffs' attorneys arranged. He could not interview prison staff, however. MDOC keeps a monitor at the Meridian private prison to report progress and inadequacies at the facility. The weekly and monthly monitor reports confirmed and reinforced his initial conclusion about the facility, he testified.</p>

<p>"You see the same kinds of issues occurring over and over again," he said.</p>

<p>'Logic Is Not Logic'</p>

<p>Staffing concerns and who is responsible for what happens inside prison walls came up repeatedly in testimony. The inmates who worked as porters in 2015 and 2016 cleaning cells testified to seeing fires daily and cleaning up blood after inmates stuck their hands out of their cells' food slots or from cutting themselves.</p>

<p>The facility, like most prisons in the state, has a contraband problem. In March 2017, visiting privileges at the prison were suspended after back-to-back contraband shakedowns revealed that inmates were posting on the Internet, presumably from contraband cell phones.</p>

<p>"MDOC officials searched a specific section of the facility after learning of an inmate posting live on Facebook last weekend," a March 7, 2017, press release from MDOC says.</p>

<p>Attorneys representing the State said that a lot of incidents—from fires to contraband cell phones to self-harm incidents—are the inmates' fault. How far responsibility stretches to the State—and MTC's employees by extension—to keep the facility in order is at the heart of the case.</p>

<p>Eddie Pugh, an inmate who sat in court all last week and testified Friday, described an incident late last year when a new inmate came to his housing unit. Correctional officers expected inmates to choose where the new inmate would live, Pugh said, and when inmates refused to find him a place, they were put on lockdown.</p>

<p>"We were in the dark for three weeks; we were forced into the cells at gunpoint," Pugh said in court last Friday.</p>

<p>Pugh told the court about how some inmates force others out of their cells and have to sleep on the floor of other cells.</p>

<p>"Do the gangs make that decision?" Judge Barbour asked him.</p>

<p>"To truly understand EMCF, you'd have to be there more than one time...," Pugh responded.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't every man have his own bed?" Barbour asked.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," Pugh said. "... Logic is not logic in this place."</p>

<p>The trial continues this week, as attorneys representing inmates have about two-and-a-half more weeks of testimony to offer. Defendants will not take nearly as long, Siler told the court.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Lately Tetrina Blalock has been reconnecting with family members she has not seen in a while. Losing her cousin brought them together. Jackson Police Department officers shot Lee Edward Bonner on Feb. 21, and he died from his injuries two days later at the age of 37, not long before his first grandchild would be born.</p>

<p>Blalock thinks police shot her cousin between eight and 17 times, but she cannot know for sure because of what she calls JPD's "big cloak of secrecy."</p>

<p>JPD has not released the names of the two officers involved in the Bonner shooting, or any of the others involved in at least six other officer-involved shootings since July 2017. Blalock found out with the rest of the people in Jackson City Council chambers at the Feb. 27 meeting that the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations had stepped in to oversee her cousin's case.</p>

<p>Blalock says she is still getting the runaround as far as case numbers, an update of the investigation or a contact person. She has not received any condolences either, she said.</p>

<p>It does not sit well with Blalock that before JPD even released Bonner's name, it had told the public he had allegedly fired his handgun at officers and was a convicted felon. In the officer-involved shooting in January that killed Crystalline Barnes, 21, in her car, JPD sent out an apparent mugshot with the details of the incident. Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba halted this practice with an executive order on Feb. 26.</p>

<p>"I knew Ms. Barnes in passing," Blalock told the Jackson Free Press. "I never thought that after what happened to her, it would turn around and happen to a relative of mine. ... You never think it's going to be that personal."</p>

<p>Blalock recalled a time when she and Bonner were younger, when he protected her from bullies—back when she had more trust in police. Now raising a 14-year-old boy, she tells him to keep his hands on the steering wheel at "10 and two" during a traffic stop to avoid getting shot.</p>

<p>"It shouldn't be that every time you see a police officer, your heart skips a beat, or you hold your breath because you don't know what's going to happen," Blalock told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Blalock does not hate police, and she has not lost hope in Jackson, but she does want change, transparency about JPD's use-of-force policy and the specifics of her cousin's case. Moreover, Blalock does not want another family to go through the same ordeal, and she promises not to rest until she gets clarity and justice.</p>

<p>"To not have answers hurts even more," Blalock said.</p>

<p>Protocols Revealed</p>

<p>Jackson's use-of-force policy dates back to 2004 establishes guidelines and protocol for both deadly and non-deadly responses to arrest or control someone.</p>

<p>The policy, which a city council member provided to the Jackson Free Press, instructs officers to demonstrate "sensitivity, sound judgment, and knowledge of the law," and to only use the amount of force necessary to apprehend someone.</p>

<p>In making a misdemeanor arrest, police are not supposed to employ deadly force, nor is it to be used for anyone unarmed, not resisting or "merely fleeing" from the officer. In a felony arrest, officers may use deadly force if they believe it will save their own lives or that of citizens, or if the suspect is a fleeing felon presenting an "imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm," the policy says.</p>

<p>"'I was in fear for my life ...,'" Blalock said of a common response officers say after shooting civilians. "It's like those seven words magically put a shield around you," Blalock said in the interview.</p>

<p>Police in Jackson are barred from shooting into crowds, firing from a moving vehicle and shooting toward a driver—except if an officer or "innocent citizens'" are in danger. They may not shoot at tires, either. In January, Jackson police officers fired into Barnes' car after saying she drove toward two officers at the scene.</p>

<p>Officers who shoot civilians attend stress counseling and a psychiatric/psychological evaluation, the results of which are sent to the police chief before he allows an officer to return to the line of duty. Interim Chief of Police Anthony Moore tweaked this policy. At a city council meeting on Feb. 27, the chief said officers now will not return until after a grand jury reaches a decision—a process that could take at least a year.</p>

<p>"They want the sensationalization of it to die down," Blalock said in response. "Once your nerves are no longer raw...."</p>

<p>The officer also has to debrief with JPD's Employee Assistance Program counselor within 48 hours of the incident so that he or she can confidentially disclose any moral, ethical or psychological after-effects.</p>

<p>During administrative leave after a shooting of a civilian, JPD's policy directs the officer involved to keep quiet about the incident unless discussing it with his or her attorney, investigators handling the case, "chosen clergy," immediate family members or his or her psychologist.</p>

<p>The officer also has to be available to give department interviews and statements regarding the shooting.</p>

<p>JPD has the wide authority to perform "any other action deemed appropriate" to protect officers, the department or the City, as the use-of-force order reads.</p>

<p>In this case, their actions have involved a code of silence, although the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015 recommended that departments release names of officers quickly to keep the public trust.</p>

<p>Phillip Atiba Goff, co-founder and president of the Center for Policing Equity at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, told the Jackson Free Press that there is no consistent national standard for the protocol on releasing names. However, he also said that releasing video and information can build trust in communities as opposed to a policy of blocking information. Moore has said JPD does not have body cams or the funding for them. </p>

<p>The yin to that yang, as Goff put it, is that police departments also have a duty to protect their officers' identities especially since the nation has seen a spike in targeted, deadly ambushes of law enforcement.</p>

<p>"Finding a balance between officer privacy and officer protections after such a tragic and touchstone incident, and community trust is a difficult one, but those are at least the issues that departments should be balancing," Goff said.</p>

<p>Police Reform Stalling?</p>

<p>There is not an "off-the-shelf" prescription for the best use-of-force policy, Goff said, but he is sure that public outcry after such incidents can help communities achieve the right balance, even as national attention has shifted away. Goff is concerned about policing reform stalling out.</p>

<p>"America is supposed to be an engine for innovation; let's be an engine for innovation in the area of justice," he added. "And that can't happen without a sustained conversation."</p>

<p>Here in Jackson, Blalock is concerned, too, and hopes people see the larger picture. That is why voting matters to her. Jacksonians put Mayor Lumumba in office, who appointed Chief Moore—"the one who doesn't say anything," she said.</p>

<p>"I know the mayor said he's a man of few words, but no, he's mute," Blalock added about the chief.</p>

<p>Blalock does not want others to live with a slain family member constantly in the back of their minds like she does, or the paranoia of what could happen in a routine interaction with an officer. Not long before ending the phone interview with the JFP, Blalock looked in her rearview mirror.</p>

<p>"It's a police officer behind me right now, which is so interesting," she said.</p>

<h2 id="editorsnoterightleftmustworktogetherforcriminalreforms">EDITOR'S NOTE: Right, Left Must Work Together for Criminal Reforms</h2>

<p>by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-14</p>

<p>url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/14/editors-note-right-left-must-work-together-crimina/ </p>

<p>Former felon and criminal attorney John Koufos attracted enough attention while at the New Jersey Reentry Corporation—growing it from one site to nine—that he was hired to bring his "dignity of work" mantra to the Right on Crime effort, where he is now the national director of reentry initiatives. Photo courtesy John Koufos</p>

<p>Donna Ladd</p>

<p>You can spot the New Jersey in John Koufos as soon as he walks up, stares you frenetically in the eye and starts talking about the need for prison reform and re-entry. You can also tell he was pretty slick as a criminal defense attorney back in New Brunswick, N.J., when he defended violent criminals and gang members on murder and racketeering charges. He also did a lot of pro bono cases for poor people of color, but that's not what would gain him notoriety.</p>

<p>In the basement of the Old Capitol Inn on March 5, in an event paid for by the Mississippi branch of Americans for Prosperity—a rather infamous conservative group funded by the also-infamous Koch brothers—Koufos told his prison story, sounding like a stereotypical scumbag attorney like those who defended Barksdale in "The Wire."</p>

<p>Koufos, then 34, was arguing with his girlfriend by text in 2011 while driving his black Lexus from a bar association meeting at a restaurant when he struck Kevin O'Brien, who was walking on the shoulder of the road after getting ice cream, and then fled. O'Brien was seriously injured with head trauma and a ruptured spleen. He was in a coma, but has permanent damage.</p>

<p>Craig Terlizzi, Koufos' 40-year-old assistant, at first took the blame for the accident and was charged in the hit-and-run.</p>

<p>Koufos said in Jackson that he was drunk. In fact, he was drunk much of the time then. And he drove drunk constantly. His mother was 16 when she got pregnent with him in Connecticut, and she was a drug addict.</p>

<p>His father wasn't the best role model, either. He was a bounty hunter and kidnapped someone's girlfriend. He ran to avoid arrest, taking his son with him, moving from state to state until he was caught and went to federal prison.</p>

<p>After pleading guilty, Koufos was sentenced for six years in state prison and was paroled after 17 months under the condition that he would go into rehab (an option many prisoners do not enjoy).</p>

<p>In prison, Koufos says, he was one of the few white faces in his block. He says he learned what most of them needed the most. "Nobody asked me for money, but almost everybody asked me for a job," he told the mostly white, male, conservative audience, including several state legislators.</p>

<p>When Koufos left prison, he was disbarred and decided to back reforms that could help men he met on the inside. "If we can fix the problems, we save tomorrow's victims," he said in Jackson. That means, of course, not just the people who commit the crimes, but those they hurt along the way.</p>

<p>In 2015, Koufos became the executive director of the New Jersey Reentry Corporation, supported by then-Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican.</p>

<p>The idea was to help former prisoners re-enter society ready to work and with services they need, and to connect them with good-paying jobs. What too often happens, especially in a tough-on-crime state like Mississippi, where prisons are packed and re-entry help is limited, is that former prisoners cannot support themselves or their families on the outside. People won't hire them, or they're not ready to keep a job, or there just aren't any they are qualified to hold. Then they can end up re-offending and return to prison, leaving families behind again and continuing the cycle.</p>

<p>They also cost the government money when they're behind bars - which is partly or mostly why re-entry and prison reform have become high priority for conservative groups like those the Koch brothers fund.</p>

<p>Koufos attracted enough attention while at NJRC—growing it from one site to nine—that the Koch crowd hired him to bring his "dignity of work" mantra to its Right on Crime effort, where he is now the national director of reentry initiatives. He was in Jackson, in part, to back House Bill 387 that is still alive at the Mississippi Legislature, essentially the same re-entry reform legislation Gov. Bryant vetoed last year. If passed, the law would ensure that Mississippians are not locked up automatically for their inability to pay court fines and fees; allow inmates convicted of certain crimes to be parole eligible after serving 25 percent of their sentence; and create the Mississippi Sentencing Disparity Task Force.</p>

<p>I'm not a fan of the Koch universe, and I believe much of what they support and fund may cause problems Koufos is trying to convince Mississippi to solve, down to the lack of support for fully funding public schools rather than trying to funnel taxpayer money to select ones. That said, I agreed with about 90 percent of what I heard at the Old Capitol that night—if not that one audience member who didn't think folks should be locked up for white-collar crime. Koufos pointed out, though, that stealing pensions is worse than a young black person stealing $10 at a convenience store.</p>

<p>A full archive of the JFP's "Preventing Violence" series, supported by grants from the Solutions Journalism Network. Photo of Zeakyy Harrington by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>If you're not aware, there is a very strong conservative movement to reform criminal justice, and it is actually more conservative than many of the tough-on-crime policies politicians push to get elected, which then backfire, cost money and cause more crime. They're shortsighted.</p>

<p>We can, and likely will, argue over the specifics, but this kind of policy shift is needed, and these efforts must be bi-partisan. I get sick of divisive politics that seem more about "wins" than getting important policy changes and programs in place.</p>

<p>A likely Democratic candidate for Sen. Thad Cochran's seat called me this week to chat about what he believed in. I noticed that he didn't mention criminal-justice reform, although he does want the "millennial vote," and I asked him about it. He didn't seem opposed to the idea, but I could sense he hadn't thought about it much.</p>

<p>It is time that criminal-justice reform be on every candidate's agenda in Mississippi, regardless of party. The goal should be to lower mass incarceration, especially for drug and victimless crimes—which both parties here voted to begin back in 2014. The dumb tough-on-crime rhetoric must stop. And I sure hate to think that conservatives are finding the courage to have this dialogue in Mississippi more often than those who claim to be progressive.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Legislature should pass HB 387. The bill is a good step toward solving the serious reality that most of the people sent to Mississippi prisons will get out some day and very possibly end up committing worse crime, returning them to institutions funded by the taxpayers' dime.</p>

<p>Oh, and criminal-justice reform is the right thing to do for fallible human beings, whether you're a slick defense attorney from New Jersey or a man who grew up making bad decisions in south Jackson.</p>

<h2 id="criminaljusticereformlawheadedtogovernorsdesk">Criminal Justice Reform Law Headed to Governor's Desk</h2>

<p>Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, asked the Mississippi House to send the re-entry bill to the governor's desk, which it did on Wednesday, March 14. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — If Gov. Phil Bryant signs House Bill 387 into law, Mississippians will not automatically go to prison or jail if they do not pay fines or court fees. The legislation designates a defendant at or below 125 percent of the federal poverty guidelines as poor in the legislation, and judges must take that into consideration when assessing fines and fees.</p>

<p>A judge "shall make an individualized assessment of his or her ability to pay based on the totality of the circumstances including, but not limited to, the defendant's disposable income, financial obligations and liquid assets," the bill says.</p>

<p>Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, took the measure up on Wednesday and asked the House of Representatives to concur with the Senate's changes. The House voted to send the measure to the governor's desk. HB 387 also allows inmates who are not habitual offenders or convicted of sex or violent crimes, or drug trafficking to be eligible for parole after serving 25 percent of their sentence.</p>

<p>A group of clergy came to the capitol last week to vocalize their support for the measure, as well as John Koufos, a former felon who is now the national director of reentry initiatives for the Right on Crime organization, a conservative group supported by the Koch family.</p>

<p>"We must continue to reduce our reliance on incarceration," Rev. C.J. Rhodes said in a press release.</p>

<p>The legislation contains elements that show that legislators intend to continue studying how the State can evaluate and monitor its justice system. HB 387 directs the Joint Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review to conduct a detailed census of juvenile detention centers, county and municipal jails, including offenders' race, gender, offenses and length of sentence. The bill also creates the Mississippi Sentencing Disparity Task Force to look at the disparities in how judges sentence individuals for certain crimes throughout the state.</p>

<p>The measure does give judges an option to deviate from giving a person considered a "habitual offender" the maximum sentence for their third felony, as state law mandates now. A habitual offender " is someone convicted of two felonies previously. Judges can provide an explanation under the proposal to deviate from mandating a maximum sentence.</p>

<p>Gov. Bryant vetoed this measure last year after objecting to some language that could have made certain habitual offenders parole-eligible after serving 25 percent of their sentence. Lawmakers removed that language from the bill this session.</p>

<p>BOSTON (AP) — Civil rights and indigent defense groups asked Massachusetts' highest court Thursday to stop federal agents from arresting immigrants targeted for deportation at courthouses, saying the practice is scaring victims, witnesses and others away from halls of justice.</p>

<p>The petition filed in the Supreme Judicial Court cites immigrants — including a woman who wants to renew a restraining order against her abusive ex-husband — who are too afraid to enter state and local courthouses out of fear of deportation.</p>

<p>The challenge, believed to be the first of its kind in the country, comes as advocates, attorneys and judges have complained about courtroom arrests under President Donald Trump. Courtroom arrests happened under President Barack Obama's administration but attorneys have said the pace appears to have picked up under Trump.</p>

<p>"When people fear our judicial system, that undermines the very fabric of our society and weakens communities," said Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, one of the groups that filed the petition on the immigrants' behalf.</p>

<p>Despite pressure from advocates to declare courthouses "sensitive locations" generally free from immigration enforcement, federal officials in January formalized a policy to send agents to federal, state and local courthouses to make arrests.</p>

<p>Sensitive locations where enforcement is generally avoided include schools, hospitals and places of worship.</p>

<p>ICE says it is targeting convicted criminals, gang members and public safety threats at courthouses as well as immigrants who have been previously deported or ordered to leave. Officials say family, friends and witnesses in court won't be arrested— absent "special circumstances." ICE says it will "generally avoid" immigration enforcement in non-criminal courthouses, like family court.</p>

<p>Trump administration officials have also said that courthouses are a safer place for agents to make arrests since visitors typically have to go through metal detectors.</p>

<p>ICE Spokesman John Mohan said Thursday that the agency does not comment on pending litigation as a matter of policy.</p>

<p>But Mohan said ICE's enforcement action in courthouses is "wholly consistent with longstanding law enforcement practices nationwide." He said jurisdictions' unwillingness to transfer immigrants in local prisons and jails to ICE custody often necessitates courthouse arrests.</p>

<p>Last month, more than 100 New York City public defenders walked out in protest of their clients getting detained by immigration officials, with one lawyer saying ICE agents are "trolling" the courthouse.</p>

<p>And the chief justice of the California Supreme Court last year complained in a letter to top federal officials that ICE agents were "stalking" courthouses to make arrests.</p>

<p>The petition asks the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court to issue a "writ of protection" that would block ICE from arresting people in courthouses for civil immigration violations. The attorneys point to a common law doctrine that protects people who have business before a court from arrest on civil matters.</p>

<p>"It is based on a simple longstanding principle: If people fear arrest on unrelated civil matters, they will be hesitant to go to court, and that will severely undermine the functioning of our judicial system," Wendy Wayne of the Committee for Public Counsel Services, Massachusetts' public defender agency, said in a statement.</p>

<p>Espinoza-Madrigal said the challenge to the courthouse arrests is the first of its kind and will likely spur similar legal actions in other states.</p>

<p>Pratheepan Gulasekaram, an immigration law expert at Santa Clara University, said critics could also argue that the federal government is obstructing justice by scaring witnesses and others away from court.</p>

<p>"It's not clear how these legal theories will play out because many of them present novel issues that courts have yet to wrestle with," he said.</p>

<p>The immigrants cited in the petition include a man from Honduras who was violently attacked and is afraid to appear in court as a witness because he believes his attacker may tell ICE he's living in the U.S. illegally. Another woman from Guatemala wants to go to court to try to force her son's father to pay child support.</p>

<p>A woman from Brazil cited in the suit wants to renew a restraining order against her ex-husband who she said threatened to kill her, but said she is terrified about what would happen to her son if she is deported.</p>

<p>The immigrants are not named in the petition.</p>

<h2 id="blackmalearrestedmadisoncountycasemaygoclassaction">Black, Male, Arrested: Madison County Case May Go Class Action</h2>

<p>by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-16</p>

<p>JACKSON — Ten black residents in Madison County are suing the county and sheriff's department, which stopped, searched or arrested them. They allege that the county's policing strategies disproportionately target them and not white residents—with officers even pre-checking 'black,' 'male,' and 'arrested' on paperwork before knowing who they would apprehend. They also allege that deputies used the word "n-gger" during arrests.</p>

<p>Now, after a half-year of discovery in the case, the ACLU of Mississippi is asking the federal court to certify it as a class-action complaint, meaning their lawsuit would be on behalf of all black residents in Madison County, not just the named plaintiffs.</p>

<p>Attorneys argue that Madison County's policing program violates black residents' rights outlined in the Fourth Amendment, the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The ACLU of Mississippi released data found during discovery at a press conference Wednesday.</p>

<p>Black residents only make up 38 percent of Madison County's population, but 77 percent the Madison County Sheriff's Department made between 2012 and 2017 were black individuals, ACLU data show.</p>

<p>The ACLU of Mississippi brought the lawsuit in May 2017 after a year-long investigation of policing strategies. Public records show that the Madison County sheriff's department targets black communities, the ACLU argues.</p>

<p>"Almost 81 percent of roadblock arrests in Madison County between May and September of 2016 were of black individuals," the complaint, filed last year, says.</p>

<p>The county denies most of the allegations in the complaint, and in its answer outlined Sheriff Randall Tucker's involvement in the community and schools with the goal of improving race relations.</p>

<p>"Upon entry to office, Sheriff Tucker also created a Madison County Community Advisory Group comprised of citizens, business owners, homeowners and others, both Black and White, to meet together and to discuss any and all concerns all citizens have in regard to the activities of the Madison County Sheriff's Department," the defendant's answer filed June 29, 2017, says. "One of the purposes for his creating this Group was to improve race relations in Madison County, which has been one of his main objectives since being elected to office."</p>

<p>Attorneys representing black residents in the county disagree.</p>

<p>"MCSD's own paperwork confirms that it targets Black citizens for arrest," said Joshua Tom, legal director for the ACLU of Mississippi, in a press release. "In the course of our class certification discovery, MCSD officials produced template forms that deputies use in the course of their duties, and on those forms from at least two officers appear pre-populated checkboxes marking 'black,' 'male,' and 'arrested.' The evidence will show discriminatory and unconstitutional policing, and we are looking forward to presenting all of the facts as our case moves forward."</p>

<p>Data from the ACLU of Mississippi show that 76 percent of roadblock arrests in Madison County are black residents. The Madison County Sheriff's Department denied that their roadblocks target certain communities or residents, "Black or White," their answer filed last year says.</p>

<p>"The roadblocks conducted by the Sheriff's Department over the last three years show that they were evenly disbursed throughout Madison County. Further, according to Sheriff's Department policies, each vehicle was stopped and certain information was uniformly obtained during these roadblocks," the defendant's answer says.</p>

<p>"... Any differences in the number of Black individuals and White individuals arrested during these roadblocks is irrelevant to the location of these roadblocks. Instead, these arrests were based on each individual arrested and whether probable cause existed for their arrest or whether a warrant was outstanding for their arrest."</p>

<p>Two plaintiffs in the ACLU's case testified about their experiences of roadblocks in the motion for class certification.</p>

<p>"Plaintiff Bessie Thomas testified that when she tried to speak to an MCSD deputy during a roadblock the deputy cut her off and, referring to the cars behind her, said, 'I've got all these n-ggers off the side of this road,'" the motion says. "Class member Quincy Smith stated that at a traffic stop, he witnessed a white MCSD deputy tell a Black MCSD deputy that he wasn't 'going to help a n-gger out' by letting a driver go without a ticket." (Note: The JFP adds hyphens to certain offensive words out of respect for our readers.)</p>

<p>The plaintiffs have also requested oral argument in the case.</p>

<h2 id="sabotagedeathdangerprivateprisonontrial-1">Sabotage, Death, Danger: Private Prison on Trial</h2>

<p>JACKSON — Terry Beasley remembers a white guy locked in his cell in East Mississippi Correctional Facility one night in 2017, dying. "He was blue," Beasley, an inmate serving a life sentence for a homicide-murder conviction, said in U.S. District Judge William Barbour's courtroom on Friday, March 9.</p>

<p>Some inmates started banging on their windows to try to get the officers' attention, but it took more than an hour for officers to come down to the man's cell from what he could tell from his own cell that night, Beasley said. Eventually, medical staff and the captain came into the zone and recovered the man's body.</p>

<p>"It made me feel scared because I'm a diabetic, and you never know when your sugar (could) drop," said Beasley, who is also asthmatic and diabetic.</p>

<p>Beasley used to clean out cells at the prison in Lauderdale County. On the stand, he described life "in the zone" at one of Mississippi's three private prisons in federal court. He testified that he misses his morning insulin treatment "a lot" whenever the officer in the tower does not let him out of his cell to go get the medication.</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, the National Prison Project of the ACLU and two other law firms brought a class-action lawsuit against the Mississippi Department of Corrections back in 2013 due to conditions at EMCF. After the department refused to settle twice, the case went to trial this month in what is expected to be at least a month-long ordeal.</p>

<p>Operated by the Utah-based Management and Training Corporation since 2012, EMCF is one of three private prisons in the state that MTC operates. MDOC is responsible for the facility and stations a monitor there to track how the facility operates. More than 80 percent of the inmates there are on some type of mental-health medication or treatment protocol.</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that conditions at the prison violate the Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners housed there. Attorneys must prove in court that inmates receive "cruel and unusual punishment" as a result of being housed there.</p>

<p>The State of Mississippi hired two private law firms to defend MDOC in the case. Their position is that the department is not "deliberately indifferent" to the treatment of inmates at the prison. In his opening statement, W. Thomas Siler Jr. encouraged Judge Barbour to go see the facility for himself. He said EMCF has made great strides and changed a lot since MTC took over the facility in 2012.</p>

<p>"We disagree with their conclusion that we're not adequately staffed," Siler said, noting that many of the issues with the facility and with contraband are "issues caused by sabotage by inmates."</p>

<p>Attorneys defending the state asked the judge to take anecdotal evidence with a grain of salt, emphasizing that the focus of the case needs to be on whether or not the state has violated the Eighth Amendment rights of prisoners.</p>

<p>"Are any of the issues they're complaining about current and ongoing?" Siler said.</p>

<p>Missing Basics</p>

<p>Warden Frank Shaw, who runs the prison, is sitting in on the trial, and the State plans to call him as a witness and use him to represent one of the named defendants in the case. The lawsuit names Department of Corrections Commissioner Pelicia Hall as well as Gloria Perry, the chief medical officer at MDOC, and Archie Longley, the deputy commissioner of institutions. Shaw is a Management and Training Corporation employee, however. The private company is not a party to the lawsuit, however.</p>

<p>"The state is responsible for whether it's run properly, and that's what at issue," Judge Barbour told the court last week.</p>

<p>Inmates wore black-and-white striped bottoms, chains around their waists jangling and white tops with the words "MDOC INMATE" across the back. They sat right across the room from the State's attorneys and Shaw. Attorneys representing the prisoners plan to have at least two inmates in the courtroom every day throughout the trial. They will call some of the prisoners as witnesses as the trial unfolds.</p>

<p>In the first week, the plaintiffs called nine witnesses, beginning with Eldon Vail, a 35-year veteran corrections officer and operator from Washington state. Vail visited the prison once in 2014 and again in 2016 to evaluate the state of the prison, including safety, security and staffing levels.</p>

<p>"I concluded that it's a very dangerous facility," Vail testified last week, saying that the "basics" were missing.</p>

<p>"There are not a sufficient number of correctional officers, and most of their problems stem from that issue."</p>

<p>Vail reviewed thousands of documents and conducted interviews the plaintiffs' attorneys arranged. He could not interview prison staff, however. MDOC keeps a monitor at the Meridian private prison to report progress and inadequacies at the facility. The weekly and monthly monitor reports confirmed and reinforced his initial conclusion about the facility, he testified.</p>

<p>"You see the same kinds of issues occurring over and over again," he said.</p>

<p>'Logic Is Not Logic'</p>

<p>Staffing concerns and who is responsible for what happens inside prison walls came up repeatedly in testimony. The inmates who worked as porters in 2015 and 2016 cleaning cells testified to seeing fires daily and cleaning up blood after inmates stuck their hands out of their cells' food slots or from cutting themselves.</p>

<p>The facility, like most prisons in the state, has a contraband problem. In March 2017, visiting privileges at the prison were suspended after back-to-back contraband shakedowns revealed that inmates were posting on the Internet, presumably from contraband cell phones.</p>

<p>"MDOC officials searched a specific section of the facility after learning of an inmate posting live on Facebook last weekend," a March 7, 2017, press release from MDOC says.</p>

<p>Attorneys representing the State said that a lot of incidents—from fires to contraband cell phones to self-harm incidents—are the inmates' fault. How far responsibility stretches to the State—and MTC's employees by extension—to keep the facility in order is at the heart of the case.</p>

<p>Eddie Pugh, an inmate who sat in court all last week and testified Friday, described an incident late last year when a new inmate came to his housing unit. Correctional officers expected inmates to choose where the new inmate would live, Pugh said, and when inmates refused to find him a place, they were put on lockdown.</p>

<p>"We were in the dark for three weeks; we were forced into the cells at gunpoint," Pugh said in court last Friday.</p>

<p>Pugh told the court about how some inmates force others out of their cells and have to sleep on the floor of other cells.</p>

<p>"Do the gangs make that decision?" Judge Barbour asked him.</p>

<p>"To truly understand EMCF, you'd have to be there more than one time...," Pugh responded.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't every man have his own bed?" Barbour asked.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," Pugh said. "... Logic is not logic in this place."</p>

<p>The trial continues this week, as attorneys representing inmates have about two-and-a-half more weeks of testimony to offer. Defendants will not take nearly as long, Siler told the court.</p>

<p>Fair Commission Breaks Ground on New Mississippi Trade Mart</p>

<p>The Mississippi Fair Commission held a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Mississippi Trade Mart on Thursday, March 8. The state Legislature authorized $30 million to build the new Trade Mart and to make improvements to the Mississippi Fairgrounds.</p>

<p>Jackson architectural firm Wier Boerner Allin Architecture designed the new Trade Mart building, and Jackson-based Fountain Construction is the general contractor.</p>

<p>Cindy Hyde-Smith, the state commissioner of agriculture and commerce, announced the building project in November 2017. The new 105,000-square-foot facility will be attached to the east side of the Mississippi Coliseum and replace the current Trade Mart, which was constructed in 1975.</p>

<p>Hyde-Smith said in January 2017 that the building was outmoded, had a flat roof that leaked and would need to be demolished. The current Mississippi Trade Mart will remain in operation until the new facility is completed in late 2019 to early 2020.</p>

<h2 id="notsoftoncrimeclergywantprisonreformstobecomelaw">Not 'Soft on Crime': Clergy Want Prison Reforms to Become Law</h2>

<p>Pastors and advocates gathered at the Mississippi Capitol last week to express support for criminal-justice reform bills still alive this session. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The Mississippi Legislature could approve two re-entry and criminal-justice reform measures this session, which are still alive. House Bill 387 and Senate Bill 2841 would change several parts of state law to help inmates coming out of prison get on their feet financially and avoid going back to prison or jail immediately for not being able to pay fines and fees, among other changes.</p>

<p>Last week, several pastors and faith leaders from around the state and the Jackson metro area gathered at the Capitol to express support for both bills.</p>

<p>"We all need some form of restoration and rehabilitation, so I want to be an advocate for the incarcerated to see them not re-enter, not to go back, but to get what they need: programming while they're incarcerated and also rehabilitation, counseling, health care," Matt McGue, lead pastor of One Church, said.</p>

<p>"So sometimes people can take this advocacy piece as soft on crime, and it's not. We're saying let's be fair to the human dignity of all people, whether they are serving time or not."</p>

<p>Rev. CJ Rhodes, who leads Clergy for Prison Reform, counts almost 12 bills, including the gang bill that died after a House committee did not meet. Rhodes was glad to see the gang bill go down. He said his group is really watching House Bill 387, hoping it will pass.</p>

<p>"Our major push has been more humane treatment when you go into the system, but on the front end, finding less reasons for people to be put in those positions in the first place," Rhodes said at the Capitol last week. He wants local communities, local government agencies and mental-health providers to get to them first before they get involved with the courts or detention centers."</p>

<p>House Bill 387 contains many provisions from the re-entry council's bill that died last year after Gov. Phil Bryant's veto. The bill would ensure that Mississippians are not locked up automatically for their inability to pay court fines and fees; allow inmates convicted of certain crimes to be parole eligible after serving 25 percent of their sentence; and create the Mississippi Sentencing Disparity Task Force.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 2841 contains a few similar measures but adds other reforms, too. The measure would remove the requirement in state law that a person's license be suspended after a controlled substance violation, unless the violation is related to operating a vehicle. Additionally, it would require drug courts to make medication-assisted treatment an option for participants and allow judges to suspend or change sentences after a person has begun serving their time.</p>

<p>A group of pastors with Clergy for Prison Reform sat in on the class-action trial against the Mississippi Department of Corrections brought by inmates at East Mississippi Correctional Facility last week.</p>

<p>Rhodes said the group had also monitored the Walnut Grove lawsuit, before that facility closed. "We want to see justice done in East Mississippi," he said. "... Hopefully this will set a precedent for better treatment."</p>

<p>The deadline for lawmakers to concur with amendments made to both House Bill 387 and Senate Bill 2841 is March 22. The East Mississippi Correctional Facility trial continues this week in federal court.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann says he's not running for his current office again, but won't say what he's running for next.</p>

<p>Hosemann, speaking Monday to the Capitol press corps and Mississippi State University's Stennis Institute of Government, said that after three terms in office, he has met his goals as secretary of state and thinks it's time to move on. The Republican says he still has "great interest" in the state, and voters may see his name on a future ballot.</p>

<p>Hosemann isn't saying whether he'd run for U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran's seat this November, the lieutenant governor's post in 2019, or something else — at least not Monday.</p>

<p>The Clarion Ledger reported last week that Hosemann indicated to schoolchildren that he plans a campaign for lieutenant governor.</p>

<p>Something was not sitting right for James Villes. In 2017, after working on a new recording project for about a year and a half, the hip-hop artist and Jackson native, whom fans know as Alexander FRE$CO, says the music just did not seem to flow right to him.</p>

<p>"When I was coming up with the project, which I was supposed to drop last year, I listened to it a couple times, and I was like, 'This is not working. It's up and down, up and down,'" Villes, 26, says.</p>

<p>He already had about 17 completed songs at the time, some that fell into the more straightforward rap arena and some that highlighted more R&amp;B elements, including his singing vocals.</p>

<p>While Villes felt confident in all the songs, he says that he wanted all of them to have a cohesive feel, both as a collection of recordings and as material for live shows.</p>

<p>"As far as me working on performance sets, I can't be all turned up at the beginning and then slow at the end," he says. "I didn't want it to feel like a rollercoaster. I wanted everybody to be on the same vibe, but I most definitely had to separate some things to make it flow."</p>

<p>That separation ultimately resulted in his latest release, "Neon Nights," an R&amp;B-influenced hip-hop project that he put out on Jan. 26. Villes says that he designed "Neon Nights," which features producers Santalus Beats, The Cratez, J-Louis, Pyrmdplaza, Ric &amp; Thadeus and MJ Nichols, for fans to simply press play and let it ride from start to finish. The music also contains a meta-narrative telling the story of a relationship.</p>

<p>The decision to split the project into separate releases also provided Villes, who began seriously pursuing his music career in 2015, with an opportunity to start fresh, rebrand himself and broaden his creative output as an artist.</p>

<p>Before releasing "Neon Nights," Villes removed his previous releases and music videos as Alexander FRE$CO from online for a clean slate. Going forward, he says that he also plans on alternating between rap and R&amp;B releases while gaining feedback to inform what comes next.</p>

<p>"It's really going to depend on the people, how they react it and what they want to hear," he says, "because at the same time, I'm still performing in different places, so it's whatever people want to hear or whatever the mood calls for. ... I'm not one to try to limit myself because it can be a show over here where they're like, 'Hey, they don't do rappers.' Well, guess what? I also do R&amp;B."</p>

<p>While Villes chose to focus on a new, more atmospheric sound for "Neon Nights," fans will not have to wait long to hear a return to his rap roots.</p>

<p>While preparing for this release, he continued perfecting the unreleased hip-hop songs and writing new material. Knowing that his next rap project is already finished took off some of the pressure off of taking greater risks stylistically on "Neon Nights," he says.</p>

<p>"I just put it all as part of the plan because (a rap project) is going to come soon," he says. "I'm not even worried about it. If this is what's going to go for now, I'm going to have those in the stash. They're going to always be ready so I ain't got to be like, 'Well, I've still got to record this, and I've still got to record that.' It's like, 'No, it's already ready to go!'"</p>

<p>HOUSTON (AP) — The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit Friday accusing the U.S. government of broadly separating immigrant families seeking asylum.</p>

<p>The lawsuit follows action the ACLU took in the case of a Congolese woman and her 7-year-old daughter, who the group said was taken from her mother "screaming and crying" and placed in a Chicago facility. While the woman was released Tuesday from a San Diego detention center, the girl remains in the facility 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) away.</p>

<p>Immigrant advocates say the mother and daughter's case is emblematic of the approach taken by President Donald Trump's administration. The lawsuit, which asks a judge to declare family separation unlawful, says "hundreds of families" have been split by immigration authorities.</p>

<p>The lawsuit also raises the case of a Brazilian woman who the ACLU says was separated from her 14-year-old son after they sought asylum in August. The ACLU says the woman was given a roughly 25-day sentence jail sentence for illegally entering the country and then placed in immigration detention facilities in West Texas, while her son was taken to a Chicago facility.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has not announced a formal policy to hold adult asylum seekers separately from their children. But administration officials have said they are separating parents and children to deter others from trying to enter the U.S.</p>

<p>DHS acting press secretary Tyler Houlton, in a statement last week on the case of the Congolese woman and her daughter, said government officials have to verify that children entering the U.S. are not victims of traffickers and that the adult accompanying them is actually their parent.</p>

<p>In separate court papers filed Wednesday, the U.S. government said it is awaiting the results of DNA testing to confirm the woman is the girl's mother.</p>

<p>"We ask that members of the public and media view advocacy group claims that we are separating women and children for reasons other than to protect the child with the level of skepticism they deserve," Houlton said.</p>

<p>It's hard to determine how often parents and children are placed in separate facilities after they seek asylum, which is granted to people who have a credible fear of persecution if they are forced to return to their home country.</p>

<p>Different government agencies are responsible for holding adults and children. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detains adults accused of immigration violations, while the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services cares for unaccompanied immigrant children.</p>

<p>Immigration advocates criticized President Barack Obama's administration for opening new family detention facilities in Texas and called for parents and children to be released. The two Texas facilities that it opened were found by a federal judge in 2015 to violate a long-standing 1997 settlement requiring children be released or otherwise held in the "least restrictive setting" available.</p>

<p>That settlement set other standards for the detention of children. The Trump administration has called for ending the settlement as part of its demands for changes to immigration laws.</p>

<p>Top administration officials have said they believe the asylum process is overwhelmed and challenged by people making frivolous claims. Advocates have also accused border agents of unlawfully turning away people who are seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

<p>Michelle Brané, director of the migrant rights and justice program for the Women's Refugee Commission, said that through attorneys and social service organizations, she had identified at least 426 immigrant adults and children who had been separated by authorities since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017. Brané said she did not have a comparable figure for Obama's administration.</p>

<p>But Brané said since the new administration began, her office has received far more reports of adults being held in ICE facilities without knowing where their children are.</p>

<p>"A lot of these kids are already afraid because they're fleeing something and they know they're fleeing something," Brané said. "And to have them pulled away, that can be devastating for a parent."</p>

<h2 id="civilrightsmuseumenjoystrumplessgrandopening">Civil Rights Museum Enjoys ‘Trump-less’ Grand Opening</h2>

<p>by: Adam Lynch</p>

<p>The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum held an intentionally "Trump-less" second grand opening presented by the Friends of Mississippi Civil Rights Inc. and the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, with help from the Mississippi-Branch NAACP and the national NAACP. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>It was a scene that should have made President Donald Trump proud. Hundreds of people, including some members of Congress who had unpatriotically boycotted his State of the Union and generally did their best to perfidiously avoid their own president, all seemingly reclaimed their nationalism and stood alongside civil-rights titans. They rose, hands on their chests, eyes forward, proudly reciting the Pledge of Allegiance and singing the national anthem. No smile looked forced, and everybody seemed to be loving their nation that day.</p>

<p>This was the Feb. 24 symposium at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum—an intentionally "Trump-less" second grand opening—presented by the Friends of Mississippi Civil Rights Inc. and the Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus, with help from the Mississippi-Branch NAACP and the national NAACP. Plenty were involved, and none denied Trump's contribution.</p>

<p>"I recall when we got the word that (Gov. Phil Bryant) was going to invite a person from D.C.—who shall not be named—to come and celebrate the opening of this museum, Congressman (Bennie) Thompson and I ... decided that this was not appropriate. This was not supposed to be the time for a photo op. This was not an opportunity for (Trump) to leverage our sacrifice and our history for his political use," said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson.</p>

<p>Bryant hit a nerve with his invite last December after the racially tone-deaf president failed to disavow white nationalists during recent neo-Nazi demonstrations. Trump's dismantling of the civil-rights office at the Department of Justice also doesn't help. Additionally, somehow, the governor had missed the fact that one of the biggest names attending the museum's Dec. 9 opening was the wife of slain civil-rights activist Medgar Evers, whose sacrifice is recognized in museum exhibits. A Ku Klux Klan member shot Myrlie Evers-Williams' husband in the back in 1963 and left him to die in his driveway, surrounded by his wailing family.</p>

<p>Setting the widow up to join a president endorsed by the Klan was a potentially devastating exercise in awkwardness.</p>

<p>Nobody seemed ready to move on from that event. Event speakers, including U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., U.S. Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-La., and civil-rights colossus U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., all seemed to be trying to exorcise Trump from the premises, like a malicious spirit or an unexplained fish smell.</p>

<p>Richmond, for example, did everything in his power to build a box labeled "BACKWARDS" and pile everything Trump-related into it. The administration, he said, was on the wrong end of the very struggle the museum represents and proof that the champions of civil rights' battle was not yet won.</p>

<p>"The fights they fought we unfortunately have to fight again," Richmond said, and then ticked off a multi-point countdown of every backward step the administration staggered through this past year. This included rolling back voting rights, and enabling or supporting vote suppression efforts, and eroding money slated to help police restore trust in minority communities.</p>

<p>Other speakers called out Trump for appointing unqualified and racially biased judges to the bench, and defunding education and affordable-housing efforts. Many scoffed at his claim of African American unemployment as the "lowest rate ever recorded," when black unemployment is still almost double that of whites.</p>

<p>The symposium was undoubtedly a call to arms, but the overall mood was still light and upbeat, and with good reason. On the way in, attendees filed past a throng of optimistic and engaged young visitors, many socially aware and politically driven. This is a group with an interest in the museum and its message that could even help the facility surpass attendance expectations. Before symposium attendees knew it, this new, mobilized generation of laughing youth had piled in around them, crushing them—and they were seemingly in delightful harmony with it all.</p>

<p>Naturally, this contributed to an ambient sense of hope and renewal. Lewis, himself, clearly felt it.</p>

<p>"I wasn't here the last time," said Lewis (who had made a point not to be), "but I have the sense that this time there is something a little more spiritual here, and a little freer, more inclusive."</p>

<h2 id="after7shootingsjpdstillshieldsofficers">After 7 Shootings, JPD Still Shields Officers</h2>

<p>by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-07</p>

<p>Tetrina Blalock came to the Feb. 27 Jackson City Council meeting on behalf of her cousin, Lee Edward Bonner, who died from a Jackson police officer-involved shooting on Feb. 21 in west Jackson. She called the incident “overkill.” Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Lee Edward Bonner, 37, died after a Jackson police officer shot him on Feb. 21 in west Jackson. His family says it was "an overkill," while the City released scant information painting Bonner as the instigator of a shoot-out during a drug investigation gone awry.</p>

<p>"We're not saying he was right. We're not saying he was perfect, but we want justice, and we want to find out what happened by legal standards," Tetrina Blalock, Bonner's cousin, told Jackson City Council on Feb. 27. They also do not know who shot him, yet.</p>

<p>JPD spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said two detectives in plain clothes were conducting a narcotics investigation, and started chasing Bonner and another man they may not have ever found. Police said Bonner displayed a weapon and fired at police, and officers returned fire. Bonner later died of injuries sustained in the altercation.</p>

<p>All the public can know for sure is that the two officers involved in Bonner's shooting are on paid leave pending investigation, which the mayor said the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations will assist. Despite repeated requests, JPD has not released names of officers in the Bonner shooting or any linked to the other six officer-involved shootings since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba took office in July 2017.</p>

<p>Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore, whom the mayor called a man of few words when he took over the position in January, has been true to that description. He has offered little information during press conferences and public meetings as to JPD's use-of-force policy or investigation status, saying only that the department will not release identities of officers who shot civilians in order to protect the cops' safety.</p>

<p>At a government affairs committee meeting at City Hall on Tuesday, Moore brought hard copies of the use-of-force policy. Asked for a copy, a city clerk told the Jackson Free Press to file a public-records request and then a copy would be uploaded to the record system. The JFP had filed the records request the day before, and still did not receive the policy by press time for this article. It is now attached to the story.</p>

<p>Improving policing has been a national conversation since a Ferguson, Mo., police officer killed Michael Brown in August 2014. Citizens and government entities have demanded more transparency from police departments, including the use of body cameras.</p>

<p>However, even when wearing cameras, officers can lie or departments refuse to release the videos, and studies and reports point to their questionable effectiveness. Either way, Moore said JPD cannot afford body cameras.</p>

<p>Vagueness paired with local leaders hinting that Jackson is not one of those cities with the policing issues of yonder mean families like those of Bonner and concerned citizens are left both unaware and potentially unsafe due to the lack of transparency about police shootings.</p>

<p>Policing the Police</p>

<p>Blalock, Bonner's cousin, was one of four people to take the microphone at a crowded Feb. 27 city council meeting to air out concerns about Jackson's policing. She spoke for the Bonner family with clear demands: an independent investigation and autopsy.</p>

<p>"Who is to police the police?" she asked in chambers, alluding to a conundrum many communities face as they try to penetrate many departments' codes of silence and protection for officers.</p>

<p>BuzzFeed News published an investigation titled "Blue Lies Matter" in January 2017 after reviewing 62 incidents of video footage nationally since 2008, with more than 60 percent taking place since 2014. All contradicted an officer's statement in a police report or testimony. The report says that although police are often considered to be the "most reliable narrators in a courtroom," video footage erodes that "bedrock of the justice system" and proves that officers lie "with increasing frequency."</p>

<p>"Cameras prove cops lie, and there are more cameras out in the world today than ever before," BuzzFeed reporter Albert Samaha wrote in the article. "...Officers lie in high-profile cases and little-known cases, and lie by fabrication, omission and exaggeration."</p>

<p>The nation saw broader demand for body cameras following the Michael Brown shooting as an unbiased intermediary to reveal the facts of a case. A 2017 report on body-worn cameras points to the benefit of transparency, but also a potential slippery slope.</p>

<p>"(C)ameras could be used to intensify disproportionate surveillance and enforcement in heavily policed communities of color," The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights &amp; Upturn report reads. "Without carefully crafted policy safeguards in place, there is a real risk that these new devices could become instruments of injustice, rather than tools for accountability."</p>

<p>Many of Jackson's officer-involved cases would be considered "little-known cases" broadly speaking, but even locals know little details about them. Without the funds for body-cam videos, things are even less open here.</p>

<p>Jackson residents have no way of knowing pivotal information about officer-involved shootings in a timely fashion, including which ones have been involved in multiple incidents or even how long these officers have been employed.</p>

<p>Holmes, JPD's spokesman, told the Jackson Free Press last week that there have been five officer-involved shootings since July 2017, but this newspaper has counted seven from JPD's Twitter feed and media reports. The mayor said he has not decided his position on identifying cops involved in shootings, yet.</p>

<p>Meantime, Chief Moore is choosing to hide the identities over public transparency. Both Holmes and Moore confirmed that they will not name officers who shoot civilians until a decision comes back from a grand jury—a process that could take a year or more given backlog in the district attorney's office.</p>

<p>It is a relatively new JPD policy, as Moore told the Council on Feb. 27, that an officer is not to return to duty if a suspect dies during an officer-involved shooting until a grand jury clears them. Prior to Moore, officers were returning to duty pending a psychological investigation, Moore said.</p>

<p>In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice advised police departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident. Some cities release them as soon as 48 hours after the shooting. The DOJ report said that departments can take steps to ensure officer safety during those brief delays.</p>

<p>'Overkill Is Overkill'</p>

<p>At the council podium, Blalock fired off two landmark Supreme Court decisions from the 1980s about use-of-force: Tennessee v. Garner and Graham v. Connor. The former involved an unarmed 15-year-old boy named Edward Garner whom a police officer shot with a hollow-tip bullet in the back of the head to keep him from escaping over a fence.</p>

<p>Garner was a suspect in a nearby house robbery, and he later died. The Supreme Court in 1985 decided that deadly force to prevent an unarmed fleeing felon's escape was unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Dethorne Graham was having an insulin reaction at home in 1984 and a friend took him to the store to get orange juice to fix it. An officer nearby named M.S. Connor thought Graham seemed suspicious for quickly entering and leaving the store, and pulled Graham and his friend over. Graham's foot was broken during the traffic stop among other injuries, although the officer determined that Graham had not committed a crime.</p>

<p>In Graham v. Connor, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 1989 that Graham's claims had to be evaluated under the Fourth Amendment's "objective reasonableness" through an officer on the scene, rather than a generalized "excessive force standard." Lower courts had accepted that good-faith efforts can measure the degree of force.</p>

<p>"If it fell into those two standards, I will accept that—that's the law," Blalock told the city council.</p>

<p>"But, overkill is overkill. I don't know what's on the books as far as what Jackson Police Department is to do (with a suspect), but it wasn't a violent situation. If (the officer) was shooting him, why was (Bonner's) leg not an option?"</p>

<p>In terms of an intermediary use-of-force, Moore told the council that not every officer has a Taser nor are they all Taser-certified, although he did characterize them as an option for when suspects resist or are aggressive. The chief said JPD officers do not use a Taser on suspects that are running away because they could fall.</p>

<p>On Nov. 15, 2017, JPD shot an unidentified black man in the leg when he was running away from police and allegedly pointed a black object at officers, after which they heard a shot.</p>

<p>The mayor has suggested that Jackson does not mirror other instances of officer-involved shootings around the nation. During a press conference on Feb. 26 to announce that JPD will no longer release mugshots of people police shoot, Lumumba acknowledged the complexities communities of color have always had with law enforcement.</p>

<p>With Jackson's majority-black police force, Lumumba said, the national trends around violence do not reflect what happens here—implying that our demographics make our city immune to over-policing as occurred in Ferguson, Mo., for instance.</p>

<p>The information JPD keeps in the shadows might suggest otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="ringingthebellonkidschargedasadults">Ringing the Bell on Kids Charged as Adults</h2>

<p>by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-07</p>

<p>url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/mar/07/ringing-bell-kids-charged-adults/ </p>

<p>Johnnie McDaniels, executive director of the Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center, wants law enforcement and the Hinds County district attorney’s office to stop the “finger pointing.” He says youth charged as adults are sitting in his detention facility for more than 100 days. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Johnnie McDaniels, executive director of Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center, often repeats a Frederick Douglass quote.</p>

<p>"It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men," Douglas wrote in 1855.</p>

<p>"And I'll add women to that," McDaniels said in an interview at the youth detention center on Feb. 28.</p>

<p>McDaniels' job requires him to repair broken children, especially those who have been charged as adults. Many of them sit in his facility for the better part of a year awaiting court dates, convictions and indictments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, those exclusively in the youth system tend to be in and out in a maximum 21-day window, as a consent decree between Hinds County and plaintiffs in a 2011 lawsuit over the conditions at the center mandates. Mississippi law and youth-court rules allow 90 days for the initial delinquency youth-court hearing process after the youth-court prosecutor files the petition in a child's case.</p>

<p>In reality, at least half the kids currently in the Henley-Young detention center are presumably innocent. Their inability to post bail or a judge revoking it at their initial hearing forces them to stay detained until they either find the money or the district attorney's office assigns their case to the docket, which takes time.</p>

<p>Of the 23 juveniles in the facility as of Feb. 28, a dozen are charged as adults—11 boys and one girl. Of that dozen, nine have been at Henley-Young for more than 90 days, and only two of them have been indicted in Hinds County.</p>

<p>Overall, McDaniels has seven juveniles who have been there from 102 to 178 days without an indictment.</p>

<p>Juveniles charged as adults get all the protections and services those under 18 receive—regular school schedules and mental-health counseling—but they suffer all the backlog embedded in the adult system as their childhoods tick away. McDaniels is worried about what long-term stays do to the youth there, but also whether what is happening as a potential result of political pressure, case mismanagement and finger-pointing violates juvenile rights.</p>

<p>"It is constitutionally suspect to me that a 16-year-old or a 14-year-old charged with a serious offense, which they could get life in jail for, will sit un-indicted for 178 days," McDaniels told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Juveniles Get Due Process, Too</p>

<p>A 15-year-old Arizona boy named Gerald "Jerry" Gault helped change the juvenile-justice system in the 1960s. A friend made an obscene call to a woman while at Gault's house, and when the woman filed a complaint, police arrested Jerry without notifying his parents nor mentioning his legal right to an attorney. Gault's mother could not bring him home, and a week later he was sentenced to nearly six years in a juvenile-detention facility.</p>

<p>As of Feb. 28, 2018, nearly half of the juveniles at Henley-Young Juvenile Justice Center are being charged as adults.</p>

<p>Three years later, in May 1967, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8-1 in Gault's favor, establishing juveniles' right to delinquency proceedings under the same due-process rights adults have in criminal trials. That includes the right to counsel, timely notification of charges, the right to appeal and the right to avoid self-incrimination.</p>

<p>"Under our Constitution, the condition of being a boy does not justify a kangaroo court," Justice Abe Fortas wrote in the 1967 opinion.</p>

<p>The justice added that in the "traditional ideas" of juvenile court procedure, authorities should have considered whether it was a prank that parents could have dealt with at home. Fortas also pointed out that Gault received much harsher punishments as a juvenile than he would have if he were 18 at the time—the maximum punishment would have been a fine of $5 to $50, or imprisonment in jail for not more than two months, he wrote.</p>

<p>More than 50 years after that landmark decision, Mississippi juveniles get placed into the adult system at the law-enforcement level when he or she is still presumably innocent—often with media publishing mugshots and asking for "perp" walks for video of the accused children.</p>

<p>Patrick Webb, an associate professor of criminal justice at St. Augustine's University, a historically black college in Raleigh, N.C., has done research on the relationship between media coverage and juvenile proceedings.</p>

<p>"Exposing children to 'hey, look this is what can happen to you, look at this perp walk, look at this kid behind these bars,' it may frighten him and it may expose him, but it's not going to change his thinking," Webb said in an November 2017 interview. "It will only frighten him and shock him and entertain him and leave an impression, but that impression will not be permanent, and it will not lead to a change of behavior."</p>

<p>In other jurisdictions in the U.S., youth under 18 go before a youth-court judge who decides on the level of the charges and if the juvenile at hand will be treated as an adult before being subjected to the potential damage of a media circus.</p>

<p>McDaniels says Mississippi should adopt the latter practice, but for now, at least, he wants law enforcement and the district attorney's office to take ownership over moving juvenile cases through the system swiftly.</p>

<p>As it currently goes, McDaniels says the district attorney's office blames the initial investigation the police do for delays—often telling McDaniels they have to re-investigate. When he speaks to law enforcement officers, they blame backlog in the district attorney's office.</p>

<p>"It just kind of depends on who I'm talking to in terms of what answer I get," McDaniels said, "which is frustrating in a sense that someone should say at that point the court should be involved in this process."</p>

<p>Regardless of fault, juveniles sit awaiting justice in cases that might not have necessary evidence to move their charges forward. Many young people are detained after their bond hearings, so even if a judge decides to kick their cases into youth court, they have to wait to get onto the docket to do so. The longer the juveniles are away from their community, schools and family, the more frustrated they get, McDaniels said.</p>

<p>'That's Not Fair'</p>

<p>Having spent a decade as a city prosecutor, McDaniels said he often puts his "old attorney hat on" to explain where kids charged as adults are in the process, especially when they do not understand why they have not gotten bond or why their stint is so long this time versus other times they may have been to the facility.</p>

<p>"But for the most part ... some of them understand the seriousness of it, and that (they) may leave here, and the next stop may be Parchman," McDaniels said of the notorious prison in the Mississippi Delta.</p>

<p>McDaniels said other kids tell him: "I'm not guilty of what they're accusing me of, but I've been in here for 170 days. Mr. McDaniels, that's not fair."</p>

<p>McDaniels is particularly sensitive to how juveniles are treated in the media before they get there.</p>

<p>On Feb. 26, the mayor issued an executive order banning the police from sending out mugshots of civilians that officers shoot, and said at the press conference that he would also have JPD stop giving out mugshots of juveniles, even if they're being charged as adults.</p>

<p>Before that, JPD sent out and tweeted mugshots of kids as young as 13—the minimum age one can be charged as an adult in this state.</p>

<p>Weeks ago, JPD disseminated one of a 14-year-old girl charged with capital murder and already in custody.</p>

<p>In a 2008 study, Webb presented a theory that suggested public embarrassment from the media and other tactics could teach children to abstain from criminal behavior to avoid public embarrassment to themselves and their families and to keep from jeopardizing their futures.</p>

<p>But, Webb says, these fear-backed, short-term measures like "Scared Straight" tough talks and media "dog-and-pony" shows only create temporary behavior changes. He says the best way to discourage anti-social behavior is not to intimidate or shame the person.</p>

<p>Backed by research, McDaniels fears that some of the same juveniles "castigated" on local TV news may have difficulties going back into school, classroom settings and the community because of the coverage, even if nearly a year passes before they are indicted.</p>

<p>"There's always political pressure on a case that has been highlighted in the news, and the community has a bunch of perspective on what they think has occurred, but the facts may not be what they suggest," McDaniels said.</p>

<p>McDaniels wants law enforcement and the Hinds County district attorney's office to stop the "finger pointing" at each other and work together for a solution.</p>

<p>"That's not a mean-spirited criticism of any of the other parties that are involved in this process, whether it's law enforcement, district attorney's office, or whomever," McDaniels said in the interview.</p>

<p>"But, I think we have to ring the bell at this point and say that the current system is simply not working, and we've got to do some things different in Hinds County."</p>

<h2 id="mayorrefutesethicscomplaintclaimingjpddestroysimmigrationrecords">Mayor Refutes Ethics Complaint Claiming JPD Destroys Immigration Records</h2>

<p>by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>JACKSON — In one of his more assertive and direct public statements, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba refuted an ethics complaint from a branch of a local conservative think tank accusing the City of Jackson of destroying immigration records called detainers. But he left it unclear whether or not they receive those documents in the first place.</p>

<p>On Monday, Shadrack White, director of the Mississippi Justice Institute, filed a public-records complaint with the Mississippi Ethics Commission after asking for all records concerning any Jackson Police Department detainer or immigration hold requests back to January 2014. In a Jan. 31 letter responding to the records request, JPD said it neither keeps nor maintains such records. White and the MJI took that to mean the JPD "simply throws requests to hold illegal immigrants in the garbage."</p>

<p>Immigration Customs and Enforcement, called ICE, sends detainers to local law enforcement when it arrests someone believed to be in the country without proper documentation so the agency can take custody of detailed immigrants when released. White had requested copies of the detainers the City of Jackson had received, arguing that if the City no longer has them, it must have destroyed them.</p>

<p>"This is a meritless, baseless, senseless, waste of time, and this is an out-and-out lie," Lumumba said at the press conference. "It is alternative facts, if you will. This administration has not destroyed anything."</p>

<p>Lumumba likened the accusations to what would happen if he tried to withdraw a million dollars from his bank account. "Well, I will never get the million dollars out of my account because I don't have a million dollars, right?" the mayor said. "I can't provide what we don't have; I can't provide what we don't take in. I can't destroy what we don't collect. So that is why it is a baseless accusation, and it is political in nature."</p>

<p>The mayor, however, did not make it clear where the "million dollars"—in this case, the detainers—are at this time.</p>

<p>White asked the Mississippi Ethics Commission to require the JPD to release records about immigration detainers requested in January, call witnesses from the JPD to testify about departmental policies for ICE detainers, require any documents that speak to said policy, and to grant an oral argument for MJI's request. He told reporters after the mayor spoke that this complaint is about preserving government transparency and public safety, especially after the U.S Department of Justice under President Donald Trump's tenure named Jackson as one of the sanctuary cities around the country.</p>

<p>"The goal of getting the information is to make sure every citizen in Jackson knows just how bad this problem is, just how many people have been arrested by JPD and then released back onto the streets without being turned over to ICE," White told reporters. He added that every taxpayer in Jackson deserves to know what's going on, and then they can pressure on the City to fix the problem.</p>

<p>"Sunshine is a really good disinfectant in these places, and that's what we need, we need sunshine," White said.</p>

<p>In late January, the Department of Justice sent a letter to Jackson officials asking for all documents, instructions, and guidance to law enforcement employees pertaining to how they "may or may not" communicate with ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>Lumumba said in January that documents showing its communication with ICE do not exist.</p>

<p>Under a 2010 city ordinance that cements anti-profiling protections, Jackson police officers cannot ask about a person's immigration status unless it is in the course of a criminal investigation or necessary to assist federal law enforcement. The Justice Department took issue with this aspect of city code.</p>

<p>"Racial profiling is patently illegal," Lumumba told reporters in January. "... Furthermore, racial profiling is ineffective. It alienates communities from law enforcement, disrupts community policing efforts, and causes law enforcement to forfeit credibility and trust among the people they are sworn to protect and serve."</p>

<p>White told reporters Monday the end goal is for the City to say exactly what it does with the ICE detainers and to start maintaining them, and if the City wants to change its sanctuary-city policy, that would also be a good thing.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Rats crawling out of toilets. Cells with no lights. Inmates dying in solitary confinement with zip ties around their wrists and ankles. This is a sample of the laundry list of deficiencies the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU National Prison Project outlined in a lawsuit filed in 2013 against the Mississippi Department of Corrections.</p>

<p>Inmates housed at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility alleged squalor conditions, solitary confinement practices, lack of medical and mental health care, and an overall unsafe environment. Five years later, the case goes to trial before U.S. District Judge William Barbour today.</p>

<p>Jody Owens, the managing attorney at SPLC who was in the facility last week, describes EMCF as in "consistent chaos." He said four inmates have died in the last two months alone.</p>

<p>"Our investigations support that two have been overdoses, one has been an individual who could not get the help he needed as he choked on his lunch," Owens told reporters last week. "That has been the history of East Mississippi from then to now—a lack of security, safety and staff."</p>

<p>EMCF is one of three state private prisons that the Utah-based Management and Training Corporation operates, mostly in southern states. Of the 1,200 inmates there, the facility primarily houses inmates with mental-health issues or special medical needs. The lawsuit charges that MDOC has not done its part to ensure that contractors are keeping prisoners safe and healthy.</p>

<p>SPLC and the ACLU began their investigation of the facility in 2011 and sent then-MDOC Commissioner Chris Epps a letter demanding changes to the facility. MDOC declined, and Owens said MDOC has refused to settle the case twice during the last five years of litigation.</p>

<p>MDOC for its part has denied the majority of allegations in the lawsuit and has asked the judge to throw out the case. The attorney general's office has hired private attorneys to help defend the state in the case. MTC manages the facility in Meridian, and Centurion of Mississippi, partnership between MHM Services and Centene, provides medical care for prisoners there (as well as the rest of the state's prison system) with headquarters in St. Louis, Mo., the Mississippi Secretary of State's website shows. MHM Services is not registered with the secretary of state, but St. Louis-based Centene Management Company registered in Mississippi as an LLC in 2011.</p>

<p>MTC took over the facility in July 2012, after attorneys began their investigation. The corporation maintains that conditions at EMCF have improved. In an emailed statement, which avoids specifics of the case, MTC emphasized its adequate staffing levels, new security measures (like a body scanner) and a GED program.</p>

<p>"The facility is safe, secure, clean, and well run. From the warden on down, our staff are trained to treat the men in our care with dignity and respect. Our mission is to help these men make choices in prison and after they're released that will lead to a new and successful life in society," the statement said.</p>

<p>"The facility is accredited by the American Correctional Association and the Correctional Education Association. It's also 100% compliant with the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act, which was created to further protect the rights of inmates," the statement continued.</p>

<p>Centurion is the third medical-provider contractor at the facility since the litigation began. MDOC is also on its third commissioner since the litigation began; the initial complaint names former Commissioner Chris Epps, who is serving time in federal prison now after he was convicted of a bribery scheme.</p>

<p>Erin Monju, an attorney at Covington &amp; Burling representing the plaintiffs, said the facility still does not have a staff psychiatrist.</p>

<p>"It is also the Mississippi Department of Correction's obligation to ensure that their contractors abide by the contract paid for with Mississippi tax dollars, but across these three contractors, (the department) has failed to ensure prisoners are receiving adequate health care, and they have failed to hold these contractors to their obligation," Monju told reporters last week.</p>

<p>Taxpayers foot the bill for private prisons, as well as for the contractors operating within them. In the 1990s, lawmakers took out bonds to pay for private prisons, and that debt service will not be paid off until fiscal-year 2028. The state is currently paying more than $6 million in debt service this year for EMCF. Attorneys said the contract with Centurion is valued at more than $50 million in taxpayer money.</p>

<p>Attorneys representing the inmates expect the trial, which Judge Barbour will decide and not a jury, to go on for a few weeks. They plan to call experts, inmates and possibly former prison staff members as witnesses during the trial. Just how much conditions have improved—or not—will likely become clear during the trial as well as how much MDOC has worked to hold private contractors accountable for changing the environment, health and practices in the facility.</p>

<p>Correction: A previous version of this story said former MDOC Commissioner Chris Epps was serving time in MDOC. He is not. He is serving time in federal prison. We apologize for the error. </p>

<h2 id="theracistrootsofdisenfranchisingvoters">The Racist Roots of Disenfranchising Voters</h2>

<p>Corey Wiggins, the executive director of the Mississippi NAACP, called on lawmakers to work to restore voting rights for the more than 218,000 Mississippians who are disenfranchised, at a press conference at the Capitol this session. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Anthony Witherspoon calls it "divine intervention." Others might call it luck. The second-term mayor of Magnolia, Miss., learned quickly how state laws can disenfranchise and significantly alter a person's life, all depending on what crimes they have committed.</p>

<p>Witherspoon, who is black, was convicted of manslaughter in 1992 after shooting a man "in self-defense" after having six or seven rounds fired at him, he says today. The Mississippi Supreme Court rejected two lower court rulings that he was guilty of murder, and ultimately a jury convicted him of manslaughter, and he drew a 20-year prison sentence. Witherspoon stayed out of prison for four years on an appeal bond and then served six years in state prison.</p>

<p>As soon as he got to prison in 1996, Witherspoon began to research his voting rights, and found that manslaughter is not one of the 22 disenfranchising crimes in Mississippi.</p>

<p>"[I] discovered that ... there were only 10 felonies that disenfranchised someone from their voting rights if convicted of a felony," Witherspoon recalled. "It said murder, but it didn't say my charge, which was manslaughter. It said rape but not aggravated assault."</p>

<p>Witherspoon wrote a letter to the attorney general asking for clarification. The answer was clear: He still had his right to vote. He wrote his circuit clerk and asked for an absentee ballot to be sent to prison. Witherspoon went on to register several other inmates who were eligible to vote as well. Any Mississippian, who is a U.S. citizen and has never been convicted of voter fraud or one of the 22 disenfranchising crimes can register to vote and has the right to vote, including men and women in prison.</p>

<p>"I actually started registering inmates to vote while in prison, and we continued that campaign once I got out of prison," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Witherspoon worked with the ACLU of Mississippi and the NAACP to help educate Mississippians about the specific list of disenfranchising crimes. When Witherspoon got out of prison in 2002, voter registration forms still no disclaimers about disenfranchising crimes, so he worked with the ACLU on an education campaign in order to register more formally incarcerated Mississippians to vote.</p>

<p>One of the disenfranchising crimes in the 1890 Mississippi Constitution is "theft," which is not currently defined in state law. In 2012, Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann published a list of 22 disenfranchising crimes, based on a 2009 attorney general's opinion.</p>

<p>"Theft" is still on the list, as well as receiving stolen property, timber larceny, unlawful taking of motor vehicle, carjacking and felony shoplifting. Arson, armed robbery, bigamy, murder and robbery also make the list.</p>

<p>Witherspoon's manslaughter conviction also meant he could hold public office, despite not being allowed to get his violent offense expunged. In November 1992, the Legislature had added two exceptions to the law that kept anyone convicted of a felony from running for office: manslaughter and tax violations.</p>

<p>Witherspoon was convicted of manslaughter in November 1992.</p>

<p>"I guarantee that this little country boy did not have that kind of pull with the Legislature, but that's what happened," Witherspoon said.</p>

<p>In the Courtroom</p>

<p>The ACLU of Mississippi attempted to sue the state for its list of disenfranchising crimes when Witherspoon worked there—but did not succeed.</p>

<p>Now, the Mississippi Center for Justice is challenging this list in federal court. Changing the list of disenfranchising crimes could change voter turnout for several counties across the state.</p>

<p>Mississippi is one of 12 states with disenfranchisement laws that can affect people for life. The list of 22 disenfranchising crimes means an estimated 218,181 people in the state are unable to vote, a new study from the Sentencing Project, One Voice and the Mississippi NAACP, shows. In an analysis of 2016 data, researchers found that 93 percent of those disenfranchised on Mississippi's list live in the community—not behind bars.</p>

<p>"Mississippi has one of the most extreme policies. It's one of the states that disenfranchises people for life unless there's intervention either from the governor or from this onerous process where people have to file individual suffrage bills," Nicole Porter with the Sentencing Project told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Mississippians looking to restore their voting rights must petition the governor for a pardon or executive order or ask their district's lawmakers to introduce a suffrage bill on their behalf, a process that is far from a guarantee. Gov. Phil Bryant has not restored anyone's right to vote during either of his terms and has not signed a single suffrage bill. Suffrage bills, brought by lawmakers on behalf of their constituents, become effective with two-thirds of the Legislature's approval, with or without his signature.</p>

<p>Since 2007, 45 suffrage bills have passed and 83 failed, the Sentencing Project report shows. During Bryant's first and recent term, lawmakers passed 15 suffrage bills.</p>

<p>Some states have automatic voter-rights restoration for people as soon as they leave prison or jail. Maryland just expanded voting rights to people in the community on probation or parole and increased its voter rolls by an estimated 40,000 residents, Porter said. In Mississippi, a similar measure could allow more than 200,000 residents the right to vote again, based on 2016 numbers.</p>

<p>A measure to study disenfranchisement passed the House this year with bipartisan support, and on Monday, Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, passed the bill through the Senate Judiciary B Committee, noting constitutional issues with the list of disenfranchising crimes.</p>

<p>Senate leadership referred House Bill 774to Judiciary B and the Senate Rules Committee. By press time both committees passed the measure, so the full Senate will vote on it in the coming week. Similar measures have died in the Senate in previous years.</p>

<p>A Racist List of Crimes?</p>

<p>Felony disenfranchisement still disproportionately affects African Americans in the state. At a press conference this month, the Mississippi NAACP called on lawmakers to change the state's stringent disenfranchising laws.</p>

<p>"Mississippi's restrictive suffrage laws do not go far enough in providing a meaningful opportunity for enfranchisement," Corey Wiggins, executive director of the Mississippi NAACP, said in a press release.</p>

<p>"To deny people the fundamental right to vote is at odds with ample evidence showing the expansion of voting rights not only leads to safer communities but has widespread public support."</p>

<p>Nearly 16 percent of the black electorate in the state are disenfranchised, the Sentencing Project report found, using 2016 numbers. Disenfranchising crimes were initially targeted along racial lines. In the 15 years following the Civil War, states ramped up disenfranchising crimes, immediately following black men gaining their right to vote.</p>

<p>"The list of crimes that's in our state Constitution was adopted in 1890 because it was thought that black people were more likely than white people to commit these crimes, and this was one of a number of provisions that the constitution of 1890 (had) seeking to make it more difficult for black people to exercise their voting rights," Bryan said Monday.</p>

<p>Just as Jim Crow laws would do well into the 1960s, the point of the disenfranchisement law was to keep black people from voting.</p>

<p>"The motivation for enacting broad felony disenfranchisement laws in this context was clear: preventing newly enfranchised black citizens from exercising political power," Erin Kelley writes in a 2017 Brennan Center report.</p>

<p>Mississippi's disenfranchisement law was used as a model for other states, when it was adopted in the state's 1890 Constitution, and even the state Supreme Court acknowledged the racist ties to disenfranchisement, while upholding the list as constitutional six years later.</p>

<p>"Restrained by the federal constitution from discriminating against the negro race, the convention discriminated against its characteristics and the offenses to which its weaker member were prone. ... Burglary, theft, arson, and obtaining money under false pretenses were declared to be disqualifications [from voting], while robbery and murders, and other crimes in which violence was the principal ingredient, were not," the report states.</p>

<p>Bryan, who is white, said that Alabama had a similar provision in its constitution that the U.S. Supreme Court deemed unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Witherspoon said that during his work with the ACLU of Mississippi he learned that public education was necessary to inform not only inmates but also circuit clerks that going to jail or prison alone is not grounds for losing the right to vote. Today, the disenfranchising crimes are listed on voter-registration forms and online.</p>

<p>"Now it's 22 (disenfranchising crimes). So you know, now it's 12 that have been applied without an act from the Legislature. I don't understand how you can amend the Constitution outside a legislative act, but that's where we are," Witherspoon said.</p>

<h2 id="editorsnotemoveonfromantiquatedanduselessgangbill">EDITOR'S NOTE: Move On from ‘Antiquated and Useless’ Gang Bill</h2>

<p>David Kennedy, a John Jay College criminal-justice professor and director of the National Network for Safe Communities, helped develop and implement Operation Ceasefire in cities across the country to counter violence. He says that efforts to police gangs, such as in Mississippi's failed gang bill, are “antiquated and useless.” Instead, police and communities must focus on the people who commit violence, he says.

<p>Donna Ladd</p>

<p>Whew, that nightmare is over. A very bad "gang bill" has died in the Legislature for the second year in a row. This death occurred after the Senate passed its bill to criminalize gang association and give expanded sentences to associates of gangs or crews or cliques for up to 15 years. The House version had already died, leaving the Senate version as the one to live or die.</p>

<p>The bill died after a year of The Clarion-Ledger carrying heavy water for the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators, a wild-west-esque cop group that wants to round up the gangsters, old-school style. All last year, their reporter of "crime/breaking/mayhem" (per Twitter) kept quoting the bill's supporters proclaiming "a gang problem!" and reported MAGI members saying they wanted to lock up people simply for being in a gang—guilt by association. A similar gang bill died last year after its sponsor used the same arguments for it.</p>

<p>That reporter seldom interviews anyone about the gang bill other than law enforcement who want to send more young people to gang-infested prisons where they're likely to come out worse criminals. She doesn't talk to former gang members, which isn't hard at all to do, not to give up my trade secrets. And I have never seen her hunt down an actual criminologist, just taking every MAGI word as gospel.</p>

<p>MAGI even has a "Never Back Down" logo of a skull with dripping blood (or maybe it's milk?) over an apparent AR-15. The logo brings the slogan to mind of the now-disbanded NYPD Street Crimes Unit that shot unarmed Amadou Diallo 41 times in his yard: "We own the night." The SCU even had a Hemingway quote printed on their shirts: "Certainly there is no hunting of man like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and liked it, never really care for anything else thereafter."</p>

<p>A proposed gang bill was not based on current evidence-based violence research. It died in the Legislature.</p>

<p>The problem with MAGI's gang bill is that it was circular, leaving no confidence that the people behind it were trying to seek good information and evidence-based strategy. They surveyed cops at a November 2017 convention (which that reporter attended) and sent the lists of suspected gangs to the local Homeland Security's "fusion center," which kicked MAGI back a report in December using their data to back the gang bill in January. Then Sen. Brice Wiggins, the bill's sponsor (whom the reporter had quoted all year), took to the floor and argued for it because, you know, gangs are bad. See Spot run.</p>

<p>Then, after it came out that the fusion report MAGI provided information to had doubled the number of gang members in Mississippi prisons, the reporter managed to distill the opposition to the bill into "civil-rights groups" and "the Black Caucus."</p>

<p>No, Ledger. The strongest opposition to any such gang bill, and police obsessing about gangs in general, actually comes from crime and violence experts who work daily to end violent crime and use both the research and the evidence-based practices the whole country of violence experts knows about in 2018. It's hard to type the words "gang violence" into a search engine and not be inundated with reasons the MAGI gang bill didn't make a lick of sense.</p>

<p>And not because the law might be used to profile African Americans and Hispanics, send them to prison longer if you can attach them to one or another gang, and then take away their voting rights forever. Yes, that is a real danger in today's world. We all know it, especially the folks who are salivating to disenfranchise black voters. We can stipulate this danger even without The Clarion-Ledger reporter's transparent asides about the Black Caucus being the big opponent of the gang bill.</p>

<p>The other, and arguably larger reason, to oppose the gang bill is that it would not do what such a law promises to do: reduce violence and serious crime over time. The crime experts would tell that reporter repeatedly should she bother to ask that policing gang activity is dumb and counter-productive. You should attack the violence and the people committing it, which most of them predict is 10 percent or less of the people who claim some sort of gang association, which is often a way of belonging to something bigger than yourself. (Which contains hints, by the way, of other ways to prevent violence and crime.)</p>

<p>I was just in New York City for 10 days to attend a crime-reporting symposium at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice where I have an investigative reporting fellowship (in conjunction with the Quattrone Center at Penn Law). The purpose is to give reporters tools to help know what and who to ask about crime and violence, and they connected us with everyone from the district attorneys of Brooklyn, N.Y., and Houston, Texas, to opioid experts (and a former addict) in Ohio, to the top criminologists and crime researchers in the country, to Koch Industries reps for prison and re-entry reform.</p>

<p>We'll be reporting on what I learned there over time, but suffice it to say that not one of them expressed the need to police and punish gang association and pile on additional sentences. The opposite, in fact. They know such "general" efforts are counter-productive and that most cities have moved to smarter, "focused" strategies.</p>

<p>One of the best-known strategies is headed by David Kennedy, a John Jay professor of criminal justice and the director of the National Network for Safe Communities, which helps set up and run programs often called "Operation Ceasefire" in cities around the country; some of their most recent work is in Birmingham, Ala. In fact, one of the primary strategies the 2016 BOTEC Analysis study of Jackson gang crime—funded by the Legislature and ignored by the Ledger—embraced was what is often called "the Kennedy model," which grew out of the successful Boston Gun Project of the 1990s, which he helped establish.</p>

<p>Put simply, Kennedy knows gang and gun violence, but doesn't use the word "gang" much. "'Gang' is an antiquated and useless concept," he told me in his office last week. He criticized the "world of gang enforcement" that fixates on policing gangs, instead of being smart and targeting the small percentage that commit the violence.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more solutions reporting on this front. If the gang bill stays dead as it should, we need to replace it with efforts that are more intelligent and evidence-based and not as likely to increase recidivism and create more violent gang members.</p>

<p>To be part of a local dialogue on such causes and solutions, join the Youth Media Project Thursday night, March 1, at Wingfield High School from 6 to 8 p.m., and again on Thursday, March 22, from 6 to 8 p.m. at Jim Hill High School.

<h2 id="editorialjpdidentifycopswhoshootcivilians">EDITORIAL: JPD, Identify Cops Who Shoot Civilians</h2>

<p>Outside agencies should investigate if an officer used excessive force, and JPD must not withhold names, how long these officers have been with the force or if they have a record of using excessive force. Photo by</p>

<p>Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Lumumba touted his "progressive agenda" at a Feb. 27 press conference before signing an executive order to stop the release of mugshots of people the Jackson Police Department shoots.</p>

<p>Lumumba said JPD will stop releasing mugshots of juveniles, including those arrested as adults, a dangerous practice that can increase violence later and scar falsely accused kids. Even though his executive order did not include the juvenile mugshots, Lumumba said the ban would include those charged as adults, which is a major policy shift.</p>

<p>As recently as Feb. 16, the JPD sent reporters a mugshot of a 14-year-old girl charged with murder who was in custody when her photo went out.</p>

<p>This order does not address the glaring need for JPD to release names of officers who use excessive and/or fatal force on civilians—the progressive needle does not move without this transparent practice, which departments around the country embrace often within 48 or 72 hours of an incident.</p>

<p>Lumumba has been laissez-faire on the matter, saying he does not have a stance on releasing the names either way. After seven officer-involved shootings since Lumumba took office in July 2017, JPD has identified none of the shooters. Lumumba says his executive order should be an example for other municipalities and states to follow. But this is inconsistent.</p>

<p>The mayor introduced Interim Chief Anthony Moore as someone "familiar with the trends around the nation, as he teaches criminal justice. The chief said he would not identify officers who have shot civilians. That refusal ignores the U.S. Department of Justice's 2015 advisement for departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident.</p>

<p>Moore said it is about officers' safety, even as all departments face the same issue. The DOJ's report said police could take a couple of days extra if needed to ensure an officer was protected, but not several weeks or months. Moore also said it was a personnel issue, to which we heard someone respond, "An officer shooting is not an HR issue."</p>

<p>Now, JPD investigates officer-involved shootings internally and keeps the names private indefinitely if they ever become public knowledge. It feels like a cover-up even if it is not meant to be one. Outside agencies should investigate if an officer used excessive force, and JPD must not withhold names, how long these officers have been with the force or if they have a record of using excessive force.</p>

<p>The mayor's executive order loosely says that communities of color have always had complex relationships with law enforcement, but that national trends around violence and police-involved shootings do not necessarily reflect reality in Jackson with its majority-black police force.</p>

<p>Let us be clear: Race does not give Jackson license to withhold vital information from the public. Doing so will only increase distrust and perhaps bad policing, regardless of the City's demographics. The City must release the names immediately.</p>

<h2 id="opinionpoliceviolenceisnotdjvu">OPINION: Police Violence is Not Déjà Vu</h2>

<p>date: 2018-02-28</p>

<p>On Feb. 21, 2018, a black male whom the Jackson Police Department or media have yet to identify was the latest victim of police violence since Nov. 15, 2017. Since then, local media outlets have reported eight officer-involved shootings. Photo courtesy Flickr/Diversey</p>

<p>In Jackson, police violence is not deja vu; it is real and systemic.</p>

<p>On Feb. 21, 2018, a black male whom the Jackson Police Department or media have yet to identify was the latest victim of police violence since Nov. 15, 2017. Since then, local media outlets have reported seven officer-involved shootings. (See comment below this article.)</p>

<p>Although WLBT reported that the most recent one was the second officer-involved shooting in 2018, there actually have been three of these this year. JPD shot at Reginald Harper on Jan. 4, 2018. Fortunately, he was not maimed or killed. JPD officers fired a fusillade of bullets at Crystaline Barnes and killed her on Jan. 27, 2018. The most recent incident of police violence indicated that the man officers shot is in critical condition and is fighting for his life.</p>

<p>JPD told WLBT that officers were in the area investigating alleged drug activity when they approached two men, who ran from them. At some point, one of them allegedly produced a gun and fired at officers, which resulted in him being shot.</p>

<p>The officers were not in uniform. There is no clear indication that they identified themselves. No drugs were found at the scene. It appears that JPD officers were wrong about the victim being a drug dealer, which means they had no legal right to approach the men.</p>

<p>Standing on the corner does not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion that warrants an officer approaching a person to question them. It certainly does not mean that a person is a drug dealer.</p>

<p>Some will say, "If he was not doing anything wrong, why did he run?" The man's fleeing could be an indication that he was afraid. When the persons chasing him did not abandon their chase, he might have felt he had to defend himself.</p>

<p>Even if the officers did identify themselves, in a case where a gun-possession conviction of a black male was overturned, the Massachusetts Supreme Court held: "We do not eliminate flight as a factor in the reasonable suspicion analysis whenever a black male is the subject of an investigatory stop. However, in such circumstances, flight is not necessarily probative of a suspect's state of mind or consciousness of guilt. Rather, the finding that black males are disproportionately and repeatedly targeted for FIO (Field Interrogation and Observation) encounters suggests a reason for flight totally unrelated to consciousness of guilt."</p>

<p>Basically, the Massachusetts Supreme Court overturned the man's conviction because, given how much police stop and harass black men, the court found that the man had every reason to run, and running from officers alone is not enough to establish the necessary suspicion for them to conduct a field interrogation. The eight shootings in the span of three months here is important context that must be applied to this particular incident. Given this context, the victim had every reason to believe he could be in danger even if he knew the persons chasing him were police officers.</p>

<p>In Mississippi, the Massachusetts Supreme Court's ruling only has persuasive authority and is not binding. Nonetheless, it should be, and it is still instructive because black people throughout the United States are subject to the same human rights violations by police.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of this shooting, like with others, the officers-involved identities have not been disclosed to the public. They have been given a paid vacation while their colleagues investigate their actions. This is detestable and unacceptable. The Lumumba administration is complicit in these instances of police violence by virtue of its deafening silence on the issue. The residents of Jackson must hold both JPD's and the Lumumba administration's feet to the fire with respect to what is clearly a pattern of human-rights abuses.</p>

<p>The people must demand that the identities of the officers in this most recent shooting, as well as others, are disclosed. The officers involved should be fired immediately, or at the very least, residents of Jackson should not continue to pay them for exacting violence and brutality under the color of law. The Lumumba administration should order an external audit of JPD's policies and procedures, including but not limited to, its use-of-force policy.</p>

<p>The Jackson community should be integrally involved in the reshaping of the department's policies and procedures because we are subject to them.</p>

<p>The urns weren't memorials. They were storage. They were the remains family members did not wish to acknowledge. They were the ashes of dying men who returned to Mississippi to live out their lives, only to discover their families would not permit anyone living with AIDS, even kinfolk, into their homes.</p>

<p>The sick came from New York, Los Angeles and Dallas, the larger urban centers where the scourge first took hold. Prejudice drove relatives to close their doors. Landlords and neighborhood associations did the same, denying residency to those struck with the enigmatic incipient disease called AIDS.</p>

<p>The Sandifer House, named after the late civil- and gay-rights advocate Eddie Sandifer, rose from this environment. Opening in 1987, the Sandifer House on Jefferson Street offered men and women living with the disease respite from the continuing stigma of being HIV-positive in the early years of the AIDS crisis.</p>

<p>It was at the Sandifer House where Jackson's gay community provided services to their own—filling needs larger societal institutions like government, hospital and family failed to address.</p>

<p>From Robbery to Vigils</p>

<p>"We all figured HIV would come to Jackson eventually," the late Eddie Sandifer said from a rocking chair in his one-story south Jackson home in 2016. For six decades, the brazen activist donated his energy to civil-rights activism, conventional and not. Sandifer even robbed jewelry stores in the 1960s to help fund civil-rights organizations, earning himself time in Parchman for the crimes.</p>

<p>"My radicalism has gotten me in a lot more trouble than my being gay," he said. Sandifer formed the now-defunct Jackson branch of the Gray Panthers advocacy group for senior citizens and often married same-sex couples in unofficial ceremonies throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Providing direct services to those in need was his specialty, one Sandifer honed as a nursing-home administrator for 20 years. He also became the director of the Mississippi Gay and Lesbian Alliance in 1974.</p>

<p>When the weekly gay-interest publication from the alliance, This Month in Mississippi, mentioned expanding cases of the new and fatal HTLV-3 virus killing off young men-having-sex-with-men, often called MSM, in New York and San Francisco, Sandifer knew Jackson had to be prepared. The 1980s continued an era of free love in the gay community, where promiscuity represented pride in who they were. If the disease did in fact spread through sex, it did so quickly. Those native Mississippians who contracted HIV elsewhere would return home to live out the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>"At least for a particular amount of time, people felt more protected in the smaller cities of the South," Dr. Jeffrey Kelly, a clinical psychologist and one of the first doctors to treat AIDS cases in Mississippi, said, "but it obviously wasn't true."</p>

<p>Kelly was on staff at the University of Mississippi Medical Center when the first known HIV-positive patient arrived in Mississippi. That patient survived only a few days, but by 1985, more Mississippi natives living with HIV were returning and finding themselves without a home here.</p>

<p>"There was paranoia and hysteria around HIV then and not many effective community responses were happening outside of the gay community here," Kelly said. Families shunned those infected, the government was silent, and at the time, UMMC was weary of becoming known as "the AIDS hospital," he said.</p>

<p>"I think the gay community realized they had to provide their own answer."</p>

<p>The first line of Sandifer House's mission statement promises "to provide a group home for the support and care of persons living with AIDS that have no other appropriate housing options."</p>

<p>MGLA rented a large white Belhaven Heights home around 1986 with help from private donors like Levi Strauss Co., which operates a factory in Canton. Sandifer's partner of more than 30 years, Steven Ray, who is known as Chris, said they even received donations and support from some City and State leaders. Twelve people occupied the house at a given time. They shared rooms, and when one resident passed, another filled the vacancy quickly.</p>

<p>The residents were young, 20s and 30s (some older), and mostly men. Many first encountered Sandifer as his car ambled up their driveway to provide transportation to UMMC or other facilities for testing or to the Sandifer House for long-term housing. The pick-ups occurred in the discrete dark of night, so as to not tip off family members and neighbors to any association with the stigmatized illness.</p>

<p>"The neighbors threatened to burn down one person's home south of Meridian when they found out he was positive," Sandifer said.</p>

<p>By day, he worked at a desk near the house's front entrance while the gaunt residents passed time playing cards, watching television and cooking.</p>

<p>"They were close. They became family, most of them," Sandifer said.</p>

<p>When a resident's condition grew dire, it was up to him and the other residents, those well enough to assist, to tend to them. They picked up medication, cleaned up diarrhea, called ambulances. Ray estimates that it cost $5,000 a month to operate the house, a constant expense that the local gay community helped cover. He says the house required ongoing maintenance—he recalls doing plumbing work in the dead of winter. At Jack and Jill's Tavern (now closed), owner Jack Myers charged an extra cover for years, with all proceeds going to MGLA.</p>

<p>The gay bars were the communal gathering spaces for a grieving community. Jack and Jill's main room held cigarette-lighter vigils almost every week. It was difficult to find anyone in the gay community whose inner circle was not affected by AIDS back then.</p>

<p>"I lost a lot of friends," Myers said. Jack and Jill's donated $15,000 to the Sandifer House from 1985 until 1992, without which Sandifer said the house could not have functioned. No government agency at the local, state or national level provided funding.</p>

<p>'Not All Gloom and Doom'</p>

<p>MGLA provided meals and maintenance, though local churches and other groups such as Wells United Methodist Church would serve or bring meals. Priscilla Pearson was both a Wells Methodist volunteer and a neighbor in Belhaven Heights.</p>

<p>"Everyone referred to it as 'The AIDS House,'" Pearson said. "Inside was kind of a hushed setting. A sense of grave illness was present."</p>

<p>A dead man was lying on the sofa one night when Kelly was called to the Sandifer House. The resident had passed away earlier in the evening. Shaken residents sought out Kelly to come by for counseling.</p>

<p>"Not having spiritual support, social support, having to hide who you are, these are pretty bad for all people's well being, no matter what," Kelly told the Jackson Free Press. The belief that death was inevitable for those living with AIDS in that era gnawed at many Sandifer residents.</p>

<p>Kelly said what residents really needed that night was a minister, not a psychologist.</p>

<p>On assignment from The Clarion-Ledger, then-reporter Leesha Faulkner moved into the Sandifer House for two weeks in 1991 as part of a series titled "Living with AIDS." She played cards with the residents and read William Faulkner's "The Bear" with another.</p>

<p>Faulkner remembered some guys applying make-up and going out downtown at night. She and the residents joked about the police officers who hastily backed away from an approaching resident and the petrified patrons at the farmers market who feared AIDS could be transferred from a breath or a touch. Some people would even cross the sidewalk when they saw them coming.</p>

<p>"There were funny moments, not all doom and gloom," Faulkner said in an interview. "But there was a pall over the house. The illness did that."</p>

<p>One night, Faulkner was deep into a card game with a couple of other residents when a low moan resonated through the walls. The card game continued into the night, as did the moaning. It was coming from a dying resident in an adjacent room. The players did their best to ignore the helpless agony.</p>

<p>"What struck me then was that each resident was hearing his future that night. That still sticks with me to this day," Faulkner said.</p>

<p>Upon leaving the Sandifer House, Faulkner's then-husband made her get tested for HIV, not allowing her to live at home until she did so. Faulkner stayed in an apartment until the test results ultimately came back negative. Like the subjects of her reporting, the stigma surrounding HIV prevented her from going home.</p>

<p>Faulkner's Sandifer House articles, around a dozen, ran in The Clarion-Ledger in early March 1991. Within two weeks after the series was published, she says, each resident she lived with had died.</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for Eddie, I don't know where they could have gone," Faulkner, who now works as communications director for the City of Tupelo, said.</p>

<p>Vivid in Faulkner's memories is the anxiety other Belhaven Heights residents showed toward the house and its occupants then.</p>

<p>"People would always walk on the other side of the house," she said. "They treated the residents with disdain."</p>

<p>Sandifer recalls a neighbor across the street who would report the license-plate numbers of visiting doctors and nurses to the Mississippi Department of Health until the doctors and nurses stopped coming by.</p>

<p>"Many still thought it was a contagious disease, that a wave could pass it," Sandifer said. "The residents were the new lepers."</p>

<p>Pearson believes it was economic fear that drove the neighborhood to oppose the house. "'Not by our house' was the mentality," Pearson said. "It wasn't that they had no sense of the illness. People wanted to protect their investment."</p>

<p>From the moment the Sandifer House opened, the Belhaven Heights Conservation Association fought to have it closed. Margaret Moize, the association president, petitioned the City of Jackson to shut it down, the Associated Press reported at the time.</p>

<p>A Jackson Daily News story from the late 1980s says Moize contended that the Sandifer House should be classified as a hospice, which would require approval from the Mississippi State Board of Health to operate. But MGLA opened the Sandifer House as a boarding home, which required no State approval. Eventually, the Jackson City Council ruled against the neighborhood association, and the Sandifer House continued operating as a boarding home.</p>

<p>Then-Mayor Dale Danks Jr. could have vetoed the council ruling, but in a lengthy statement, the three-term Democrat wrote that treating the Sandifer House any differently from similar personal-care homes in the Jackson "would constitute a violation of equal protection of the law." The neighborhood association appealed the ruling to the Hinds County Circuit Court, but the "boarding home" label for the Sandifer House remained in place.</p>

<p>By the early 1990s, the infrastructure of the house was in dire need of upkeep. A financial shortfall kept the sunken floorboards from repair, with the sole working bathroom descending lower and lower. A fetid smell took hold in the house, and rodents scurrying by became a prevalent sight. Occupancy was halved to six residents, and Sandifer's fundraising efforts could not relieve the budget strain.</p>

<p>In October 1992, MGLA elected to close down the Sandifer House. Sandifer and the organization did their best to find housing for the last residents. Ray provided shelter to the last three people after the house closed.</p>

<p>Sandifer Returns Home</p>

<p>The roads of Belhaven Heights are smoother now than they were a quarter-century ago. The azure summer sky had yet to fade as Eddie Sandifer delicately exited the car in front of the Jefferson Street house in August 2015. Helped by his walker and wearing white tennis shoes, gray sweatpants and a white charity T-shirt, the 86-year-old headed toward the old Sandifer House for the first time since the last resident packed up in 1992. The Belhaven Heights Neighborhood Association raised no objections. Residents did not report any license-plate numbers.</p>

<p>The current occupants of the old Sandifer House, Kim and Dale Gibson, greeted Sandifer at the door. The husband and wife are familiar with the home's history, but until recently were unaware the its former namesake was still living. Sandifer traced its history through the hallways.</p>

<p>"My office was right over there," Sandifer said. He walked by the mantel where the urns had sat. He walked past what was the dining room where Leesha Faulkner played cards and Kelly counseled the dying residents late into the night.</p>

<p>"Being back is really nice. I was well pleased with the house," he said.</p>

<p>A white Delta baggage label was around the handle of Sandifer's walker. He had recently returned from panels in Washington, D.C., and New York City, where he spoke of his jewelry-store escapades during the civil-rights era. These speaking events were rare for Sandifer in the years before his death. Although he kept abreast of the latest developments surrounding HIV advocacy in Mississippi, his activism years were behind him. He spent his final days mostly at home, in his bedroom, watching the news from the rocking chair as his black lab, B.B. Ray, interrogated every shoe in the room.</p>

<p>Sandifer's cremated remains now sit in his former south Jackson home. The capital city where his other house once gave shelter to the desperate is still dealing with a housing battle that has been waging for three decades and counting.</p>

<p>While medical advances have stopped AIDS from being a death sentence, the overlap of the disease and homelessness among the LGBT population in Jackson persists. The Mississippi Department of Health data show that Hinds County had 96 reported HIV cases in 2016, with 424 statewide. Jackson is one of the epicenters of the nation's HIV epidemic. AIDSVu estimates that 2,797 Jacksonians are living with HIV, the majority of them black men.</p>

<p>Grace House, which opened its doors in 1995, three years after the Sandifer House closed, is one of three local organizations specifically designed to serve the housing needs of Jacksonians living with HIV.</p>

<p>"Both AIDS and homelessness are at epidemic numbers," Catherine Sullivan, executive director of Grace House, said in February 2018. "It's abysmal."</p>

<p>An influx of federal grants from the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS program is allowing Grace House to expand the number of beds it can offer to 600 to 800 a year. Still, Sullivan says that the path to lowering homelessness rates is through erasing the lingering stigma tied to the disease, along with reasons such as creating equal access to care.</p>

<p>"Stigma is huge," Sullivan said. "(With) the African American community in the Bible Belt, the stigma is glaring. Even the LGBT community can stigmatize HIV and AIDS. It is stigma on top of stigma on top of stigma."</p>

<p>Rovoskie Mays, who is HIV-positive and working toward an associate degree in nursing, has experienced this stigma firsthand. He found out he has the disease in October 2015. On a recommendation from his UMMC doctor, a skeptical Mays entered the Grace House. In addition to a warm bed, Mays, 22, receives food, schooling and medicine from the place he now calls "life-saving beyond measures."</p>

<p>"Grace House helps people remember that they're still human," he said. "There I learned to be brave, to have peace, and be proud of who I am."</p>

<p>Both Grace House and Mays are inextricably linked to the same community and struggle Sandifer fought to assist many years ago. The struggle endures, but with adequate funding and effective medicine, the potential to curb homelessness among Jacksonians living with AIDS is greater than ever before, even if the stigma sadly remains.</p>

<h2 id="numberofjpdofficerinvolvedshootingskeepsgrowing">Number of JPD Officer-Involved Shootings Keeps Growing</h2>

<p>Police say five officer-involved shootings have occurred since Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba took office in July 2017. The Jackson Free Press counts seven in that timeframe as of March 1.

<p>Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — With two deadly officer-involved shootings in the first two months of 2018, public scrutiny has grown over the Jackson Police Department's use-of-force policy and its decision to withhold officers' names until they complete an internal investigation, a criminal investigation and a Hinds County grand jury returns an indictment—a process that can take at least a year. This Mississippi Burueau of Investigations now handles these cases as well.</p>

<p>The mayor created an officer-identification task force to develop City policy around how JPD will deal with the release of officers' names and the time frame in which that takes palce.</p>

<p>In the meantime, individual officers who shoot civilians are not held accountable to the public despite citizens' tax-dollars funding salaries for them on paid leave following these incidents. The lack of transparency has also translated into varying reports on the sheer number of times JPD officers have shot at civilians.</p>

<p>Police told the Jackson Free Press Wednesday, Feb. 28 that there had been five officer-involved shootings since Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba took office in July 2017. The Jackson Free Press counted seven in that timeframe and eight total officer-involved shootings to date under mayor Lumumba based on press briefings, local media reports and the JPD Twitter feed.</p>

<p>This post will be updated regularly to reflect any newly found information, including the names of officers involved, should they become available.</p>

<p>May 2018 </p>

<p>Elliot Reed, 30 (deceased) and Chauncy Reed, 26 </p>

<p>In a statement, JPD said police responded to a shooting involving an officer that occurred in the 900 block of Cooper Road at the Valero.</p>

<p>JPD said shortly after 1:00am this morning (Wednesday, May 9), an officer encountered the driver and passenger of a white SUV following a traffic stop.</p>

<p>"Following that encounter, shots were fired, from both the suspects and the officer," a statement reads.</p>

<p>One suspect, Elliot Reed, was critically injured and transported to a local hospital and he later died. The second, 26-year-old Chauncy Reed, was taken into custody at the scene. The officer did not suffer any serious injuries during the incident.</p>

<p>Chauncy Reed has been charged with Aggravated Assault on a Police Officer and Capital Murder.</p>

<p>The officer's name has not been released.</p>

<p>This investigation is being conducted by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>February 2018</p>

<p>Lee Edward Bonner, 37</p>

<p>Bonner died as a result of an officer-involved shooting that took place on Feb. 21 on the 1300 block of Deer Park Street at about 3 p.m. A narcotics investigation resulted in an alleged shootout. Officers pursued two men originally, but they lost sight of one in a wooded area behind an abandoned house, police said.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said narcotics officers noticed the second individual, Bonner, displayed a weapon, and that there was a shot and officers returned fire. Bonner later died as a result of his injuries.</p>

<p>At the scene, Holmes did not reveal if officers uncovered narcotics. He also said officers were not in standard police uniform because they were detectives.</p>

<p>The two officers involved are on paid administrative leave pending investigation, and their identities have not been released.</p>

<p>January 2018</p>

<p>Crystalline Barnes, 21</p>

<p>Barnes died on Jan. 27 after an early-morning traffic stop in response to a report that she may have forced another motorist off the roadway.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department spokesman Roderick Holmes said the officer that made the stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said in a statement.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," the statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect (sic) vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Then Holmes said Barnes drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>JPD did not confirm whether Barnes died of a gunshot or from the collision soon afterward, saying only that she was "fatally wounded." JPD implied that the deceased young woman may have a criminal history—they released what looked like a mugshot in the accompanying press releases to media. Mayor Lumumba signed an executive order on Feb. 26 to stop JPD from disseminating mugshots of those shot by police.</p>

<p>Both officers are on administrative leave with pay as the internal and criminal investigation unfold. Police have not released their identities.</p>

<p>Reginald Harper, 26</p>

<p>On Jan. 4 police shot at Harper on the 3100 block of Terry Road near the Sunshine Food Mart . An off-duty officer was at the Popeye's nearby when staff told him there was a black man inside being unruly and disruptive. The officer located him near Sunshine and called for backup.</p>

<p>"The suspect could be heard verbally threatening to do harm to the officers," Holmes wrote in a statement to media. Holmes said the suspect, Harper, retrieved "what appeared to be a silver handgun from his waistband and pointed the weapon at officers."</p>

<p>An officer discharged his weapon twice before Harper fled. A vehicle in the area got hit in the crossfire, but no one was hurt.</p>

<p>On Jan. 6 Harper was found and arrested for attempted aggravated assault on a police officer. It is unclear the type of injuries, if any, he sustained in the incident. It is also unknown who the officers in the incident were, or whether or not they are on paid leave.</p>

<p>November 2017</p>

<p>Matthew Tate, 20, and Christopher Harvey, 24</p>

<p>On Nov. 24, 2017, JPD reported an incident that took place at a traffic stop on the 3000 block of Bienville Drive. Shortly after 3 a.m., police said as an officer approached the vehicle, the passenger "was exhibiting suspicious behavior" and later produced a handgun that he pointed at the officer.</p>

<p>The officer, who was not injured, fired shots at the car before it sped away. When police found Tate, the alleged shooter, walking in south Jackson, he appeared to have sustained a head injury.</p>

<p>Harvey, the driver, and Tate were both charged with aggravated assault on a police officer.</p>

<p>The identity of the officer and whether or not he or she is on paid leave is unknown.</p>

<p>Unidentified man with knife</p>

<p>In the first of two officer-involved shootings on Nov. 15, 2017, a female officer shot and killed a man who allegedly approached her with a 6-inch knife at about 5 p.m. She fired at least one shot into the man's chest.</p>

<p>The incident apparently happened on Mayes Street near Lampton Avenue.</p>

<p>The man, whose name has not been released to the public, died as a result of the shooting. The unnamed officer was not injured, and she was placed on administrative leave with pay.</p>

<p>Unidentified black male, 23</p>

<p>In the second officer-involved shooting on Nov. 15, 2017, a black man was shot in the leg in the Presidential Hills subdivision. Police say he did not stop at an administrative checkpoint. Officers further down the road apparently approached his vehicle, and he hit the gas, almost hitting them.</p>

<p>The man eventually stopped the car once he ended up driving into someone's yard a couple of streets over. Officers pursued him on foot, and when they found him in someone's backyard, they saw a black object in his hand that they believed to be a weapon. Despite verbal commands to drop it, police said the suspect ran and turned to point the black object at officers after which officers heard a shot. One officer returned fire, hitting the man in the leg. He apparently tried to continue running, but stopped because of his injuries.</p>

<p>Holmes said the suspect would be charged with aggravated assault on a police officer. It is unclear if police recovered the black object the suspect had in his hand, though Holmes said they found a gun in his car.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the officer who fired the shot was put on administrative leave with pay, nor has JPD released his or her name.</p>

<p>October 2017</p>

<p>On Oct. 27, 2017, JPD tweeted that police were on the scene of an officer-involved shooting at Memphis Street and Fontaine Avenue, where a black male was shot, but was in stable condition.</p>

<p>Local media reported that a 23-year-old man broke away from a group officers had approached. He started to run, and officers said he pulled out a gun. The police fired, striking the fleeing man in the side and back.</p>

<p>The officers were not injured, and two were placed on administrative leave with pay. Their names have not been released.</p>

<h2 id="hoodjoinsnetneutralityfight">Hood Joins Net Neutrality Fight</h2>

<p>by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>JACKSON — Attorney General Jim Hood will challenge the Federal Communications Commission's decision earlier this year to repeal net neutrality regulations.</p>

<p>The regulations, imposed during President Barack Obama's administration, ensure that Internet service providers do not speed up or slow down certain services or sites based on rivalries or company affiliations.</p>

<p>In December 2017, the FCC voted to dismantle net neutrality regulations, and the FCC published the final rule on the decision Feb. 22.</p>

<p>"(T)he Federal Communications Commission returns to the light-touch regulatory scheme that enabled the internet to develop and thrive for nearly two decades," the final rule says. "The Commission restores the classification of broadband internet access service as a lightly-regulated information service and reinstates the private mobile service classification of mobile broadband internet access service."</p>

<p>The new approach is set to take affect on April 23.</p>

<p>Hood joins 22 attorneys general who filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>"The repeal of net neutrality would have dire consequences for consumers and businesses in Mississippi and across the country who rely on and have a right to a free and open internet," Hood said in a press release. "A repeal would allow internet service providers to control and slow down consumers' lawful internet activity, which is unfair and un-American."</p>

<p>The attorneys general will argue that the rollback of net neutrality regulations violate federal law, including the Constitution and Communications Act of 1934. Hood lists several concerns with the rollback in a press release, including that the rule improperly and unlawfully includes sweeping preemption of state and local laws.</p>

<p>Most Republicans seem to be on board with the proposal, including Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who released a joint statement last year when FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced his rollback plan.</p>

<p>"We have long said that imposing a Depression-era, utility-style regulatory structure onto the internet was the wrong approach, and we applaud Chairman Pai's efforts to roll back these misguided regulations. Consumers want an open internet that doesn't discriminate on content, and protects free speech and consumer privacy," Wicker said in a joint statement with other senators. "It's now time for Republicans and Democrats, internet service providers, edge providers, and the internet community as a whole to come together and work toward a legislative solution that benefits consumers and the future of the internet."</p>

<p>Pai believes the move will stop federal government from micromanaging the Internet, the AP reported.</p>

<h2 id="jpdinvestigatingofficerinvolvedshooting">JPD Investigating Officer-Involved Shooting</h2>

<p>by: William Kelly III</p>

<p>William H. Kelly III.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Two unnamed male officers with the Jackson Police Department came into contact with two men at the 1300 block of Deer Park Street at about 3 p.m. Wednesday. A narcotics investigation resulted in an alleged shootout between officers and a man who's name has not yet been released.</p>

<p>JPD spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said the two men immediately took off running from officers, inciting a foot chase where one of the men got away—officers have not identified or located him.</p>

<p>"One individual, they lost sight of him in a wooded area behind an abandoned house," Holmes told the media on Wednesday. "The second individual actually ran between the wooded area and the house. They later came in contact with him in the front of that location."</p>

<p>Holmes said narcotics officers noticed the second individual displayed a weapon and that there was a shot and officers returned fire.</p>

<p>"They gave him several commands to drop the weapon," Holmes said Wednesday. "He refused to comply. He fired a shot at the officers, at least one shot that we know of, and the officers then returned fire."</p>

<p>Police say the man was struck at least two times and is in critical condition at an area hospital. The weapon was recovered for evidence and identified as a stolen weapon. The suspect, whose identity is not yet released, is a convicted felon, police say, but did not provide details.</p>

<p>Ophelia Catchings, the aunt of the man who was shot, said on the scene that she does not know what happened. Catchings heard gunshots and received a call from other family members and said that she immediately threw on clothes and drove to the scene.</p>

<p>At the scene, Holmes did not reveal if officers uncovered narcotics. He also said officers were not in standard police uniform because they are detectives.</p>

<p>Holmes said JPD's standard procedure is to place officers on administrative leave pending an internal investigation and a criminal investigation to determine if any laws had been broken. Their names may be released later in the investigation, he said, but that is at JPD's discretion.</p>

<p>"When we have an internal investigation like that, it's just standard that we don't release the names until we obviously get to a certain point, and at that point we determine whether or not we release those names," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>This marks the second JPD officer-involved shooting this year.</p>

<p>Early on Jan. 27, two Jackson police officers shot at 21-year-old Crystalline Barnes during a traffic stop in response to a report that Barnes may have forced another motorist off the roadway.</p>

<p>Holmes said the officer that made the stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said in a statement the same day as the incident.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," the statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect's (sic) vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Then Holmes said Barnes drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>JPD has been very tight-lipped in not releasing the names of the officers nor did they confirm whether Barnes died of a gunshot or from the collision soon afterward, saying only that she was "fatally wounded."</p>

<p>In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice advised police departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident.</p>

<p>STARKVILLE, Miss. (AP) — Leaders of a Mississippi college town have denied a request to host the city's first gay pride parade, a decision that left some members of the group in tears and drew criticism from the mayor.</p>

<p>Starkville Pride, an LGBT support group, had planned to hold the parade March 24 in Starkville.</p>

<p>But Starkville aldermen on Tuesday voted 4-3 against the permit. Three of the aldermen who voted to reject it left the meeting room through a back entrance, and none of the alderman who voted no voiced their opinions at the meeting, The Dispatch reported .</p>

<p>Sixteen people had spoken in favor of having the gay pride parade, and two had spoken against it, The Starkville Daily News reported .</p>

<p>Resident Dorothy Isaac said she was against the parade because "God created Adam and Eve."</p>

<p>"Do not turn our city into a sin city," Isaac said. "It should not be this."</p>

<p>Resident Kevin Williams, who spoke in favor of the parade, said this was a time for the city to be on the right side of history. Many years ago, African-American people would have been denied the same type of request, he said.</p>

<p>Starkville Mayor Lynn Spruill said she was disappointed with the decision.</p>

<p>The town is home to Mississippi State University. Spruill noted that Oxford, Mississippi, where the University of Mississippi is based, has held gay pride parades for several years.</p>

<p>"I think it sends a message that we are not the inclusive community that I believe us to be," the mayor said of the decision.</p>

<p>Alderman Jason Walker, who voted in support of the parade, said he was disappointed that his colleagues who voted no have given no explanation for their decision.</p>

<p>"It's unfortunate that you go through the process, you do everything you're supposed to do and you get denied, really without any explanation as to why," Walker said.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Proposed legislation to crack down on gangs statewide could lead to increased prison costs, a move that would counteract the state's progress in decreasing the number of inmates—and taxpayer dollars used to incarcerate those inmates—since 2014.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 2868 would broaden the definition of a "gang" in state law as well as add an additional penalty and sentence for any crime proved to be "criminal gang activity," for a minimum of five years and up to 15 years in prison.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators and prosecutors in the state say they need the legislation to crack down on gang violence in the state, but Democrats in both the House and the Senate, as well as community organizations and anti-violence experts, have serious doubts about the measure.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Legislative Black Caucus held a hearing on the bill, with a couple of Republicans also in attendance. Lawmakers heard from lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the NAACP.</p>

<p>Corey Wiggins, executive director of the Mississippi NAACP chapter, said his organization opposes the expanded gang bill.</p>

<p>"We don't think that this legislation is something that is positive, particularly in our communities," Wiggins said. "And we are looking for something that specifically addresses criminal-justice reform in a real way that supports communities and creates opportunities for employment, creates opportunities for economic development."</p>

<p>Lawmakers also heard from the state public defender Andre de Gruy who had run numbers on the legislation. During debate, some legislators asked for a fiscal note on the bill, but so far Senate Bill 2868 does not have a fiscal note attached.</p>

<p>De Gruy estimates that one person sentenced to 15 years for gang-related activity under the proposed law would cost taxpayers more than $110,000 for each inmate. If the nearly 12,000 identified gang members in MDOC's custody were sentenced with the enhanced penalties in Senate Bill 2868, it would cost the state up to $1.35 billion in additional prison costs.</p>

<p>The 2017 Mississippi Gang Assessment estimates that about 62 percent of the prison population in the state identify as gang members. De Gruy, who serves on the state's Corrections and Criminal Justice Task Force, said the tie between violence and gang membership is not there in the limited data the state does have, however.</p>

<p>He told lawmakers Wednesday that the majority of inmates released from the Mississippi Department of Corrections have committed nonviolent crimes, including those identified as gang members coming back to the community.</p>

<p>"(Of) gang members and non-gang members, 72 percent have committed a nonviolent crime. Among gang members it was 79 percent, so the tie between gang membership and violent crime isn't apparent in the limited data we do have," he said.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Legislature passed House Bill 585 to reduce the costs of incarceration and loosen sentences for those accused of nonviolent crimes. De Gruy said crime rates in the state are actually declining since 2014.</p>

<p>"If gangs are driving crime and gang (activities) are going up, we would see the opposite. I don't think the data supports this because I don't think there's enough data, but it appears that gang involvement in Mississippi is going down," he said.</p>

<p>"... There's also no evidence that simply enhancing a sentence, or making a sentence longer, is going to affect the activity you're trying to target. There's no evidence that you're going to have less drug dealing because we have an enhanced statute."</p>

<p>De Gruy said that enhanced sentences disproportionately affect African Americans in the state, based on the research the task force did while implementing House Bill 585.</p>

<p>"When we looked at the population that is serving enhanced sentences in 2014, 80 percent were African American. ... So again, historically, enhancements are used disproportionately against African Americans."</p>

<p>A white gang, the Simon City Royals, however, is the third largest gang in the state, a state gang assessment using MAGI data states.</p>

<p>Other research backs up de Gruy's findings and shows that increasing penalties and more jail time does not decrease gang activity. Part of the $500,000 taxpayer-funded BOTEC analysis of the Jackson area focused on gang prevention in the state capital.</p>

<p>"Fortunately, the evidence is clear that solving a youth violence problem does not require defining gangs or counting their members. The ability to stop groups of young people from committing violent crimes is solved with unbiased examination of data, followed by a strategy that incorporates the lessons from other communities while accepting whatever unique features are a part of Jackson's problem," the BOTEC gang violence assessment says.</p>

<p>The BOTEC analysis lays out a strategic plan, with several phases, that communities in other parts of the country have taken to prevent gang violence. In Fresno, Calif., a group of pastors, former gang members, service providers and law enforcement officers began meeting monthly to shape a violence reduction strategy in order to combat gangs.</p>

<p>One of the lead researchers for the 2016 BOTEC reporter, Ron Noblet, told the Jackson Free Press that the gang bill is overly broad and that is unwise to focus on apprehending people associated with a gang rather than investigating violence crime.</p>

<p>Joy Hogge, the executive director of Families as Allies, addressed her concerns for kids and families whom the bill might endanger. "This bill has the potential to disproportionately affect youth of color," she said, noting that her organization gets lots of calls from families interacting with law enforcement.</p>

<p>"... If we look at those calls about an adolescent male being stopped by police, those who are African American are much more likely to experience harsher consequences than those who are white, that's just the reality, and this bill makes that even scarier for parents of young men who are African American."</p>

<p>The gang bill is in the House, and has yet to be assigned to a committee for consideration.</p>

<h2 id="reentryreformsstillaliveinlegislature">Re-Entry Reforms Still Alive in Legislature</h2>

<p>by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-14</p>

<p>JACKSON — Mississippi can begin to look at justice reinvestment, and it should be a priority, Andre de Gruy, the state public defender who is also on the state's Corrections and Criminal Justice Oversight Task Force, told the re-entry council earlier this month. In 2014, the Legislature passed a criminal-justice reform package that decreased the number of men and women incarcerated in the state. De Gruy said the idea behind reducing the number of people behind bars is to reinvest those funds in re-entry efforts.</p>

<p>"Those savings should be going into programs that will keep people out of prison, and that's sort of (why) the re-entry council came about to kind of come up with things we can spend that money on," he said.</p>

<p>While several criminal-justice reform bills are dead, lawmakers could still consider several measures that would positively affect re-entry opportunities for men and women returning from prison. The state's re-entry council met on Friday, Feb. 2, to go over some of their recommendations as well as review what legislation is still moving forward this session. One solution is to repurpose or use drug courts as re-entry courts, U.S. District Judge Keith Starrett, who sits on the re-entry council, stressed. These types of courts are common all over the country, specifically for people who leave prison with a substance-addiction problem, he said.</p>

<p>"You don't mix the high-risk offenders—the ones who are coming out of prison who score high on the risk assessment—with the low-risk offenders," he said on Feb. 2. "... They have to be separated."</p>

<p>Legislation to open drug courts to more offenders died in House and Senate committees this year, and de Gruy said the drug-court budget would have to be increased to make the recommendation a reality. Several re-entry bills are still alive in the Legislature that have a decent chance of becoming law, however. The Oversight Task Force 2017 report recommends that the Mississippi Department of Corrections develop parole case plans for all inmates, which is carrying out an initial recommendation from the 2015 criminal-justice reform package. De Gruy told the re-entry council on Feb. 2 that House Bill 1172 contained the changes needed for MDOC to keep up with the rapid intake of case plans. MDOC cannot keep up with the current time restrictions on case plans in state law.</p>

<p>"Basically, it's kind of like your progress report for kids in school. You work with them, tell them what programming they need based on these risk assessments. It's something that takes some work to get together, and then it takes work to monitor each offender who's eligible as they go through the process," he said.</p>

<p>De Gruy said about 1,700 inmates are eligible under the bill for parole, and need case plans. House Bill 1172 passed that chamber last week, and the Senate will need to pass the bill to give MDOC the flexibility to keep up with the demand. Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Jim Kitchens asked who gets a case plan.</p>

<p>"Any chance it could be backed up to cover people who are not new offenders?" Kitchens asked de Gruy earlier this month at the re-entry council meeting.</p>

<p>"Ideally, I think they should, and I would hope that if they get to the point where they could do that," de Gruy answered.</p>

<p>Currently, case plans are for inmates who were convicted after July 1, 2014.</p>

<p>The Senate could consider another bill that would provide income tax credits to those who hire previously incarcerated men and women. House Bill 175 provides $2,500 for four years each former prisoner is employed. De Gruy said even if the Legislature amends bill is amended, any income tax credit is better than none at all.</p>

<p>"You have to start somewhere..." he cautioned. "Anything it does is more than we have now."</p>

<p>Several re-entry council proposals that died last year are in House Bill 387, which the Senate Corrections Committee will have to take up. Other reforms from the re-entry council are in Senate Bill 2841, which was dramatically amended before the Senate passed it last week.</p>

<h2 id="decriminalizingpotinthecity">Decriminalizing Pot in the City</h2>

<p>by: Ko Bragg</p>

<p>Ward 4 Councilman De’Keither Stamps proposed decriminalizing simple possession of marijuana in Jackson to free up police resources to focus on other crimes and to reduce the number who go to jail for small amounts. Photo by</p>

<p>Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Jennifer Riley-Collins is a veteran of the U.S. Army, as well as the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi. She has been on both active and reserve duty for more than 30 years. At a Feb. 5 public hearing, she shared that her life would torpedo, and she would lose her hard-earned benefits if she were caught with even 30 grams or less of marijuana.</p>

<p>"If I were impacted by being arrested for simple possession of marijuana, I may lose my veterans benefits," Riley-Collins said. "I worked 32 years for them—that's not something I want to lose.</p>

<p>"Someone who went to war should not be forced to risk losing their veterans benefits because they were arrested for an ounce of marijuana."</p>

<p>Jackson has become the latest city in the nation to propose legislation to decriminalize marijuana possession of 30 grams or less within city limits. The Jackson City Council passed Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps' ordinance to free up police resources to focus on other crimes and to offer relief to those who are thrown into the criminal-justice system for personal-use possession on Feb. 13.</p>

<p>Decriminalizing simple possession within Jackson's limits is not a panacea—possessing marijuana will still be illegal. If you are caught outside the city limits or by anyone who is not a Jackson police officer, state and federal laws can make the result more complicated. That is especially true under U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p>

<p>'I Get It, Trust Me'</p>

<p>The new city ordinance says that those in possession of 30 grams of marijuana or less would pay a fine of no more than $100 and face no prison time. But, state law does not outline any jail time for the first time someone is caught with 30 grams of marijuana or less, rather a fine of $100 to $250. A second conviction for simple possession within two years yields a $250 fine, no more than 60 days in the county jail and mandatory enrollment in a drug-education program unless a court finds the sentence inappropriate. Any subsequent conviction within two years merits a fine between $250 and $1,000 and up to six months in county jail.</p>

<p>Stamps' ordinance says the Jackson Police Department may implement a mandatory training on how City ordinances differ with state law, but there are still gaps. What will happen to those charged more than once with simple possession? Will the $100 maximum fine apply to each conviction for simple possession? Ward 2 Councilman Melvin Priester Jr. spoke about the importance of nuance.</p>

<p>"Honestly, in my opinion, this is more of a political statement—it doesn't change the fact that this is still illegal at the state level," Priester said. "I have some real questions about what this practically means, though I support the political gesture."</p>

<p>Stamps did not outline what happens if someone is caught with 30 grams or less in a motor vehicle. State law says a driver with up to 30 grams of marijuana could face a maximum fine of $1,000, up to 90 days in county jail or both if convicted.</p>

<p>Local attorney Chuck Mullins doubts the City ordinance would stand up in court if the attorney general's office took issue.</p>

<p>"Forget about the marijuana," he told the Jackson Free Press on Feb. 5. "What if it was another law that is inconsistent or in conflict with state statute? It's the principle of the thing—you can't pass laws which are inconsistent with state laws."</p>

<p>Mullins suggests a standing order with city court judges saying that people will not go to jail for 30 grams or less regardless of how many convictions. Either way, he is sympathetic to the cause.</p>

<p>"I get it, trust me," Mullins said. "I get what they're trying to do. It makes sense because a lot of times you get folks out there, and they've got this personal possession, personal-use crime, and you know it's only going to be a fine, but you're going to have to take them down to the jail...."</p>

<p>State, Federal and Beyond</p>

<p>In 2014, Gov. Phil Bryant signed "Harper Grace's Law" to exempt certain uses of cannabidiol oil. The law also decriminalized marijuana for research purposes at the University of Mississippi. Attorney General Jim Hood recently spoke on C-SPAN's "Washington Journal" and addressed his views on marijuana as an "old, gray-haired drug warrior" and prosecutor.</p>

<p>"Eventually, our young people are going to change it—they're going to change the law in our state, probably legalize it, probably in my lifetime in the next 20 years," Hood said on Feb. 7.</p>

<p>Currently, at the federal level simple possession with no intent to distribute is punishable by up to one year in prison, a minimum fine of $1,000 or both. On Jan. 4, Sessions sent out a memo to all U.S. attorneys reversing President Barack Obama's policy of essentially non-interference at the federal level in states that passed decriminalization laws. Sessions also said recently that marijuana is a gateway drug to opioid addiction, which drug researchers dispute.</p>

<p>With differing, subjective statutes, it can be confusing to know where authorities stand. Atlanta is one recent example. Georgia state law prescribes imprisonment up to one year and a fine of up to $1,000 for possession of one ounce or less of marijuana. However, the Atlanta City Council voted in October 2017 to lower fines to $75 for marijuana possession up to an ounce and eliminate jail time.</p>

<p>"If you get arrested by anybody but a city cop, you're toast," Atlanta City Councilwoman Yolanda Adrean said in April 2017.</p>

<h2 id="neverbackdownmississippiescalateswarongangs">Never Back Down: Mississippi Escalates War on Gangs</h2>

<p>by: Donna Ladd</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-14</p>

<p>The Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators, a nonprofit association of law enforcement officers and prosecutors, has this logo on their website. MAGI is pushing lawmakers to pass the expanded gang legislation this session. Photo courtesy msmagi.com</p>

<p>Four 16-year-olds are standing on a street corner in Richland, Miss., all wearing identical hoodies. One of them has a little more than 30 grams of marijuana on him. A police officer stops the young men, believing they are a gang because they're dressed alike, and finds the pot.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, the young man with the pot would face a possible three-year sentence under state law.</p>

<p>But the officer is not done. He takes all of them to jail, charging each with gang activity because they are dressed alike and have similar tattoos. That means each of them can go to prison for both the pot charge, plus an additional sentence of five to 15 years, if prosecutors can convince a jury they are part of a Mississippi gang.</p>

<p>The gang may not exactly be the Black Gangster Disciples, the Vice Lords or the Simon City Royals, the state's three biggest criminal street gangs. Maybe the four young men met at school, and they all needed money so they decided to sell pot. Maybe they've never lifted a finger against anyone else. Maybe it's their first pot sale.</p>

<p>Maybe their families do not or cannot do enough to keep them off the corner. Maybe one or both parents are already in prison for a drug charge and cannot provide for them. Maybe they or their parents, or both, are addicted to a substance. Maybe the boys call themselves something like "Rankin $$ Boyz 39073" for fun and bravado. Maybe they are future doctors, lawyers and legislators if they don't end up in prison for years because they were stupid enough to wear matching sweatshirts and not stay away from weed.</p>

<p>Either way, Mississippi law enforcement may soon be able to decide the boys are a gang even if they're not part of a larger criminal enterprise with a hierarchy and criminal connections beyond whomever they got the pot from. Under Mississippi's proposed gang-law expansion, Senate Bill 2868, police and prosecutors would have the flexibility to call them a "gang" and a decent shot of proving it in a court of law, and then require that the judge order consecutive sentencing. That could be another five, 10, 15 years for each of the boys on top of the three years for the pot charge.</p>

<p>The bill allows a judge to suspend a mandatory or enhanced punishment and impose alternative punishment "only in an unusual case where the interests of justice would be best served," and only if the judge enters the specific reasons into the court minutes.</p>

<p>Mississippi Sen. Derrick Simmons, a Democratic black lawmaker from Greenville, used a variation of that hypothetical on the Senate floor last week to challenge the gang bill and Sen. Brice Wiggins, its biggest cheerleader in the Legislature. Wiggins is a Republican from Pascagoula and a former prosecutor who has been pushing for an expanded gang law in recent years. He saw a similar law, which he added into a amendment to another bill, fail last session.</p>

<p>After Simmons presented the four-guys-in-a-hoodie scenario—without placing them in Rankin County, though—Simmons looked at Wiggins and asked, "You understand my concern?"</p>

<p>Wiggins equivocated in response. "Again, only if the elements are there, and it's proven for criminal gang activity. ... If it's just drugs, I would hope they wouldn't be charged if there's no probable cause for criminal gang activity," Wiggins said. "... I know what you're asking, but I don't think it works that way, to be quite honest."</p>

<p>"But there's nothing in the bill that would prohibit or stop law enforcement or a prosecutor from charging them," Simmons pointed out to Wiggins.</p>

<p>"No, but that's why they hire people like you or excellent criminal defense attorneys to get that addressed in a court of law," Wiggins responded, raising eyebrows among those present who know that not all young people on a street corner can afford the same defense attorneys that legislators might hire should they get in trouble.</p>

<p>The Discretion Conundrum</p>

<p>The ongoing problem of "discretion" and how much to give law enforcement and prosecutors is an age-old criminal-justice dilemma. On the one hand, discretion can allow a police officer not to arrest someone she does not believe is a hardened criminal. On the other, it can enable law enforcement to act on either implicit or explicit biases to punish certain young people—say those of a particular race—the officers do not like.</p>

<p>In today's America, it's not a secret that not all police officers are ethical—see the new corruption conviction of the Baltimore, Md., officers for planting evidence or the cops in Los Angeles who helped white supremacists, neither of which Mississippi has ever been immune to. It is also undeniable that the people caught up in bad policing are often powerless young men of color who are assumed to be criminals and who probably cannot afford those great attorneys Wiggins recommends.</p>

<p>The same bias could flow from black officers toward the white Simon City Royals, of course, but the Senate debate, and a previous one over the House's version of the gang bill, revealed that black lawmakers were far more likely to voice concerns about what overly broad police discretion can result in than even the white Democrats in the same room.</p>

<p>By Imani Khayyam</p>

<p>Sen. John Horhn, a black Jackson Democrat who pushed the Legislature to fund a $500,000 Botec Analysis study on crime in the capital city (which few other legislators seem to have read) challenged Wiggins' definition of what comprises a criminal group. He asked him if his bill would extend to corporate executives involved in a scandal similar to the WorldCom or Enron scams, and if they could qualify as a gang under the bill. Wiggins responded that he did not think so.</p>

<p>"Why not?" Horhn asked.</p>

<p>"Because that's not what the bill is aimed at. It's aiming at the criminals and the gangs that are in our communities," Wiggins said, skating past the fact that the WorldCom hustlers were right here in the Jackson metro, ripping off people they knew. "... We're talking about gangs. We could sit here and hypothetical all day long." He then added that a black House member had "said how bad the gangs were, so we're trying to solve an issue."</p>

<p>"It's not a Republican, Democrat(ic), black or white (issue)," Wiggins added.</p>

<p>Black legislators weren't buying it. "You mentioned the issue of people being preyed upon," Horhn said to Wiggins. "And in a lot of communities, not the Enron strata of communities but down to the poor, less powerful aspects of our communities, it's a matter of self-protection to join a gang. In the course of trying to survive their community, where there may be a gang presence, are we going to penalize those folks forced into gangs as a matter of self-protection?"</p>

<p>With that question, Horhn was drawing upon current criminal-justice research that shows that many young people of color actually carry weapons to protect themselves, just like many older white men, probably including legislators, in the state.</p>

<p>The "self-protection" question drew another virtual shrug from Wiggins, however. "No, I'm not concerned about that because this bill ..., if it becomes law, is aimed at those who are bringing youth into, and as I said, preying on our youth to join these gangs. No," he answered.</p>

<p>Except that the bill redefines "gang" as "an association of three or more persons whose members are involved in criminal gang activity"—who could be standing on the Richland corner selling that pot—"and who collectively identify themselves by adopting a group identity." That can be done in myriad ways: with a common name, slogan, sign, symbol, tattoo or other physical marking; style or color of clothing or hairstyle; a hand sign or gesture, or a finger position; or graffiti. The bill specifically exempts a sports team, a legal business or charity unless it was created as a "pretext for criminal gang activity," rather than becoming a criminal conspiracy like happened at Enron and WorldCom.</p>

<p>The logic is circular: Prosecutors could then use the expanded definition to widen the net to catch more gang members and then be able to charge more of them with criminal gang activity. So if one of the hoodie guys on the Richland corner commit a crime that is deemed "criminal gang activity," then all of them are automatically considered to be gang members if one of the shared elements is in place.</p>

<p>The bill does target coercing or encouraging another to commit a felony, but it also includes committing various other crimes, indicating that the bill is not only about "preying on our youth."</p>

<p>But Wiggins fell back to assuring the lawmakers that Mississippi police would not possibly apply the law unfairly .</p>

<p>"Profiling is wrong," he said. "The law enforcement I know don't do that. You always have a bad person here or there, and the law takes care of that, and I can assure you the folks I talked to about this bill, that is not what they want to do."</p>

<p>Ron Noblet, a lead investigator on the Legislature-funded 2016 BOTEC analysis study of Jackson gangs and crime, read the bill last week, as did his attorneys, and agreed with the black legislators that it gives police far too much discretion to make bad decisions. "It is either consciously or unconsciously written in a way that's extraordinarily broad," he said in a phone interview.</p>

<p>"We see it as just another pitiful way to keep people of color in prison, and to not deal with the fundamental problems that cause gangs in the first place," he added.</p>

<p>The gang bill, Noblet said, just focuses on more arrests rather than evidence-based solutions that can lower violence.</p>

<p>"If I say you're a gangster and that you're talking to gangsters, then you're a gangster. ... It is the standard way that law enforcement will try to deal with a problem that cannot be dealt with with force," said Noblet, who trains law enforcement around the country in effective gang intervention and consults with the Urban Peace Institute in Los Angeles, Calif.</p>

<p>Effective gang intervention is also not about cops playing warrior, or law enforcement being the only ones trying to stop violence. "Police should be there, part of the table. They should never be everyone at the table," Noblet warned.</p>

<p>'The Risk of Profiling'</p>

<p>The organization that is lobbying for SB 2868 and gathering evidence to support it has an intriguing logo—one that looks more like gang insignia than that of a collection of law enforcement, prosecutors and court officials from around the state. When you click to the website of the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators, called MAGI for short, you see a crudely drawn combat-green box with a white skull dripping with either paint or blood on top of two crossed AR-15-type rifles.</p>

<p>The site makes it clear that the goal of MAGI is to apprehend gang members and send them away to prison, preferably for a long time. Founded in 2008, the nonprofit association welcomes people associated with the criminal system "whose interest or primary investigative responsibilities include the identification and prosecution of crimes related to gang activity."</p>

<p>At its Nov. 5-8, 2017, state conference at the Golden Nugget in Biloxi—theme "Never Backing Down"—MAGI gave out questionnaires to 71 law-enforcement agencies around the state about what gangs and how many members they're identifying in their jurisdictions. The roster seems to be loosely defined to include any possible criminal group with a gang-esque name, no matter how large or small—from the Chicago-born Black Gangster Disciples to what they called "neighborhood cliques."</p>

<p>MAGI gave those responses to the federal Department of Homeland Security "fusion center" in Pearl, which published a Mississippi gang assessment in December. Now, SB 2868's backers are using that report to support the bill.</p>

<p>The report indicates that the Gangsters, the Vice Lords and the Simon City Royals—all gang brands that originated in Chicago decades ago—are the most prevalent gangs in the state and the ones involved in the most criminal activity, both inside and outside correctional facilities.</p>

<p>"The formation of hybrid gangs and neighborhood cliques has been the most notable trend," the assessment said. "These non-traditional gangs welcome merging of members from established gangs in order to unite over a specific territory."</p>

<p>It also recommended MAGI's "more inclusive gang bill ... to address the growing violent and organized gang activity." The report also makes it clear that the bill goes far beyond gangs recruiting youth.</p>

<p>"The draft bill creates the crime of criminal gang activity and addresses the problems associated with juvenile recruitment, youth gang members, the organized 'money men,' gang tactics and allows the use of a statewide Grand Jury." The grand jury is likely a way to prosecute alleged gang members outside jurisdictions that would likely be more skeptical, such as majority-black areas like Jackson or Greenville.</p>

<p>"(The new gang law) would further mandate statutory minimums for criminal gang activity and require the penalty for the crime to run consecutive to the underlying felony," the fusion center's assessment stated. That can mean long terms in prisons—with tough prison gangs—for anyone "associated" with a group that MAGI members decide to call a gang.</p>

<p>Sen. Barbara Blackmon, D-Canton, asked Wiggins on the Senate floor to tell her more about MAGI and his meetings with them. He said he went to one of their trainings on the Coast.</p>

<p>"Was it a diverse group?" Blackmon asked.</p>

<p>"Diverse in agencies?" Wiggins asked.</p>

<p>"No, diverse in hue."</p>

<p>"Hue? As in color? ... Yeah, as far as I can recall: white, black, everybody under the sun."</p>

<p>MAGI does have racial diversity in its ranks. And the gang assessment makes it clear that a white gang, the Simon City Royals, is one of the state's top challenges, especially on the Coast now. The organization even told The Clarion-Ledger that the most verified gang members in the state are now white.</p>

<p>Those facts do not negate the risk that such a broad law is still enforced harsher against people of color in neighborhoods considered crime-infested than it could be against white gang suspects, several violence experts told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>"Using a white gang as the reason for harsh and expansive anti-gang policies is undoubtedly a way to neutralize claims related to racial bias and profiling," criminal law professor Babe Howell of the CUNY School of Law, who specializes in gang and youth-crime enforcement, said last week.</p>

<p>The risk of profiling is still serious, Howell added: "Law enforcement tend to see criminal and group crime in any peer group of black and brown kids." Howell, who read the proposed Senate gang bill and the now-dead House version, as well as the fusion gang assessment, pointed out that the target of the coordinated effort is "not just gangs, but cliques and crews."</p>

<p>"(The bills) open individuals who grow up in crime-ridden areas to prosecution and incarceration based on the conduct of others," Howell said. "The bills create 'gang' offenses where the actions of others are relevant to prove that there is a gang and that the gang is engaged in criminal activity. The criminal trial becomes a circus in which an individual can easily be prosecuted based on association."</p>

<p>Noblet laughed out loud at the idea that the new gang law would not be used to racially profile because it targets a large white street gang, too.</p>

<p>"I laugh. It has nothing to do with reality of what happens," he said.</p>

<p>Brad Rowe, who was the CEO of BOTEC Analysis when it studied Jackson's crime and now runs RPM Policy and Media, agreed in an interview from Los Angeles. "That's equal opportunity suppression. ... (Law enforcement) can use the color of law to take down white kids as well," he said. But that does not mean they will not use it to profile people of color, he warned. It can be an overly broad and harsh law for a wide variety of people and still be worse for targets of color.</p>

<p>Targeting Violence</p>

<p>Regardless of race, though, language in the gang bill means someone might get additional sentencing for a crime just because they are associated with a gang or crew on MAGI's list—even if the crime itself was not related to gang activity. In the 2017 session, Sen. Wiggins even used high-profile murders of Jessica Chambers and Mercedes Williamson allegedly by men who were in gangs to argue for the bill, even though prosecutors in both cases say the murders were not gang-ordered or sanctioned.</p>

<p>The narrative of MAGI members is that someone who is in a gang and commits a crime, even if it is not related, is committing a "gang crime"—which essentially criminalizes being in a gang. The Clarion-Ledger reported in August 2017 that MAGI embraces the most broad—and confusing—definition possible. "But a gang crime, according to the Mississippi Association of Gang Members, is defined as any crime in which the victim or perpetrator is a member of a gang. It can be gang-related, in which there's just someone who is affiliated, or gang-motivated, in which the crime is ordered or caused by gang activity," the Ledger reporter stated.</p>

<p>SB 2868 language is not even that broad, but it is disturbing enough, law professor Howell said. "The bills designate conduct which is largely already criminal—committing felonies, intimidating witnesses, obstructing justice—as 'criminal gang activity.' ... The bills then enhance sentences and facilitate accessorial liability based on association. They tack on five to 15 years consecutive not for the criminal conduct itself but because of association. They prohibit association with any member of a gang post-release," Howell said.</p>

<p>"Because the bills criminalize already criminal behavior, they would be symbolic but for the costly sentence enhancements. ... Gang arrests and allegations create situations in which it is impossible to get a fair trial, and the innocent will be swept up with the guilty, and the kitchen sink of all bad conduct is admissible as evidence."</p>

<p>The Mississippi Legislature's attempt to focus prosecution on gang membership over the criminal acts themselves is "15 years behind" the times, Noblet said. He pointed to attempts to push such laws in cities such as Los Angeles that have now turned to different approaches. "Violence is not a gang problem, which is why we're not anti-gang. We are anti-violence," he said.</p>

<p>That shift in criminal-justice approach to both gangs and violence is widespread today, in no small part because only a small percentage of gang and crew members actually commit the violent crime.</p>

<p>"Ninety percent of the time they can be changed, or changed to allies," Noblet said. "Ten percent of the time, they need to have asses locked up or killed. If the other 90 percent are wasting away in jail, they're not there to help families, and they give up and sit on corners doing nothing. It's a waste of human potential."</p>

<p>That is consistent across the country, crime experts say. Many young people join gangs to belong to something, or because they are growing up in miserable situations, often raised (or not raised) by parents caught in generational poverty, addiction or crime themselves. They want a "family."</p>

<p>Need for Counter-Intelligence</p>

<p>Sociologist and crime expert Andrew V. Papachristos, now of Northwestern University in Chicago and previously with Yale, authored a research report analyzing Chicago's version of "Operation Ceasefire," a "focused deterrence" strategy that the BOTEC report also recommended because it incorporates outreach and services for identified gang and crew members. It also specifically targets violence over gang membership, at least when done according to plan.</p>

<p>Mississippi's SB 2868 makes no mention of crime prevention beyond policing, and the fusion gang assessment only asks two questions related to prevention at the very end that still focus on gang membership: "What prevention programs are in elementary and/or middle schools to offset the recruitment of youths into gangs?" and "What methods do mental health facilities have in place for monitoring the gang presence in their facilities?"</p>

<p>In a 2015 report published by the American Society of Criminology, Papachristos along with David S. Kirk of Oxford University discussed the importance of focusing enforcement on the violence itself and who specifically is committing it.</p>

<p>"The underlying principle is to reach those factions that are involved in shootings, rather than simply reaching out to gang members writ large," they wrote.</p>

<p>"Unlike general deterrence, which aims to dissuade the general population from engaging in particular criminal behaviors by increasing the severity, certainty and swiftness of punishments associated with said crime, focused deterrence posits that crime reduction is best achieved by concentrating deterrence efforts on those groups or individuals involved directly in the targeted type of crime," the report stated.</p>

<p>"Rather than enact broad-sweeping policies that indiscriminately apply across populations and places, focused deterrence efforts honor traditional deterrence principles while leveraging existing policies and practices in innovative ways directly toward small offending populations."</p>

<p>The report emphasizes that those violent offenders are a very small percentage of the people identifying in some way with a gang, crew or other group, so the emphasis on gang membership can be a waste of time and resources.</p>

<p>Such gang enforcement can also increase crime and violence, studies show. A major reason, Noblet said, is that rounding up suspects who are merely associated with a gang but not involved in crime creates massive distrust among the very people police need to help them with intelligence gathering. He using military strategy to train cops and critique SB 2868: The proposed gang bill is more of an "anti-terrorism" approach, he said. "You go in and go after the assholes." Innocent people may be caught up, but at least you found the bomb.</p>

<p>Street violence, though, requires more sophisticated counter-intelligence, he said, which "targets good guys to protect."</p>

<p>"One of the basic ways to protect them is to start treating the good guys as human. ... It takes a long time to develop trust. You get the good population to separate themselves to separate themselves from embedded bad guys." Then it's easier to spot the shooters, and the good ones might help you find them. "That's targeted suppression," he said.</p>

<p>Focusing on the violence itself has a better chance of working, the experts say, especially since young people have formed and hung out with gangs throughout history with many of the early gangs, whether Italians and Irish fighting in New York City in the 1800s or the Gangsters, Latin Kings and Simon City Royals starting up decades ago in Chicago to rumble over racial turf. Today, though, most gang violence is intra-gang, Papachristos and Kirk say—meaning over beefs, rules or women rather than the inter-gang turf wars of old.</p>

<p>Communities must come together in a systemic way that goes far beyond policing to target the violence, such as that embraced by the Urban Peace Institute and recommended in the BOTEC report on Jackson gangs, Noblet said. That means intervention, prevention, targeted policing and re-entry all at once. "When you approach it that way, you start dealing with the real causes of violence," Noblet said. "It starts in the womb: poor education, too many drugs, lack of good transportation, lack of a way to afford clothes and food."</p>

<p>To reverse those violent cycles—and perhaps the desire to join a gang in the first place—Noblet emphasized that police should be at the table, but not at the head of it. He prefers to see a municipal authority take the lead, bringing nonprofit groups, ex-gang members and people willing to work with them, as well as law enforcement, to the table to plan a long-term strategy to reverse violence. "There's nothing wrong with police as police," he said. "They are trained to take charge. Civilians are trained to back off when police are present."</p>

<p>In addition, Noblet said, "good and effective policing requires a series of questions and answers based upon understanding human nature and understanding the facts. Threats and fear are counter-productive 90 percent of the time."</p>

<p>Costs of Suppression</p>

<p>The backers of SB 2868—and media friendly to their approach—seem to spend more time trying to convince the public that "gangs are a problem!" in Mississippi rather than focusing on the causes and potential solutions that go far beyond—or come before—gang enforcement. Noblet started his interview saying that communities need to accept that they have gangs; he is not even fond of dividing them into groups, crews and cliques. And he is cynical about why people deny that their communities have gangs: "People are afraid tourists won't visit and spend money," he said.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that gangs of some kind are in every community and county in Mississippi—whether street gang, white supremacist or a neighborhood group harassing other kids. A small proportion of their members can be violent, especially ones who have been through hell and have no strong role models or hope for the future.</p>

<p>But criminalizing being in the gang itself will not stop that violence, Noblet and other experts emphasize, nor is it likely to deter the ones most likely to commit violence. "There is nothing that law enforcement can do to them that has not already been done to them by their relatives," Noblet said of the young people prone to committing the worst crimes.</p>

<p>Not to mention, sending them to prison can turn them into worse criminals as the BOTEC analysis reports pointed out. And the younger they are when they're arrested, the more likely they will commit worse crime as an adult. The other top precursor for committing adult crime is dropping out of school.</p>

<p>By Stephen Wilson</p>

<p>The populations of most prisons, including in Mississippi, are organized into gangs—for protection. Many gang members are "blessed in"—or "beat in"—in prison, and come out far worse criminals. This is why smart re-entry preparation needs to be in place for those leaving prison. Many former gangsters say they came out of prison and had nothing to do on the streets—no job, no transportation—and returned to crime as a result. And many experienced violence inside prison and then bring the habit, and the trauma, back home.</p>

<p>Still, "most of the time, re-entry is ignored," Noblet said.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Legislature has grappled with legislation that would increase re-entry options and resources in the state, but it stalled last session. And the backers of the gang bill are so focused on sending gangsters to prison for longer periods that they talk little about what happens when they come back to their communities.</p>

<p>Ironically, both the harsh gang enforcement and the lack of re-entry may prevent one of the top ways to reduce both gang activity and violence in communities, Babe Howell of CUNY Law said.</p>

<p>"Harsh penalties and gang suppression have strengthened gangs because it disrupts the normal process of maturing out of gangs and moving on to work and family," she said. "Chicago and California have long histories of gang suppression and MS-13 crackdowns; these experiences suggest that gang suppression by law enforcement is not a means of eliminating or even weakening gangs."</p>

<p>Howell suggests setting up systems of "violence interrupters"—former criminals and gang members who want to help young people choose better options than they did, as happens in an organized way now in many American cities.</p>

<p>"Cure Violence models that focus on working with at-risk kids using credible messengers (often former gang members or convicts who have lost years of their lives and loved ones to violence) seem to have robust impact without reliance on expensive incarceration which merely delays problems rather than resolving them," she said.</p>

<p>"The bills being proposed in Mississippi would prevent former gang members from doing violence-interruption work or returning to communities and working with at-risk youth," Howell said.</p>

<p>She added that the gang bill can also be costly if lawmakers do not take into account the cost of imprisoning many more people based on guilt by association.</p>

<p>"I don't see a budget analysis, but the cost to taxpayers is likely to be great," Howell warned about the proposed gang bill.</p>

<p>"An individual might sell drugs or be involved in an assault that is related to their group affiliation, and the sentence for the assault might be two years, but a gang enhancement could elevate it by five to 15 years." Then taxpayers foot the bill.</p>

<p>Costs of Suppression</p>

<p>Lawmakers in both the Mississippi House and Senate asked about a fiscal note for the legislation due to presumed extra costs for the Department of Corrections to incarcerate more convicted gang members.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Legislature passed a massive criminal-justice reform measure, House Bill 585, which was supposed to save the state money and decrease the number of men and women in custody.</p>

<p>The plan worked in the first year after HB 585 became law, with the number of inmates dropping by 11 percent. In the second year, however, the prison population began to climb again.</p>

<p>In 2013, MDOC had nearly 23,000 men and women behind bars, but hit a low point around summer 2015, with about 17,000 inmates. Since then, that number has edged up again.</p>

<p>Currently, there are 18,946 inmates in custody in Mississippi; with inmates in community corrections and other programs, that number is up to 20,738.</p>

<p>Another 32,796 Mississippians are on probation or parole. Black inmates make up 62 percent of the total number of offenders, while white inmates make up only 36 percent of the total population. More than 40 percent of men and women are behind bars in Mississippi are incarcerated for drug or property crimes.</p>

<p>Sen. Wiggins, though, does not believe his gang bill will increase costs.</p>

<p>"It's more about intensity than volume, and as you know, I've been a staunch defender of the criminal justice reform that this body and this Legislature passed... So, no, I don't think it will negligibly affect that," Wiggins said.</p>

<p>Simmons asked Wiggins to join him to request a fiscal note on the bill, citing reforms lawmakers passed previously that ended up "stacking the population" instead of lowering costs. At press time, no fiscal note was attached to Senate Bill 2868.</p>

<p>It is time for lawmakers to actually use the data and research they have asked for to implement criminal-justice reforms in the state. Photo courtesy Flickr/Neil Conway</p>

<p>Four years ago, the Legislature patted itself on the back for reforming Mississippi's criminal-justice system with sweeping legislation that was arguably one of the most impactful pieces of public policy passed in recent years. And they should have. Bipartisan efforts to empty prisons of nonviolent offenders are worthy of celebration. But passing House Bill 585 was only the beginning. Now it's time to implement those changes.</p>

<p>A huge part of criminal-justice reform requires paying particular attention to recidivism and re-entry programming around the state. How easy is it for former inmates to get housing, transportation, identification and jobs? In Mississippi, not easy at all. That is part of why the 2014 criminal-justice reform legislation created different task forces and committees of people who get together and work on these ideas. Three years later, those committees have reports, ideas and plans to implement several reforms statewide.</p>

<p>Now it is time for lawmakers and the governor to listen and implement those plans.</p>

<p>"While agreeing that several recommendations from earlier reports should be republished, the task force believed the report should emphasize the need for reinvestment in programs for persons post release," the 2017 report from the Corrections and Criminal Justice Task Force says.</p>

<p>Legislation to open up drug courts as re-entry courts died this session already, despite the task force recommending them. Alternatively, lawmakers are considering creating an additional penalty for criminal gang activity, as a proposed deterrent to gang involvement across the state, a proposal that will likely have the opposite effect on the state's prison population than House Bill 585 had. Criminal-justice reforms must be considered cohesively and comprehensively, and technically lawmakers have a lot left to implement from House Bill 585, with little appetite or even awareness that they need to.</p>

<p>The Legislature has figured out the solution to most of its problems is to sic a committee on them. Lottery? Education funding formula? Religious exemptions for vaccines? A committee can fix that. This does not mean we disapprove of studying topics and getting clear evidence-based data to base policy off on—in fact, we encourage that. But once the committee has done its hard work and presented data and recommendations, why on earth would you cherry-pick the results, or worse yet, have to be lobbied to legislate recommendations you asked for as lawmakers in the first place?</p>

<p>It is time for lawmakers to actually use the data and research they have asked for to implement criminal-justice reforms in the state.</p>

<p>It appears that JPD is in line with the national trend of engaging in character assassinations of victims of extra-judicial killings. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>Adofo Minka</p>

<p>It has been more than two weeks since two Jackson Police Department officers extra-judicially killed beloved daughter, mother and Jackson State University student Crystaline Barnes. The community waits in suspense for some facts on what happened on Jan. 27, 2018.</p>

<p>JPD has been less than forthcoming regarding basic information concerning this shooting. Instead, Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore, a man whom Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba lauded for being familiar with the national trends in criminal justice, has employed a tight-lipped approach eerily similar to those used in cases involving the extra-judicial killings of unarmed black men, women and children nationally.</p>

<p>Instead of offering transparency, Moore refuses to identify the officers or discuss whether they have histories of misconduct. This basic information should not be a mystery to residents. Barnes' killing by a hail of bullets while driving makes clear the importance of knowing the types of officers we have occupying our communities. The stray bullets and Barnes' car, which went out of control after the officers shot her, placed the lives and property of others in direct danger. JPD ought to know better. It is unacceptable that while Barnes' family mourns her killing, officers get a paid vacation free of any public scrutiny or ridicule, both of which are warranted.</p>

<p>Moore refuses to discuss JPD's use-of-force policy in any detail. This is a policy that the general public should know about. Further, residents of Jackson should have had the right to discuss and critique this policy publicly before it went into effect, as it directly impacts all residents. This is a basic issue of transparency. There is no excuse for Moore's refusal to provide such information to the public. There is no excuse why JPD has failed to do so in the past. What is in that policy that the department feels it has to hide? Does such a policy even exist? A failure to provide such basic information is a breach of the public trust.</p>

<p>It appears that JPD is in line with the national trend of engaging in character assassinations of victims of extra-judicial killings. Great emphasis has been placed on allegations that Barnes attempted to run someone off the road before her deadly encounter with officers. These allegations have yet to be substantiated in any concrete manner. JPD should have answered questions the allegations before releasing any statements regarding Barnes' alleged criminal behavior prior to her death, as well as a blurry mugshot of her. Moore should extend the same respect to Barnes and her family that has been afforded to the officers who killed her. This is JPD's attempt to control the narrative around her death.</p>

<p>The Clarion-Ledger reported that she had been in a Pre-Trial Diversion program and had outstanding traffic fines. But Barnes' prior criminal history has nothing to do with her extra-judicial killing. This is further character assassination and serves no other purpose other than to replace her cloak of innocence with a cloak of guilt.</p>

<p>A quick Internet search reveals that there have been seven JPD-officer-involved shootings that local media reported since November 2017. Two of these resulted in extra-judicial killings. Two resulted in officers wounding people. Luckily no one was harmed in the others. The number of officer-involved shootings in such a short period of time proves that there needs be closer scrutiny placed on JPD officers' use of force.</p>

<p>Barnes' killing should serve as a call to demand more transparency and accountability. The fact that JPD is investigating itself is unacceptable. It is akin to expecting the fox to investigate what happened in the hen house after he has ravaged it. The Hinds County District Attorney's Office investigating the matter to determine whether any charges will be brought against the officers is also unacceptable. The office depends on JPD to aid in its prosecution of cases, so it is biased and should recuse itself.</p>

<p>Residents need to demand that the city require a true independent investigation. Moore needs to release the names of the officers involved in all of the officer-involved shootings since November. JPD needs to release a clear statement outlining its policies concerning officer-involved shootings. The City of Jackson must establish a human-rights charter and a commission that gives an independent elected body with subpoena and investigative powers to address human-rights abuses in the city.</p>

<h2 id="opinionantigangactwouldbeadisasterformississippi">OPINION: Anti-Gang Act Would Be a Disaster for Mississippi</h2>

<p>by: Blake Feldman</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-07</p>

<p>url: http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2018/feb/07/anti-gang-act-would-be-disaster-mississippi/ </p>

<p>If signed into law, the Mississippi Anti-Gang Act (House Bill 541 and Senate Bill 2868) would be a civil liberty, fiscal and moral disaster. It is bad policy by any metric.</p>

<p>This legislation has been proposed for several sessions now (House Bill 1371 and Senate Bill 2027 in 2017, SB 2206 in 2016), and each year its proponents are not able to provide more than anecdotal evidence that gangs are a growing problem nor that the legislation would help address an alleged gang problem.</p>

<p>This session, the purported evidence of a gang problem is based on a survey where law enforcement named gangs in their jurisdictions. Nationwide, gang policing is scrutinized as racially bias and rife with due-process violations—especially regarding the low standards many departments use before labeling someone a gang member. If the legislature haphazardly passes the Mississippi Anti-Gang Act, dramatically broadening the legal definition of “gang members” and attaching parole ineligibility as a term of sentence, it will be contrary to a bipartisan effort to reduce Mississippi’s prison population.</p>

<p>The gang-policing practices that this legislation promotes have devastated innocent black and Latino children across the country. What has become abundantly clear is that gang policing without oversight entangles far too many innocent residents, especially residents of color. In 2016, the California state auditor found the state’s gang database to be remarkably inaccurate, so much so that it included 42 people who were babies when law enforcement labeled them as gang members. Rather than paving the way for local and state agencies to find themselves embroiled in a similar scandal, our legislature should ensure these civil-liberty concerns are addressed on the front end.</p>

<p>Most criminologists and policing experts who are advocates of targeted gang suppression note that it has to be one piece of a larger strategy to address violent crime, and a comprehensive approach is worth discussing in Mississippi. However, using subjective data as evidence of a gang problem, legislating an overly broad and vague definition for gang members, and attaching more prison time for people convicted of gang activity is hardly a balanced and reasoned approach. The Mississippi Anti-Gang Act flies in the face of recent legislative efforts to reduce our unsustainable prison population—which is currently the fourth highest per capita in the country.</p>

<p>Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, did not want to debate the "anti-gang" bill for long this morning, and after about half an hour, he tabled House Bill 541, noting that the Senate had already passed its version of the legislation. Gipson will likely take up that bill when it comes over to the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>His motivation for the legislation, Gipson said, comes from reading the State Gang Threat Assessment, which is based on gang data that 71 law-enforcement agencies submitted on questionnaires at the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators Conference in 2017.</p>

<p>Some representatives requested to see the study, as they had not seen it before the bill came to the floor.</p>

<p>Policing Gang Membership Over Violence?</p>

<p>Brad Rowe was a lead researcher on the 2016 Botec Analysis study of Jackson crime, including a "Gang Violence Assessment" for Hinds County, for which the Mississippi Legislature paid $500,000. After reading the more recent gang assessment, which the Department of Homeland Security provided to the Jackson Free Press, Rowe warned that focusing too much on gang membership can be shortsighted.</p>

<p>"Reading the assessment," he said Wednesday in a phone interview from Los Angeles, "they're clearly going after this idea of 'gang.' One thing we've learned outside of Jackson is that it's much more helpful for authorities, whether law enforcement or government organizations doing mental health, to go after violence rather than gangs."</p>

<p>Adding that he is not a "hug-a-thug," Rowe, the former BOTEC CEO who now runs RPM Policy and Media in Los Angeles, continued, "The concept of criminalizing gang members ... is not all good. They do serve a function. A lot of kids don't have families that support them and don't feel that they're safe. Gangs are a way to have a group that protects you, stands by you. Yes, sometimes they ask you to do stuff outside of the law, and they're going to do it."</p>

<p>Other crime experts echo the advice of focusing on violence over criminalizing gang membership itself, which can take a lot of resources for a small yield over time, especially since marginal gang members can come out of prison as more hardened gangsters and criminals.</p>

<p>Sociologist and crime expert Andrew V. Papachristos, now of Northwestern University in Chicago and previously with Yale, authored a research report analyzing Chicago's version of "Operation Ceasefire," a popular violence intervention that focuses on violence over gang membership. In the 2015 report published by the American Society of Criminology, Papachristos along with David S. Kirk of Oxford University discussed the importance of focusing enforcement on the violence itself and who specifically is committing it. "The underlying principle is to reach those factions that are involved in shootings, rather than simply reaching out to gang members writ large," they wrote.</p>

<p>"Unlike general deterrence, which aims to dissuade the general population from engaging in particular criminal behaviors by increasing the severity, certainty and swiftness of punishments associated with said crime, focused deterrence posits that crime reduction is best achieved by concentrating deterrence efforts on those groups or individuals involved directly in the targeted type of crime. Rather than enact broad-sweeping policies that indiscriminately apply across populations and places, focused deterrence efforts honor traditional deterrence principles while leveraging existing policies and practices in innovative ways directly toward small offending populations."</p>

<p>Often, those violent offenders are a very small percentage of the people identifying in some way with a gang, crew or other group, the report explains.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Senate's legislation would expand the definition of a gang in state law, broadening the net rather than focusing it, and make "criminal gang activity" an additional penalty for felonies committed if a district attorney proves they are a part of a gang, in addition to whatever underlying offense a person committed.</p>

<p>That effort makes Rowe nervous, including for law enforcement trying to stop violence in communities. "The more that the establishment goes after this concept of 'gang' rather than going after violence, the more the gang members distrust the system," he said. That means that young people can be less likely to tell the cops when they are in danger or to report crimes they see. And that reticence can extend to community and family members who want the violence to stop, but do not want young people's future ruined by over-criminalization for simply showing an association to a gang at some point.</p>

<p>"They want appropriate policing in their neighborhoods," Rowe said of communities often targeted by gang sweeps, "but don't want neighborhoods to be over-policed. It's hard."</p>

<p>BOTEC researchers also warned that one of the top two precursors for a young person committing worse crime as an adult is being put into the criminal-system system as a juvenile.</p>

<p>The Potential for Profiling</p>

<p>House Democrats had a lot of questions about the measure, and brought up examples of sorority and fraternity members, or teammates on a sports team potentially being targeted as "gangs" if the legislation becomes law.</p>

<p>"Law enforcement would have to look at that and determine whether in fact this is a gang or a group of young people," Gipson told Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, who asked about a group of kids with similar tattoos or wearing the same colors.</p>

<p>Bell brought up racial profiling in his questions.</p>

<p>"In today's climate with racial profiling, and individuals being shot and murdered by police officers, do you not understand my concern about this?" Bell asked Gipson.</p>

<p>"I don't agree that there's racial profiling going on, gentleman. I know that there have been instances ... ," Gipson said.</p>

<p>"Well, gentleman, be black for a day, and find out. It happens," Bell said.</p>

<p>Rowe also addressed the profiling potential of overly broad gang laws and enforcement strategies that give law enforcement and prosecutors the discretion to bring additional charges. "First of all, it's a PR nightmare for law enforcement. All these stories are going to come out," he said. Communities and the young people themselves will ask why police are targeting young people in neighborhoods, middle schools, high schools, even if some are involved in bad activity. "Criminalizing being poor black youth in Jackson. That's the story, and all people are going to hear." That, in turn, will be counter-productive to building trust and curbing the violence, he said.</p>

<p>When reminded that proponents of the gang bill would point out that it would also target the Simon City Royals, a white gang, Rowe said that fact does not change the underlying problem with such broad enforcement. "That's equal-opportunity suppression. Not just going after black boys, but white kids who are bad kids, too. (Law enforcement) can use the color of law to take down white kids as well," he said.</p>

<p>Gipson opted to table the bill, letting it die on today's deadline, noting that the Senate passed a version of the bill yesterday. The House will have to debate the "ant-gang" bill again later in the session.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Feb. 7, the Senate passed the gang legislation from Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, over significant resistance from Democrats.</p>

<p>Sen. John Horhn, D-Jackson, shared his reservations about the legislation, telling Wiggins that in some neighborhoods—or even in prison—a person might join a gang for self-protection.</p>

<p>"I'm concerned about some of the unintended consequences of doing this," Horhn told Wiggins on Wednesday during debate.</p>

<p>The BOTEC researchers found that self-protection was a factor for gangs in Jackson, as it is around the country. Rowe said that, under the extended gang laws, a young person might be a Facebook friend with someone who commits a violent act. That young person does not turn him in, perhaps because he is afraid of retaliation, and the law could justify charging him. "Are you then complicit in the crime? Involved in the cover-up? I don't know," he said.</p>

<p>Rowe emphasized that understanding and treating trauma is key to preventing youth violence, whether gang-related or not. "The violent kids have often been abused physically, mentally, sexually and neglected," he said. "Somewhere in there they didn't get the tools to deal with that trauma and anger. They are then sent to schools where, if they have discipline problems, they're treated like prisoners."</p>

<p>The BOTEC report on gangs endorsed a targeted "Operation Ceasefire" approach to gang enforcement as well and laid out a model for countering gang violence based on the Urban Peace Institute's Programs for Gang Intervention.</p>

<p>Sen. Derrick Simmons, D-Greenville, offered an amendment to putting a measure in the bill that would force it into conference between senators and representatives. His amendment failed, and the Senate passed Senate Bill 2868 by a vote of 35-14. The bill is held on a motion to reconsider, which the Senate must lift by Monday for the measure to advance.</p>

<p>Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps proposed a change to Jackson's ordinances at a Jan. 30 meeting that would decriminalize possession of user-level amounts of marijuana. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps proposed a change to Jackson's ordinances last week that would decriminalize possession of user-level amounts of marijuana. The public can attend a hearing at 6 p.m. today at City Hall for citizens to voice their concerns and ask questions.</p>

<p>If the ordinance passes, those in Jackson in possession of 30 grams of marijuana or less would pay a fine of no more than $100 and not serve any prison time. Prescription marijuana would not be subject to these same penalties in the City ordinances.</p>

<p>"We're introducing this to decriminalize user level amounts of marijuana because for far too long we have made a practice of turning users into criminals," Stamps said at the Jackson City Council meeting on Jan. 30.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Code enforces punishments for marijuana possession of 30 grams or less by a fine of $100 to $250 with no jail time for the first offense. However, a second conviction for simple possession within two years is a misdemeanor carrying the punishment of a $250 fine, no more than 60 days in the county jail and mandatory enrollment in a drug-education program approved by the Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse of the State Department of Mental Health, unless a court finds this inappropriate. Any subsequent conviction after that within two years merits a fine between $250 and $1,000 and up to six months in county jail.</p>

<p>If a person operating a motor vehicle possesses up to 30 grams of marijuana, he or she would face a misdemeanor charge, and if convicted, would face a maximum fine of $1,000, up to 90 days in county jail or both.</p>

<p>Stamps' ordinance does not address how the City will handle second-time offenders of simple possession laws or when drivers carry 30 ounces or less of marijuana.</p>

<p>Councilman Stamps is targeting Jackson's ordinances, which are "presently silent," as he characterized them, on punishing simple possession within Jackson's city limits. The current ordinances about simple possession only say that no person charged with possession of one ounce or less would face the punishments for those violating the City's drug-paraphernalia ordinances.</p>

<p>City ordinances include an extensive list of illegal items considered to be drug paraphernalia that can be used for planting, growing, preparing, manufacturing or ingesting outlawed substances. Persons violating these paraphernalia ordinances are subject to a fine not to exceed $500, city jail time up to 90 days or both.</p>

<p>The new proposed ordinance also suggests training for the Jackson Police Department to learn the difference between the proposed City ordinance and State law.</p>

<p>"Whereas, the City Council finds that it is in the City's best interest to provide local law enforcement with the ability to charge individuals in simple possession of marijuana with an offense that neither unfairly stigmatizes the offender(s), nor creates an undue burden on the City in regards to jail costs," Stamps' introduction of the ordinance reads.</p>

<p>A 2013 American Civil Liberties Union study on the racial disparities of criminalizing marijuana showed that although blacks and whites use marijuana pretty much equally, blacks are 3.73 times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession. The study also says enforcing marijuana laws can cost $3.6 billion annually.</p>

<p>Jennifer Riley-Collins, the executive director of the ACLU of Mississippi, spoke at the meeting, commending Stamps, while offering ways the ordinance could be improved so that fines will not lock poorer people into a debtors' prison scheme.</p>

<p>"(The proposed ordinance) could potentially be plagued with the same selective enforcement woes as marijuana criminal laws, and those unable to pay fines could face arrest and imprisonment," Riley-Collins said to the council. "We therefore ask in its implementation that the City of Jackson ensure that those who cannot afford to pay the associated fine because of indigence are not penalized for being poor...."</p>

<p>JACKSON — Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps proposed a change to Jackson's ordinances that would decriminalize possession of user-level amounts of marijuana.</p>

<p>If the ordinance passes, those in Jackson with possession of 30 grams of marijuana or less would be fined no more than $100 and would not be sent to prison for any term. Prescription marijuana would not be subject to these same penalties, however.</p>

<p>"We're introducing this to decriminalize user level amounts of marijuana because for far too long we have made a practice of turning users into criminals," Stamps said at the council meeting on Jan. 30.</p>

<p>The ordinance also suggests training for the Jackson Police Department to learn the difference between the proposed City ordinance and State law. The City will hold a public hearing before the ordinance shows up on the next agenda for the council meeting on Feb. 13 at 10 a.m.</p>

<p>State law enforces punishments for marijuana possession of 30 grams or less by a fine of $100-$250.</p>

<p>Stamps wants the City legislation to halt the pipeline that begins with low-level arrests for possession, for instance, and sends people into a life of crime, gangs, and ultimately prison instead of into higher-level education.</p>

<p>Those who spoke at the meeting, including the mayor, complimented Stamps for his work to get on board with the movement to decriminalize marijuana so that law enforcement can focus on worse crimes such as murders, opioids and big-time drug suppliers.</p>

<p>"I have never used marijuana," Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said. "But, I believe that the detrimental impact of criminalizing individuals for simple usage for something that has shown that it has far less detrimental impact than many of the things that we consume everyday, legally, is the wrong way to go."</p>

<h2 id="unnamedofficersonpaidleaveforshootingof21yearolddriver">Unnamed Officers on Paid Leave for Shooting of 21-Year-Old Driver</h2>

<p>Interim Police Chief Anthony Moore promised a "thorough" investigation into Crystaline Barnes' death. (Photo from separate press conference held on Jan. 29 not at police department.) File Photo. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Early Saturday morning, two Jackson police officers shot at 21-year-old Crystaline Barnes during a traffic stop in response to a report that Barnes may have forced another motorist off the roadway, but is so far only providing vague information about the deadly incident as well as whether its use-of-force policy for moving vehicles meets national guidelines.</p>

<p>JPD also did not confirm whether Barnes died of a gunshot or from the collision soon afterward, saying only that she was "fatally wounded." The department has, so far, refused to name the officers who fired into the moving vehicle, who are now on paid leave, but has implied that the deceased young woman may have a criminal history. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice advised police departments to release names of officers involved in critical events, including shootings, within 72 hours of the incident.</p>

<p>Jackson Police Department spokesman Roderick Holmes said the officer that made the stop in the 1400 block of Fernwood Drive called an additional unit for assistance. Barnes allegedly pulled away and did a U-turn "to evade the responding unit," Holmes said in a statement Saturday.</p>

<p>"(Barnes) later stops and began driving in reverse toward that officer who had exited the patrol vehicle just prior," the statement reads. "The officer then discharged their weapon into the vehicle before safely jumping out of its path and the suspect's vehicle collided with the patrol vehicle."</p>

<p>Then Holmes said Barnes drove toward the other officer, who also discharged his or her weapon into the vehicle. That's when Barnes collided with a nearby utility pole just off the roadway.</p>

<p>Both officers are on administrative leave with pay as the internal criminal investigation unfolds. No outside firms are helping with the investigation, but interim Police Chief Anthony Moore said at a press conference at the police department today that Hinds County District Attorney Robert Shuler Smith's office has been involved with the investigation from the outset. At the conclusion of the investigation, a Hinds County grand jury will decide on the facts and whether the officers will face trial, he said.</p>

<p>While the JPD has not released the names of the officers involved in the shooting or even a definite cause of death, Holmes did sent out a blurry, disheveled photo of Barnes that appears to be a mugshot, hinting at but not confirming that the deceased woman had been in trouble before.</p>

<p>Moore would not say if the officers had been in police-involved situations in the past, saying he did not want to talk about personnel issues. He also said JPD's lethal-force policy depends on the situation and that officers have to gauge the situation to determine whether they need to use deadly force.</p>

<p>The approach of giving officers wide discretion on whether to fire into a moving vehicle is not considered a national best practice for policing, however. The Police Executive Research Forum released a report in March 2016, "Guiding Principles on Use of Force," warning about the high dangers of shooting into moving vehicles. The report discusses the New York Police Department's reversal of the moving-vehicles policy, especially after the death of Sean Bell there, and the effect it has had on police use of force there.</p>

<p>"For example, more than 40 years ago, the New York City Police Department adopted a prohibition on officers shooting at or from a moving vehicle, unless a person in the vehicle is using or threatening deadly force by means other than the vehicle itself. That NYPD policy, adopted in 1972, resulted in an immediate, sharp reduction in uses of lethal force in New York City. Police shooting incidents declined from nearly 1,000 a year in 1972 to 665 the following year, and have fallen steadily ever since, to fewer than 100 per year today," the report stated.</p>

<p>Police officers shooting into moving vehicles has drawn national scrutiny in the United States due to the dangers it poses and not only to the driver. Law-enforcement experts warn that not only the targeted driver be injured or killed, but that an out-of-control vehicle then poses dangers to both the officers as well as bystanders and property. Officers should "move" out of the path of moving vehicles, policing experts advise, if at all possible and then follow specific procedures that should be part of their training.</p>

<p>"If you're successful and shoot the driver, now you have an uncontrolled vehicle," Geoff Alpert, an expert in policing tactics at the University of South Carolina, told VOX. "And it's just as likely his foot is going to go on the gas as it is to not go on the gas."</p>

<p>The national Police Executive Research Forum points to federal case law that requires detailed use-of-force policies for shooting into vehicles, while advising departments to not allow it.</p>

<p>"In Graham v. Connor, the Supreme Court outlines broad principles on how police use of force is to be considered and judged. But the Court leaves it to individual police agencies to determine how best to incorporate those principles into their own policies and training, in order to direct officers on how to perform their duties on a daily basis. Graham v. Connor is the common denominator across the United States, and all police agencies must have use-of-force policies that meet Graham's standards. But many police departments have chosen to go beyond the bare requirements of Graham, by adopting more detailed policies and training on issues such as shooting at moving vehicles, rules on pursuits, guidelines on the use of Electronic Control Weapons ...," the forum's report stated.</p>

<p>The forum complains that many police departments, however, just ignore those federal standards, which The Washington Post reported has led to more than 200 deaths since 2017, including 15-year-old Jordan Edwards in a Dallas suburb. Often, departments get away with loose standards on firing into moving vehicles because the departments investigate themselves, as JPD said it plans to do here.</p>

<p>Still, the new police chief assured Jackson citizens that it will do the right thing in investigating its officers use of force.</p>

<p>"Again this is a tragedy, it is a real tragedy," Moore told reporters. "Nobody wins in this situation. It's very unfortunate, but I want to assure the family and I want to assure the public that this investigation is going to be fair, unbiased, and it's going to be thorough and complete for everyone that's involved."</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba says the City of Jackson will not back down from its anti-profiling ordinance, which the U.S. Justice Department, under Jeff Sessions’ lead, has taken issue with. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The City of Jackson's anti-profiling ordinance will stay on the books, as far as Chokwe A. Lumumba is concerned. The Mississippi Legislature targeted the 2010 ordinance as a "sanctuary city" policy in 2017, and now U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions' Justice Department has added the capital city to his list of 23 jurisdictions he believes could be violating federal laws that prohibit local or state governments from restricting communication between immigration services and government entities.</p>

<p>Now, Jackson police officers cannot ask about a person's immigration status unless it is in the course of a criminal investigation or necessary to assist federal law enforcement. The Justice Department has taken issue with this part of city code, however, and sent a second letter to the City last week threatening to subpoena documents as well as retract federal funds to the city.</p>

<p>Lumumba says the ordinance complies with federal law, however, and that it actually helps community-policing efforts across the city.</p>

<p>"Racial profiling is patently illegal," Lumumba told reporters Monday. "... Furthermore, racial profiling is ineffective. It alienates communities from law enforcement, disrupts community policing efforts, and causes law enforcement to forfeit credibility and trust among the people they are sworn to protect and serve."</p>

<p>Lumumba said if an undocumented immigrant is worried that police will ask about his or her immigration status, they are less likely to come forward if and when they are the victim of a crime or a key witness to one.</p>

<p>"Just as someone who is undocumented can be the perpetrator of a crime, we know that someone who is undocumented can be the victim of a crime—and often are victims of crimes, not only in our community but across the country," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>"We know that this is the case because we know that undocumented individuals often don't have identification. Therefore, they do not open bank accounts. Therefore, they often have great amounts of cash on them, and people know this and target them and look to abuse them in these circumstances, and that is not an environment or culture we want to promote."</p>

<p>In a Jan. 24, 2018, letter, the DOJ asked Jackson officials for all documents "reflecting any orders, directives, instructions, or guidance to your law enforcement employees."</p>

<p>Lumumba says those documents do not exist.</p>

<p>"Our response to the Department of Justice was that, first and foremost, we're in compliance with the law. The law that DOJ references is one about providing information obtained by law enforcement ... if we don't inquire about it, then we don't have information to provide. Therefore, we are in accordance with the law," Lumumba said.</p>

<p>If DOJ determines that Jackson is out of compliance with federal immigration laws, the City might have to return federal grant funds and possibly be deemed ineligible for police-department grants going forward. Lumumba said he has talked to organizations working with other cities around the country on the issue, which showed him that Jackson's ordinance is "really on the lighter end of things."</p>

<p>Uniting for DACA?</p>

<p>Immigrants and activists called on Mississippi lawmakers to support legislation that enables immigrants in the state to be eligible for in-state college tuition last week at a press conference.</p>

<p>Rep. Kathy Sykes, D-Jackson, said it is important to unite behind students with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, status and encourage Congress to support its reauthorization.</p>

<p>"On the state level, we have young people who have been here who have exceeded in their education; they've done very, very well. However, when they attempt to enroll in college, they have to pay out-of-state tuition, and that is patently unfair," Sykes said at the Capitol last week. "I have introduced a bill to change that, and hopefully we can gather enough support so these young people can continue on this productive and positive path they are on."</p>

<p>Sykes filed House Bill 33 to allow undocumented students or students with temporary visas to pay in-state tuition as long as they have a high-school diploma and have lived in Mississippi for five years or more in a row.</p>

<p>That bill died on Tuesday after the committee deadline. On the federal level, the negotiations on the DACA program and immigration reform continues, with President Donald Trump offering to extend DACA protections for millions of young people who came to the U.S. as kids in exchange for a multi-billion-dollar wall on the southern border. Immigrants' rights groups nationally have decried the president's proposal.</p>

<p>Ending Temporary Status</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that temporary protected status, or TPS, for Haitians will end by July 22, 2019. Additionally, the department is phasing out TPS for Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador. TPS is a program that enables people who have a natural or political disaster in their country to come to the U.S. and get work authorization. Patricia Ice, legal director of the Mississippi Immigrants Rights Alliance, says that ending TPS will affect people who came here from Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador back in 1999 and 2000. She said many of them have children and have started lives here, considering themselves Americans.</p>

<p>"The government is trying to deport these people. They have terminated several TPS programs for people from Central America, from Haiti and other countries, and we have to stop that," Ice said at the Capitol last week.</p>

<p>MIRA held the press conference to oppose House Bill 1506, which also died in committee on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The proposed bill would require law enforcement officers to inquire about a person's immigration status when they arrest them as well as penalize businesses who contract with undocumented workers.</p>

<p>JACKSON — The celebration was small, but the impact is likely to be large. On Friday, Jan. 26, nine local law enforcement officers who work in Hinds County graduated from week-long mental-health training to help them on the job.</p>

<p>Crisis Intervention Team training, or CIT for short, is an intensive program. Officers heard from professionals, learning about mental-health disorders, specific illnesses and how treatment works. They also learned de-escalation techniques and tools to use when confronting a person having a mental-health crisis, which can escalate into deadly encounters if handled poorly.</p>

<p>On the last two days, the graduates ran through live-action scenarios to practice what they learned. Hinds County sheriffs, Jackson Police Department officers, and several college campus and other police officers in the Jackson-Hinds area trained last week, as well as a handful of Mississippi Department of Corrections staff members.</p>

<p>This is the first group to graduate from with CIT certification in Hinds County. Law-enforcement officers in Lauderdale County and in Meridian have used CIT training for a while. Chief Deputy Ward Calhoun from Lauderdale County spoke to graduates before they got their certificates and pins last week. He told them CIT had to be a team effort, using a stool he brought with him to illustrate that local mental-health centers, organizations like National Alliance on Mental Illness and law enforcement must coordinate for CIT to work.</p>

<p>"In the long run, I think something really unique happens. Not only do you become a better CIT officer, you just become a better officer," Calhoun told the graduates. "You become a better person—that's what we're supposed to be doing. ... We ought to be the folks that the community turns to for a solution."</p>

<p>The ceremony officially marks a shift in how law enforcement and the mental-health sectors intersect in the city and county. In Hinds County, when any law-enforcement officer encounters a person she or he suspects is having a mental crisis, they call the mobile crisis team from Hinds Behavioral Health, the county's community mental-health center, to come to the scene.</p>

<p>Officers responding to calls or mobile crisis teams can now call a CIT-trained officer to help de-escalate the situation for a person in crisis, too. American Medical Response, the city and county emergency medic and ambulance provider, will be called to the scene to take the person to St. Dominic's Hospital to stabilize.</p>

<p>Merit Health Central agreed to provide overflow beds if needed.</p>

<p>In other words, Hinds County now has a flow chart and a single point of entry to coordinate mental-health care for those experiencing a crisis instead of that person spending a night or longer in jail when they need to be receiving care instead.</p>

<p>JPD Commander Herman Horton said Jackson has about eight CIT-trained officers and reminded the graduates of the oath they took as a part of the program.</p>

<p>"Bear in mind that when that phone rings, you're going to have to come because that's what you swore you would do when you graduated from this class," he said.</p>

<p>More Training Statewide</p>

<p>Attorney General Jim Hood is hoping training for law-enforcement officials expands statewide to prevent men and women with these issues from being incarcerated. He told the state mental-health task force last week that he wants for law-enforcement officers and professionals to get to know each other in communities.</p>

<p>"We're not only trying to de-escalate the situation but get law enforcement at those trainings (with) mental-health people ... so they can call once the situation is calmed down so they (people having crises) don't have to go to jail and cost the county or city money to house them, and they are put in a bed where they need to be," Hood said.</p>

<p>The problem for many Mississippians already charged with crimes who want to plead insanity or need mental evaluation is that only a handful of stabilization beds are available for them. The State has a 35-bed forensic unit at Mississippi State Hospital. Of those beds, 15 are used for men and women charged with crimes who need to be assessed for their competency to stand trial. The other 20 beds are for those Mississippians judges have deemed incompetent to stand trial. The building these people are held in is out of the last century.</p>

<p>"It's an antiquated facility with Yale locks on the doors," Hood said last week. "It's like you're walking back in the 1920s era. It's eerie."</p>

<p>Hood's experience echoes what psychiatrist Tom Recore told senators earlier this month when Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, held a hearing about the state's forensic unit. Recore told the Senate Judiciary B Committee that the unit needs a new building, and the Mississippi Department of Mental Health is working on locating a new space or seeing how much it will cost to renovate the current building.</p>

<p>Sen. Briggs Hopson, R-Vicksburg, authored the Forensic Mental Health Act, which the Senate could consider next week. The legislation would allow more providers to examine men and women charged with crimes who need mental-health evaluations. Currently, few providers besides the forensic unit at Whitfield can provide the courts with mental assessments. This legislation would allow courts to contract with more providers, certified by DMH, in addition to ensuring men and women with those needs maintain their constitutional rights.</p>

<p>'Elephant in the Room'</p>

<p>The state mental health task force is working to find ways to standardize the system of mental health care from county to county, but Hood emphasized the difficulties the committee will face without funding. The U.S. Department of Justice sued Mississippi in 2016 for its over-reliance on institutions to treat people with mental illnesses instead of treating them in the community. The lawsuit is still ongoing, and if federal and state officials cannot reach an agreement soon, the case will go to trial in early 2019. Hood blamed the Legislature for underfunding DMH for the lawsuit.</p>

<p>"I did end up getting to that point of addressing the kind of elephant in the room with all of us here, and that is funding," Hood said. "I don't anticipate having it. They're not going to do it because some federal court order is going to do it, and I got to defend the state until we get to that point."</p>

<p>DMH has not asked for additional funding in fiscal-year 2019, however, and the department has said it will move $10 million of its funds to community-based services if the amount it receives is the same as last fiscal year. Whether or not the Legislature will fund DMH at the level DMH requested remains to be seen.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Pearl Assistant Police Chief Dean Scott pulled out his phone in the Mississippi Capitol on Jan. 17 to show just how easy it is to solicit sex from likely trafficked girls just minutes down the road.</p>

<p>Scott pulled up Craigslist, a popular classified-advertising site that has drawn fire for allowing human-trafficking ads in the past, on his smartphone's browser. "You can buy anything from a car to a child on it," Scott said as the site opened. "She's in a motel right there on High Street," he said, turning his phone around to show an ad of a teenage girl who he sees on Craigslist every day. Her ad says she's 25, but Scott said she just turned 18.</p>

<p>A lawmaker asked why someone had not already gone to the spot to make an arrest as law enforcement knew what might be happening there. The revolving-door aspect of trafficking requires an inexhaustible effort that many lack the manpower to handle efficiently.</p>

<p>"Everyone I showed you was posted today," Scott told the Jackson Free Press after scrolling through a seemingly endless list of phone numbers to call for sex on Backpage and similar listings on Craigslist. Both companies have come under intense fire for allowing such ads, and both say they have removed the ads, with Craigslist at one point replacing its "Adults Services" link with "Censored."</p>

<p>"It's kind of like stamping out the flu. It's not going to happen—it's too much money," Scott said. "We're talking about a billion-dollar-a-year industry."</p>

<p>Still, had law enforcement gone to pick up the girl Scott showed to lawmakers before she turned 18, Child Protective Services may well not have come to the scene to retrieve the child, leaving officers with one option for her—juvenile detention centers.</p>

<p>If she were in a rural area, like much of the state, the chances of law enforcement even responding to a call gets even slimmer, Scott said, because they just don't have enough "boots on the ground." He estimates it takes around three or four officers to work a trafficking case.</p>

<p>Rural districts do not have much choice when they do not have the manpower to spend all night with the kids waiting for CPS to show up—and Scott is convinced that they almost never will. Those kids get turned over to a detention center, and subsequently youth court where a judge may sentence them for 30 days for disrupting the family peace by running away.</p>

<p>On one hand, Mississippi is credited with improving its "D"-rated sex trafficking laws in 2013 to receiving a "B" grade this year from Shared Hope International. However, law enforcement and professionals like Sandy Middleton of the Center for Violence Prevention in Pearl, who work to end trafficking, agree that Mississippi has work to do to stop trafficking.</p>

<p>Sold By Family</p>

<p>In Mississippi, family members often sell children in what Middleton calls "familial trafficking." Scott said it is not uncommon for him to see a grandfather "swapping his granddaughter for heroin."</p>

<p>"There may be a difficulty of a victim divulging that they're being trafficked by a parent or a family member, but I think they're all difficult situations," Middleton told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>The recent Mississippi trafficking laws that earned passing remarks say trafficking victims may not be prosecuted for prostitution, regardless of age. Traffickers are required to register as sex offenders and are required to pay restitution.</p>

<p>However, the law does not determine whose burden it is to uncover whether those charged with prostitution were first trafficked. In federal crackdown operations like Operation Cross Country executed nationwide, law enforcement often sweeps up prostitutes along with traffickers.</p>

<p>In October 2017, the Jackson Police Department arrested 13 individuals during the sweep here, charging 12 of them with prostitution and two of them with additional charges of possession of a firearm and possession of meth and heroin, respectively. The youngest woman arrested was 18 and the oldest 77. One woman's charges solely indicated she had "obstructed traffic."</p>

<p>Middleton said at the time, and emphasized her point again at the Capitol this month, that law-enforcement officers need to be trained to better handle these investigations because she believes it is best for them to handle everything, rather than depending on social entities like CPS.</p>

<p>"It's tough when you've got a kid, and nobody comes," Middleton said. "Just like a cop can't take them to the hospital; their hands are absolutely tied because of our laws."</p>

<p>More Training Needed</p>

<p>Scott is a member of the Central Mississippi Human Trafficking Task Force, but says he sources his motivation from his 8-year-old special-needs daughter.</p>

<p>"She's one of the girls, that when she gets 18, she is going to be easily influenced by someone ... showing her attention that she may not get," Scott told lawmakers at the Capitol.</p>

<p>Scott said the legislators must ensure that state agencies are doing what they're supposed to do—especially CPS.</p>

<p>"Because I promise you, I can put y'all in the Tahoe with me, we can go out at 2 in the morning," Scott said. "... We can get a child in one of these situations, we can call and say we need CPS, and I'll go buy y'all breakfast, and then we'll wait—they're not coming."</p>

<p>Notably, Sen. Sally Doty, R-Brookhaven, and Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, were in the room. Gipson killed Doty's domestic-abuse bill last legislative session in committee, not letting members vote on it, before a popular campaign brought the bill back up, and it passed. Middleton awarded Gipson and Doty the 2017 Angel of the Year award from the Center for Violence Prevention on Jan. 18.</p>

<p>Scott said that, often, CPS personnel do not want to go to dangerous locations. He gives the department an "F" in terms of their follow-through in these cases.</p>

<p>Middleton said the system works best when law enforcement handle the cases, especially with CPS' track record of not showing up.</p>

<p>"It just makes sense to us that law enforcement should investigate ... but we certainly want them to be trained to investigate," Middleton told the Jackson Free Press about trafficking in the state.</p>

<p>Beyond CPS, judges can have old-school mindsets about what constitutes trafficking, and if they are not trained to learn the differences between sex work and trafficking, the cycle will never end, Scott said.</p>

<p>"So just like the training we're trying to get for law enforcement, the patrol guys, investigators—these judges need it to," Scott said. "We've got judges on the bench that have no idea what we're bringing them. They think a 15-year-old is a prostitute because that's what she wants to do."</p>

<h2 id="antigangbillheadstofullhousetoexpandpolicingpowers">'Anti-Gang' Bill Heads to Full House to Expand Policing Powers</h2>

<p>by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-26</p>

<p>JACKSON — Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, called the "Mississippi Anti-Gang Act" one of the most significant pieces of legislation the Legislature could pass in 2018. The bill would make "criminal gang activity" a separate offense from any underlying misdemeanor or felony a person is accused of if prosecutors can prove they are gang members.</p>

<p>The new act, a version of an expanded "gang" law that failed last session, would make it easier for law enforcement and prosecutors to label a suspect as a gang member and less challenging to prove he or she is part of a larger conspiracy, thus drawing additional prison times tacked on to time served for specific crimes they might commit. Law enforcement often use the controversial threat of additional charges and prison time as a way to get suspected gang members to testify against other ones.</p>

<p>Jimmy Anthony, a regional vice president of the Mississippi Association of Gang Investigators who has been lobbying for the expanded gang law for at least two sessions now, told lawmakers that gangs are active in all 82 counties in Mississippi.</p>

<p>"The biggest concern we have is how the adult gang members are using our children to commit these crimes because of the opportunity for lesser sentencing, and of course, the older gang members themselves are benefitting," Anthony told the House Judiciary B Committee this morning.</p>

<p>The solution in House Bill 541 appears to be adding an extra offense for being associated with a so-called "gang" with language that makes it easier to categorize a suspect as being part of a criminal gang, giving authorities more leverage to get them to talk or to bring additional charges.</p>

<p>Assessing, Using Uneven 'Gang' Numbers</p>

<p>Lora Hunter, an attorney for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, told lawmakers about a recent gang assessment conducted statewide. She said 125 law enforcement agencies participated in the study conducted by the Mississippi Fusion Center, a subdivision of the state's Homeland Security office and DPS. Hunter said the assessment revealed 46 of the most prevalent gangs in the state, with the well-known Vice Lords, Gangster Disciples and Simon City Royals topping that list.</p>

<p>The study itself, which Homeland Security provided to the Jackson Free Press this week, is filled with self-reported numbers from agencies around the state. The various police agencies may or may not use consistent data for who is actually a member of a gang or a small copycat crew or group of young people parroting hand signals on Facebook or popular colors used by established criminal organizations.</p>

<p>The study acknowledges that groups it mentions may not have the "established hierarchy" or connections to larger organized criminal gangs that state law currently requires for categorizing gang members. "Emerging trends within Mississippi include hybrid gangs, neighborhood cliques, changes in established groups, and an increase in the presence of national gangs," the report states.</p>

<p>A "neighborhood clique" often consists of young people of various races parroting gang culture, and studies show that many of those children grow out of the dalliance—a fact that is not acknowledged in the report, which is focused on apprehension and prosecution.</p>

<p>Leaving Prison a Worse Gangster</p>

<p>The Mississippi Department of Corrections also participated in the study, providing a clue that many gang experts warn about—many leave prison a more hardened gang member than when they went in, and return to communities and commit worse crime. And much gang activity is run from within state and federal prisons, where cell phones tend to be readily available, even as drug and other rehabilitation are scarce.</p>

<p>"The Mississippi Department of Corrections determined that 62 percent of 19,150 inmates incarcerated as of December 14, 2017, have been identified as an active gang member in their facility," Hunter told lawmakers.</p>

<p>How Police Can (and Cannot) Deter Gunfire</p>

<p>A graphic near the end of the report shows the breakdown of "offenses committed by validated gang members released from MDOC in 2017: 816 percent committed crimes against property; 814 percent drug offenses; 488 percent crimes against persons; and 217 percent other offenses.</p>

<p>The study did not hide its apparent intended usage as a support document for the new expanded gang law that would make it easier to send alleged "gang" members of various kinds to prison and for longer periods of time: "The draft bill creates the crime of criminal gang activity and addresses the problems associated with juvenile recruitment, youth gang members, the organized 'money men,' gang tactics, and allows the use of a statewide Grand Jury. It would further mandate statutory minimums for criminal gang activity and require the penalty for the crime to run consecutive to the underlying felony."</p>

<p>Multiple studies, however, find that gang members who go to prison re-commit crimes at a higher rate when they leave than do other inmates. In Illinois, the state where several large gangs represented in Mississippi (whether connected or through copycat groups) originate, researchers found that later gang activity grew more likely when the suspects were behind bars. "By the end of this period, 75 percent of the gang members had been rearrested for a new offense, compared with 63 percent of the nongang members. Gang members tended to be rearrested sooner after release than the nongang members," the report found.</p>

<p>The BOTEC report warned about the lack of re-entry strategies for former gang members and other criminals—which the Legislature seems to be dragging its feet on even as it tries to expand gang enforcement. BOTEC also warned in its "Gang Violence Assessment" report on Hinds County that keeping suspects in pre-trial detention in local jails is exposing them to gang activity, while warning about perceived corruption within the system, including prosecutors' offices and halfway houses.</p>

<p>"Correctional facilities are roundly criticized. Participants told us that those released or paroled from prison are bused directly to downtown Jackson without a reintegration strategy, which strains resources and increases the incidence of violent crime. Assessment participants described 'convict leasing scams' in which parolees are placed in halfway houses and required to work in state-supported programs, with wages being paid directly to the halfway house."</p>

<p>Where are the Hate Crimes?</p>

<p>In a state with strong Aryan Brotherhood and other white-supremacist gang activity as close by as Rankin County, Rep. Adrienne Wooten, D-Jackson, asked why hate groups are not specifically listed in the legislation. Hunter noted that the definition of criminal gang activity would encompass hate crimes, and later the committee adopted an amendment from DPS to include groups with "shared beliefs" to the definition of gang.</p>

<p>"While I understand that you feel that the language does include hate groups, you know for yourself that when you're sitting or standing before a judge, a judge interprets things, and generally they interpret it literally, in other words if the wording is not in the bill, then many of them will say well, they didn't include it," Wooten said, as she considered offering an amendment to add the language.</p>

<p>Gipson opposed Wooten's amendment argued that the only way to add hate crimes to the bill would be to add an entire list of every crime statewide.</p>

<p>"The only way we could deal with that is to include every code section in that set of books over there of every crime in the state of Mississippi," Gipson said, motioning to a shelf full of law codes.</p>

<p>The "Anti-Gang" legislation actually goes further than state crimes, however. Gipson later noted that the bill covers all crimes, both state and federal.</p>

<p>"Everything is covered, if it's a crime in a state of Mississippi, if it's a federal crime or a crime in any other state, because you have these gangs working across state borders," Gipson said. "So this is already covering every crime, and I think it's satisfactory."</p>

<p>Evidence-based programs that can help prevent and reduce community gun violence</p>

<p>BOTEC's Caution on 'Suppression-only Strategies'</p>

<p>The bill, however, is not designed to prevent gang activity, only to make it easier to send away anyone associated with a vast array of large or small gangs and groups. It shows no consideration of a recent BOTEC Analysis study of Jackson crime—one of the primary areas the fusion report identifies as a hotbed of gang activity—that warns that one of the top two precursors of whether a young person will later commit more violent crime is putting him or her into a police car or jail.</p>

<p>The Legislature paid $500,000 for the analysis, which did not sugarcoat the realities of crime and gangs, while probing for causes and solutions. BOTEC recommended a variety of solutions that do not necessarily involve sending gang members to gang-packed prisons that can, in turn, send more danger back into communities when they're released.</p>

<p>Instead of massive policing sweeps that cast a wide net, BOTEC recommended targeted actions such as the Operation Ceasefire model, which seeks to help gang members as well as threaten tough criminal sentences. In addition, BOTEC called for "holistic" community responses to gang violence and a rejection of "suppression-only strategies" that the new gang bill would make easier to employ.</p>

<p>"There are groups like the Urban Peace Institute that work with criminalized or gang involved youth to help turn them away from destructive behavior and engage in productive and socially appropriate behavior," BOTEC researchers wrote.</p>

<p>A full archive of the JFP's "Preventing Violence" series, supported by grants from the Solutions Journalism Network. Photo of Zeakyy Harrington by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>"They have had success nationwide in designing programs that acknowledge that there are certain children that are unwanted by much of society and deal with the issue directly and professionally. They create Comprehensive Violence Reduction Strategies to humanize at-risk youth and tackle the origins of and problems their behavior is causing. They also take a 'public health approach (that) rejects suppression-only strategies that fail to address the underlying community conditions spawning gangs and violence.' This model advocates for a wrap-around solution for each affected community."</p>

<p>The Homeland Security gang-assessment report gives lip service to prevention in its last two sentences, asking "What prevention programs are in elementary and/or middle schools to offset the recruitment of youths into gangs?" and "What methods do mental health facilities have in place for monitoring the gang presence in their facilities?"</p>

<p>The Mississippi District Attorneys Association and Police Chiefs Association support the new gang legislation, Gipson said, and he noted that DPS and Homeland Security have both reviewed it. He also said the governor supports the bill.</p>

<p>After 20 minutes of discussion, the bill passed with the majority of the committee voting "yay" and Wooten voting "no, no, no." The bill now goes to the full House for a vote.</p>

<h2 id="reentryreformhitswallbutkidsnolongerfacedeathpenalty">Re-entry Reform Hits Wall, But Kids No Longer Face Death Penalty</h2>

<p>Rep. Joel Bomgar, R-Madison, introduced legislation to implement more re-entry reforms for men and women coming out of prison. The House Corrections Committee, led by Chairman Bill Kinkade, R-Byhalia, all but killed the measure on Wednesday, Jan. 24. Photo by Arielle Dreher.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Rep. Joel Bomgar, R-Madison, had a tough time convincing the House Corrections Committee to pass additional re-entry criminal-justice reforms on Wednesday, Jan. 24. Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, passed last year's Re-entry Council legislation easily through the Judiciary B Committee earlier this year; however, Bomgar's bill includes reforms that are not on Gipson's bill.</p>

<p>Bomgar introduced House Bill 942, which picks up several pieces of the state Re-entry Council's suggested reforms that were left on the cutting-room floor last year. Among other things, the bill would make it easier for men and women coming out of custody to get a driver's license after their first interactions with the criminal-justice system, establish parental accountability courts to keep families together and keep parents from going to jail for being unable to pay child support, and allow judges to modify sentences.</p>

<p>"This bill focuses on employability and re-entry," Bomgar told the House Corrections Committee on Wednesday. "(From) getting people back on their feet to getting them jobs so they won't re-offend."</p>

<p>The bill proposes adding these reforms to state law, and Chairman Bill Kinkade, R-Byhalia, said he had several problems with it. Rep. Mark Tullos, R-Raleigh, asked about a part of the legislation that would give employers who hire a person with criminal history limited liability.</p>

<p>"My concern is we're creating a protection or an exemption for the employer," Tullos said. "... But just because the employer hires them, we shouldn't give them some type of exemption from liability."</p>

<p>The chairman reiterated his concerns.</p>

<p>"I see several problems with this," Kinkade said. "... So I think we're still not ready."</p>

<p>Bomgar said he was open to editing out problematic sections, and when it became evident that the legislation's fate was questionable, he asked the chairman to at least keep the part of the bill that dealt with driver's licenses.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman, would you be open to deleting the problematic sections, especially the driver's license section?" Bomgar asked. "Just in talking to several people, that continually comes up as a significant barrier to people getting back on their feet."</p>

<p>Kinkade recognized Rep. Charles Young, D-Meridian, to enter a "motion to table," subject to call, instead, essentially killing the bill.</p>

<p>The committee passed several other housekeeping bills that extended the life of the parole board and other programs. The committee also passed a measure that would allow men and women convicted of a crime of violence to be eligible for parole after serving 50 percent of their sentence.</p>

<p>The House Corrections Committee passed House Bill 950 on to the Judiciary B Committee on Wednesday, which changes state law to conform to the Supreme Court's ruling on juvenile offenders.</p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the Alabama v. Miller 5-4 decision in 2012 that minors cannot be sentenced to mandatory life in prison without parole if convicted of capital murder, as the court said such a sentence violated a minor's Eighth Amendment rights.</p>

<p>Juvenile offenders, who are 18 years old or younger, convicted of capital murder must serve a minimum of 25 years in the state's custody but not more than 50 years. The legislation says juvenile offenders convicted of capital murder "may be sentenced to life imprisonment," but then goes on to set sentencing limits if they are not sentenced for life in prison.</p>

<p>The bill also clarifies that juvenile offenders cannot receive death sentences. The legislation would be retroactive, applying to all arrests and convictions regardless of the date they occurred.</p>

<p>Clarification: This story has been updated to reflect that the Alabama v. Miller decision prohibited minors from being mandatorily sentenced to life in prison without parole. </p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Reporters will be welcome from now on at meetings of a task force convened by Attorney General Jim Hood to examine Mississippi's mental health system.</p>

<p>Margaret Ann Morgan, Hood's spokeswoman, said Tuesday that a majority of 30-plus members had voted to open their meetings.</p>

<p>Several news organizations had contested the decision to close the meetings. Hood's office had said it was necessary because some participating organizations won't let their employees talk to reporters. The Clarion-Ledger filed a complaint with the Mississippi Ethics Commission after its reporter was barred from a December meeting.</p>

<p>Hood has said the group isn't subject to Mississippi's open meetings law.</p>

<p>The task force's next meeting is Thursday.</p>

<p>The U.S. Justice Department is suing the state, claiming its mental health system relies too much on institutions.</p>

<p>The Jackson Zoological Society Board and Jackson Zoo staff wishes to express their deepest condolences to the family and friends of Mr. Percy King.</p>

<p>He dedicated his life to being a liaison between humans and wildlife in the Jackson Community, encouraging all ages to face and even overcome fears and prejudices regarding animals with an educational focus.</p>

<p>He served as both a Jackson zookeeper from 1997 to 2011, and as a member of the Jackson Zoo Board starting in 2017, willingly sharing his knowledge and experience with his peers and officials for the benefit of his neighborhood, community, and state. Many will remember him as “The Snake Man,” as well as his love for all creatures, but especially elephants.</p>

<p>The remaining board, staff, and families are shocked and saddened by his untimely passing. We endeavor to keep his legacy intact, and our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones as they search for solace, and hopefully eventual peace.</p>

<p>Andrew J. Williams Esq.</p>

<p>Flanked by police and civil leaders of Jackson, Miss., U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst spent a press conference arguing for draconian acts of "justice" to be inflicted on Jackson's people—primarily her poor, disenfranchised and minority residents. He outlined a "crime-fighting" plan for federal, state, and local officials to team up against those accused of crime, locking them up without bail, refusing to negotiate any plea bargains and sending them to federal prisons in other states. Of course, the plan was not so explicitly stated. Instead, it was couched in terms of "protecting the community," and "helping the people."</p>

<p>Project EJECT is apparently simple: "If you violate our laws, you will be ejected from our community." While the initiative is purportedly supposed to only combat violence, Hurst's choice of words are telling: Anyone accused of violating "laws" will result in ejection, not only those accused of "commit[ing] violence." How long before any and every accusation is worthy of the Project EJECT strategy?</p>

<p>The initiative is not original, and it is not a novel way to combat violence. It is the failed "war on drugs"; it is New York's unconstitutional "Stop and Frisk" program and all other "tough on crime" crusades. Like all of them, it will result in collateral damage to society's most vulnerable.</p>

<p>In response to crime rates (which according to Pew Research are at all-time average lows), law enforcement and the State demand more power. The terrified people hand over power that should be theirs. The courts yield civil rights and protections to law enforcement. Time passes, but crime never ends despite overflowing court dockets. The people see no true change, but law enforcement showboats about arrest rates. The accused waste away in overcrowded jails, but the private-prison industry continues to profit. The convicted are forever separated from their families, who ultimately are their best hope for rehabilitation.</p>

<p>Project EJECT is an attack on the people under the guise of protecting them. Hurst scornfully attacks the idea of bail for the accused, ignoring that it is a constitutionally guaranteed right. He threatens future defendants in his courtroom with a refusal to work out plea deals, disregarding that the entire purpose of the plea deal is a fair result for each individual defendant. The threat of sending those convicted of a crime to prisons outside of Mississippi is an insult to the families of the accused.</p>

<p>In a separate op-ed, Hurst paid lip service to the reality that "we can't arrest our way out of crime" and suggests possible alternatives to incarceration. This is not the first time we've heard this. Every time the government launches a new anti-crime initiative, it's sold to the public as an alternative to the "old way." Yet every time said initiative is enacted and time moves on, the reality comes to light: This is no alternative. The jails are still full. The U.S. still has the world's largest prison population, with Mississippi having one of the highest incarceration rates. The new Jim Crow continues its bloody work.</p>

<p>Jackson, do not fall for this. Yes, crime is awful. People are grieving for those whom violence has taken from them. No one disputes that there is work to be done, but fighting violence with violence, eviscerating the rights of the people, taking power from the people and filling the prisons to the profit of capitalists will never work. Demand real solutions. Attack the root causes of crime: extreme poverty; drug addiction; poor mental health; a lack of resources for quality education; the lack of jobs and affordable housing; a corrupt criminal "justice" system; and an economic system that benefits only the owners of capital, those with financial power and those who carry the banner of white supremacy.</p>

<p>Crime in Jackson is not unassailable, but we do not stop it with draconian initiatives; we stop it by building a better city. We beat it with quality health care for the addict, the uninsured, the poor, for everyone to ensure society cares for the needy rather than cast them out. We prevent crime by investing in education. We reduce crime by overturning and rebuilding the system, which entraps young people of Jackson into cyclical poverty and want. Project EJECT wants to fight fire with fire. The people of Jackson must reject this useless plan, and work together to enact real and lasting solutions to help their city.</p>

<p>Better Than Ezra fans will hear plenty of hit songs when the band's frontman, Kevin Griffin, performs solo on Jan. 19 in Jackson. However, not all of those familiar tunes come courtesy of the New Orleans, La., alternative-rock act.</p>

<p>Griffin has had a string of successful songs through Better Than Ezra since forming the group in Baton Rouge, La., in 1988, including "Good," "King of New Orleans," "In the Blood" and "Desperately Wanting." What some listeners may not know is that he has also co-written hits for well-known artists such as Sugarland, James Blunt, Howie Day and Daniel Powter.</p>

<p>The Jackson Free Press recently spoke with Griffin over the phone about his latest tour and what goes on behind the scenes in songwriting.</p>

<p>With Better Than Ezra still touring, what inspired you to also get on the road doing solo shows?</p>

<p>I guess maybe two years (ago)—Ezra's still touring a lot, and we do our summer tours—I wanted a forum where I could not only do Ezra songs, but I could also play the songs I get to write with other artists in just a less formal setting. There were suddenly a lot of rooms around the country, like City Winery in Chicago, ... that were embracing that kind of (show). You know, they're about 350- to 500-seat rooms, and I thought, "Wow, that sounds really cool."</p>

<p>I started off just playing acoustic, and I kind of wanted to challenge myself to get back to doing that, maybe the purity of that. I like talking (to audiences) a lot and maybe taking left turns, so that's really just a creative outlet.</p>

<p>What can people expect to hear that they wouldn't hear at a BTE show?</p>

<p>Well, they hear songs that (are) hits I've had with other artists, from Howie Day songs or Taylor Swift or James Blunt, and just different artists like that—my versions of these songs. Usually, if it's a female artist, it's an octave lower. [Laughs] And (there are) just covers. I like doing things that wouldn't be expected.</p>

<p>When I do these shows, they're still very, I guess, up-tempo. I love artists like Ray LaMontagne and Damien Rice, but I'm not that guy. When I do these shows, I have an amazing percussionist with me, so it's a very upbeat, fun show. I may do a left turn into a Justin Timberlake song out of a Better Than Ezra song or a solo song I'm working on. So there are lot of stories, anecdotes, covers, songs I've written for other people, and you know, hopefully the songs we know and love by Better Than Ezra.</p>

<p>An error occurred.</p>

<p>Try watching this video on www.youtube.com, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.</p>

<p>What kind of response do you usually get when playing a song that some fans don't know you wrote or co-wrote?</p>

<p>I love that because, let's say a song like "Collide," which is still getting tons of radio play, I'll tell the story about writing it, I'll play it, and then after the show, invariably, someone will come up to me and go, "Man, I love that cover you did of Howie Day." They still won't realize I wrote it, and that's really funny.</p>

<p>But it's cool to see, for the most part, the awareness or realization that, "Oh wow, you wrote this? Let me hear how you interpret it." I love seeing that look on people's faces. Then, you know, there are always songs that maybe I—"give" is a strong word—but have another artist do, and they're mostly co-writes, rather than myself or Better Than Ezra. So you always have (the question), "If 'Collide' had been a Better Than Ezra song, would it have taken Better Than Ezra's career to a whole other level?"</p>

<p>So when I get to do these songs solo, I get to have that satisfaction of playing it live and hearing people sing along. ... So it's a two-way street: People enjoy hearing the hits that they didn't know I'm a part of, and I get to kind of have that vicarious thrill you get when you play a song people know.</p>

<p>The thrill never goes away. From the first time I heard my song on the radio and the first time I heard people singing it live, I still have that today.</p>

<p>How do you approach songwriting differently working with another artist compared to writing for Better Than Ezra or yourself?</p>

<p>What I'll do is I'll have a write with an artist, like I have some songs on the new Phillip Phillips record, and I won't finish the song. I'll say, "OK, this is a cool chorus idea and sounds like something I can hear Phillip singing," so I'll just get the chorus together. That's usually enough to see if the artist likes it. With Better Than Ezra, I'll have the whole song done, and then the band will arrange it with me. We'll figure out dynamics. With a co-write, there's no point in me finishing the whole song, because if they don't like the chorus, they'll say, "What else do you have?"</p>

<p>And also, you want to give the artist something to work on and (work) off of. That's when the song really becomes great. When it's good, the artist is a good writer, and they're engaged and come up with some great verse, or they make the chorus even better. You just come up with what you think is the hook, play it for them, and they go, "Oh, I dig that, but let's change this chord here." So it's kind of more a piecemeal thing when you're working with other artists.</p>

<p>When you do have an idea that you think is perfect for an artist, what do you do when they don't respond well to it?</p>

<p>You know what? You just move on. It's so often, and that's just kind of the thing with songwriting. I never get bummed out about it anymore because, as a writer, you tend to think everything you do is great. "Oh, this is a great chorus." Then, you realize, "Well, sometimes, that's not the case." Some songs you write, people dig, and other songs, for whatever reason, people aren't feeling.</p>

<p>Then, there are those writers who everything they write (is a hit), whether it's Paul McCartney or f*cking Pharrell (Williams) or whoever is great. But most of us, we hit some out of the park, and others are just foul balls.</p>

<p>So when I sing a song idea, you quickly move on because the worst thing you can do is keep trying to make them feel it. Either they feel it, or they don't. ... Part of the craft of songwriting is remembering your ideas. So then, I'll work with another artist, and I've had songs that have been turned down that I've then played for other artists, and they love (the ideas). They ended up recording them. You keep the songs that you say, "I know this is f*cking good." You know those songs, and it's with a heavy heart that you finally will let one go when you're like, "Man, I've played this for three people. I'm on a train built for one."</p>

<p>What can fans be looking forward to from you after this tour?</p>

<p>Better Than Ezra is doing a nationwide summer tour. Us and Barenaked Ladies will be playing. We're not playing Jackson, but we'll be playing Greek Theatre, Red Rocks and all these great amphitheaters, so check that out. That would be a fun trip this summer to take. I'll have a solo record coming out in the fall, and I'll be playing a few new solo songs at the show at Hal &amp; Mal's.</p>

<p>Then, I've also started (Pilgrimage Music Festival), and we'll have our fourth year this September 22 and 23, a Saturday and Sunday. Last year, our headliners were Justin Timberlake, Eddie Vedder, Ryan Adams, The Avett Brothers and many others. ... It's become one of the hottest festivals in the country in four short years. I'll be playing it solo—Ezra usually does it—but it's the third week of September in Franklin, Tennessee, and it's brilliant.</p>

<p>Kevin Griffin performs at 7:30 p.m., Friday, Jan. 19, at Hal &amp; Mal's (200 Commerce St.). J.R. Moore of Ingram Hill also performs. Tickets are $25 each at ticketmaster.com. For more information, visit kevingriffinmusic.com.</p>

<h2 id="mississippiburningkkkleaderkillendiesinprisonat92">'Mississippi Burning' KKK Leader Killen Dies in Prison at 92</h2>

<p>by: The Associated Press</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-12</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Edgar Ray Killen, a 1960s Ku Klux Klan leader who was convicted decades later in the "Mississippi Burning" slayings of three civil rights workers, has died in prison at the age of 92, the state's corrections department announced Friday.</p>

<p>The one-time Klan leader was serving three consecutive 20-year terms for manslaughter when he died at 9 p.m. Thursday night inside the Mississippi State Penitentiary. An autopsy was pending, but no foul play was suspected, the corrections' statement said.</p>

<p>His conviction came 41 years to the day after James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman, all in their 20s, were ambushed and killed by Klansmen.</p>

<p>The three Freedom Summer workers had been investigating the burning of a black church near Philadelphia, Mississippi. A deputy sheriff in Philadelphia had arrested them on a traffic charge, then released them after alerting a mob. Mississippi's then-governor claimed their disappearance was a hoax before their bodies were dug up.</p>

<p>The slayings shocked the nation, helped spur passage of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 and were dramatized in the 1988 movie "Mississippi Burning."</p>

<p>The part-time preacher and lumber mill operator was 80 when a Neshoba County jury convicted him of three counts of manslaughter on June 21, 2005, despite his assertions that he was innocent. Killen was the only person ever to face state murder charges, and the only one to end up in state prison. "It wasn't even murder it was manslaughter," David Goodman, Andrew's younger brother, observed on Friday.</p>

<p>"His life spanned a period in this country where members of the Ku Klux Klan like him were able to believe they had a right to take other people's lives, and that's a form of terrorism," Goodman said. "Many took black lives without impunity."</p>

<p>Goodman said Killen's passing is a reminder that issues of racism and white nationalism remain today. He pointed to the violent rally of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia as an example.</p>

<p>Killen wouldn't say much about the killings during a 2014 interview with The Associated Press inside the penitentiary. He said he remained a segregationist who did not believe in racial equality, but contended he harbored no ill will toward blacks. Killen said he never had talked about the events that landed him behind bars, and never would.</p>

<p>Long a suspect in the 1964 slayings, Killen had made a livelihood from farming, operating his sawmill and preaching to a small congregation at Smyrna Baptist Church in Union, south of Philadelphia, Mississippi.</p>

<p>According to FBI files and court transcripts from a 1967 federal conspiracy trial, Killen did most of the planning in the ambush killings of the civil rights workers. According to testimony in the 2005 murder trial, Killen served as a kleagle, or organizer, of the Klan in Neshoba County and helped set up a klavern, or local Klan group, in a nearby county.</p>

<p>Nineteen men, including Killen, were indicted on federal charges in the 1967 case. Seven were convicted of violating the victims' civil rights. None served more than six years.</p>

<p>Killen's federal case ended with a hung jury after one juror said she couldn't convict a preacher. During his state trial in 2005, witnesses testified that on June 21, 1964, Killen went to Meridian to round up carloads of Klansmen to ambush Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman, telling some of the Klan members to bring plastic or rubber gloves. Witnesses said Killen then went to a Philadelphia funeral home as an alibi while the fatal attack occurred.</p>

<p>The three bodies were found 44 days later, buried in a red-clay dam in rural Neshoba County.</p>

<p>In February 2010, Killen sued the FBI, claiming the government used a mafia hit man to pistol-whip and intimidate witnesses for information in the case. The federal lawsuit sought millions of dollars in damages and a declaration that his rights were violated when the FBI allegedly used a gangster known as "The Grim Reaper" during the investigation. The lawsuit was later dismissed.</p>

<p>In the AP interview, Killen repeated his contention that he was not a criminal, but a political prisoner. Of one thing he was certain: "I could have beat that thing if I'd had the mental ability."</p>

<p>When she learned of Killen's death, Chaney's sister, the Rev. Julia Chaney Moss, said her first thought was that "God has been kind to him. And for that I am grateful."</p>

<p>"My last thought on this is just that I only wish peace and blessings for all the families as well as the families of the perpetrators," she added.</p>

<h2 id="crisesinthecapitolinfrastructurecrimelabnotenoughmoneytocoverneeds">Crises in the Capitol: Infrastructure, Crime Lab, Not Enough Money to Cover Needs</h2>

<p>by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-10</p>

<p>It's hard to prosecute someone for a violent crime if you do not know how the victim died. The Mississippi Legislature is grappling over that question in the new session; the Mississippi crime lab is in crisis.</p>

<p>Crime Lab Director Sam Howell told senators last week that he will be down to just one medical examiner in a few months. The state would need seven to meet national standards. In the most recent fiscal year, the medical examiner's office performed just over 1,400 autopsies with just three doctors. In 2018, the lead medical examiner might face that caseload alone.</p>

<p>Sen. Hob Bryan, D-Amory, invited Howell to speak with senators about the lab at a Judiciary B Committee meeting last week. Medical examiners are leaving the crime lab, Howell said, because of the workload.</p>

<p>"They all could make more money and do less work somewhere else," Howell told senators.</p>

<p>The result is delayed trials, prosecutions and closure in cases across the state. Sen. Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, reminded the committee that lawmakers voted to build a crime-lab facility on the Gulf Coast that is sitting empty.</p>

<p>For now, every autopsy needed in the state, for car accidents, homicides or suicides, is done at the Pearl facility.</p>

<p>"Instead, the bodies are shipped up here—I can only imagine how that is—instead of going to this state-of-the-art facility that the State has already paid money for," Wiggins said.</p>

<p>Howell said three of the four candidates who interviewed for a Gulf Coast coroner job decided to look for jobs elsewhere with lighter caseloads. The majority of backlogged autopsies run between six months to a year old, Howell told senators, although coroners can finish limited autopsies—and get the bodies back out—within 24 hours. Medical examiners conduct autopsies all day, so they often do not have enough time to finish reports, Howell said. On more complicated cases, they are forced to send material out-of-state to Texas for additional study and opinion. The delay on autopsy reports can mean a delay in issuing a death certificate—and a delay in paid life insurance as a consequence. It can also mean delayed prosecutions and trials.</p>

<p>"They (prosecutors) usually can't get an indictment, much less prosecution, until they get that final autopsy report," Howell said. Wiggins pointed out that this also means victim's families are waiting months or years to know the cause of death of their loved one.</p>

<p>Howell requested about $11 million for the crime lab this year, but the Joint Legislative Budget Committee has recommended a cut to the agency in the upcoming fiscal year instead, proposing an $8.6 million budget instead of the little over $9 million budget the lab received this year.</p>

<p>Supporting Tax Cuts?</p>

<p>On Thursday, Jan. 4, the Mississippi Economic Council held its annual "Capital Day" event to outline priorities. The state chamber of commerce's top two legislative priorities are infrastructure and workforce development.</p>

<p>"If we can't get the right workforce, our businesses will die, so it's a survival sort of position," William Yates, CEO of Yates Construction and the chairman of MEC, said. "We have to figure out how to be innovative."</p>

<p>Top Republican lawmakers asked MEC to support them in the upcoming session on not only their infrastructure funding initiatives but also on an education formula funding re-write.</p>

<p>House Speaker Pro Tempore Greg Snowden, R-Meridian, also asked MEC to drum up support for the tax cuts lawmakers have taken since 2012.</p>

<p>"(I want to talk about this) accusation, if you will, that Republicans are bankrupting this state because of the corporate tax cuts, corporate giveaways to cronies and fat cats, and that sort of thing," Snowden told Mississippi business leaders at the Capitol last week. "And I want to remind you that MEC was very much engaged on these issues and properly so. We didn't do this because MEC asked us to; we did it because we're convinced that it's good policy."</p>

<p>MEC supported the Legislature's biggest efforts to re-write state tax policy to benefit businesses, including the Taxpayer Pay Raise Act, passed in 2016 only after Republicans had a supermajority in the statehouse.</p>

<p>"We want you to remember that; we want you to preach that," Snowden said.</p>

<p>The State's projected budget outlook is slim, and the majority of agencies are looking at budget cuts again in the coming fiscal year, as Republicans designed. The Taxpayer Pay Raise Act will divert more than $33 million from the general fund in fiscal-year 2019. That number will nearly triple in 2020 and grow to $416 million annually in a decade. Lawmakers will have to make difficult budget choices with less revenue this session as a result, and even the governor acknowledged that last week.</p>

<p>"The challenges that the Mississippi Legislature has now are large," Gov. Phil Bryant told business leaders after discussing the Division of Medicaid's budget deficit and public education funding.</p>

<p>Infrastructure Crisis</p>

<p>Despite questions of the legislation's actual impact, the House passed three of five transportation-funding bills in the first week of the session. The legislation included one bill to set aside 50 percent of general-fund revenue that exceeds 2 percent growth for the state's roads and bridges.</p>

<p>Another bill would enable the state and localities to issue bonds to help fund infrastructure in cities, counties and statewide. The third of the three bills that survived its first vote on the House floor, House Bill 359, was heavily debated in the House Transportation Committee.</p>

<p>The legislation would create a moratorium on any new construction projects, essentially stopping the Mississippi Department of Transportation from starting construction on any projects for which it has not purchased the right-of-way.</p>

<p>The group had to wait 20 minutes for the 100-page bill to be printed, and then Transportation Chairman Rep. Charles Busby, R-Pascagoula, and Vice Chairman Rep. Steve Massengill, R-Hickory Flat, asked the committee to support the measure. Busby said he was not expecting the meeting and was also not wearing a tie. He let Massengill take the lead in the meeting.</p>

<p>Members of the committee were concerned about the bill, and they made several amendments.</p>

<p>"If there was a desire to build new roads, they (MDOT) don't have the money to do it," Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, said. "So what we're doing here sounds good and looks good, and puts lipstick on a pig, so to speak, and we're the pigs. So it makes us look good, but as a matter of fact, we don't have any money to build roads—it's a red herring."</p>

<p>Even Chairman Busby agreed, saying that all five of the measures the committees passed on Wednesday do not fix Mississippi's infrastructure problem.</p>

<p>"Is it going to fix our roads and bridges? Is it going to provide additional funding for our roads and bridges that is desperately needed? It's not," Busby told reporters after the meeting. "But does that mean that this is the only swing at the ball that we're going to get? Absolutely not. The session is brand new; we've got lots of things in the hopper."</p>

<p>By press time, two of the five transportation bills had passed to the Senate.</p>

<h2 id="dismantlingthelastdebtorsprisons">Dismantling the Last Debtors’ Prisons</h2>

<p>by: Arielle Dreher</p>

<p>The Corinth Municipal Court and attorneys with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the MacArthur Justice Center came to an agreement right before Christmas to release men and women from jail who were serving time because they cannot afford their fines or fees. Zeakky/File Illustration</p>

<p>JACKSON — Corinth police officers arrested Sammy Brown on Dec. 1, 2017, and charged him with public drunkenness. Brown sat in jail for several days because he could not afford the $600 bond the Corinth Municipal Court required. Brown does not have a job; in fact, his only source of income is his disability checks he has received since he was a kid.</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center and the MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit to get Brown and fellow inmate Brian Keith Howell out from behind bars. They sued the Corinth Municipal Court and Municipal Court Judge John Ross for operating a "debtors' prison" that violates the state's new rules of criminal procedure, the complaint says.</p>

<p>Jail officials and Judge Ross told both men that they had to pay the court fees or else sit in jail until they could, even as the fee would build each day they were there, the complaint says.</p>

<p>The Corinth Municipal Court forces those charged with crimes (even before they receive a hearing) to pay their bond fees or else sit in jail at a rate of $25 per day until they pay the fine in full, the complaint filed in federal court on Dec. 5 says.</p>

<p>Other Corinth residents with fines have also received notices that say, "100 Today or Jail," the complaint shows.</p>

<p>Home for Christmas</p>

<p>The City of Corinth and attorneys representing the plaintiffs came to a joint interim agreement three days before Christmas Eve. The agreement says that the Alcorn County Correctional Facility, where Corinth Municipal Court sends men and women to be incarcerated, would release all people who are jailed for the failure to pay fines and fees before Christmas. Brown and Howell were released on Dec. 6, the day after SPLC and MacArthur attorneys filed the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The municipal court cannot incarcerate any more individuals who are not able to pay their fees, and under the agreement, it must offer a payment program to those with outstanding fines and fees or allow them to perform community service instead of sitting in jail.</p>

<p>The agreement also says the Corinth Municipal Court will not arrest any person who has an outstanding warrant. The joint interim agreement lasts for two months.</p>

<p>The court has stayed proceedings in the case, and the parties are discussing the possibility of a settlement agreement instead of further litigation. The interim agreement does not mean that the Corinth Municipal Court or Judge Ross have admitted liability in the case, however.</p>

<p>Howell, one of the lead plaintiffs in the case, sat in jail for about a month, and without the lawsuit would have missed Christmas, New Year's Day and several of his kids' birthdays. Corinth police officers pulled Howell over for not having a taillight, then arrested him for having no driver's license or insurance. Howell was at Walmart buying bread and peanut butter for his family, the lawsuit says.</p>

<p>A week later, Howell pleaded guilty to the three traffic tickets, and Judge Ross assessed his fees at more than $1,000. Howell, who does not have steady employment, was in a terrible motorcycle accident two years ago. His leg had to be amputated, and he was in the process of applying for disability insurance when he was arrested.</p>

<p>Howell could not afford his tickets, so he had to sit in jail and would still be there without the joint agreement.</p>

<p>Changing Licensing Rules</p>

<p>The State of Mississippi will stop suspending Mississippians' driver licenses due to the nonpayment of fines and fees this year. Sam Brooke, the deputy legal director of SPLC, said when a person fails to pay court fines or fees in Mississippi the court sends a note to the Department of Public Safety and then DPS suspends a person's license. There is no process in place for asking why a person did not pay the fees or fines.</p>

<p>"(We had) decided to file a lawsuit about it, but we sat down and talked to the Department of Public Safety and the attorney general's office, and that led to a very positive conversation that resulted in them making changes in policy," Brooke told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>All other reasons that DPS can suspend licenses, from non-compliance with a child-support order to multiple DUIs or reckless-driving charges will remain in place. DPS hired staff to restore the licenses affected by the new rule change, however, and letters will go out early this year. There are approximately 100,000 drivers whose licenses are suspended in part or in whole because they could not afford their fees, Brooke said. The reinstatement does not relieve Mississippians of their obligation to pay back the fees, however.</p>

<p>Mississippians with suspended licenses due to unpaid court fines or fees can expect one of three letters. Some will have their licenses reinstated outright. Others will be reinstated, but if their license is expired, they will have to go in to get a new one. DPS will waive the $100 reinstatement fee for those drivers whose licenses are expired under the new rule. Others, whose licenses are suspended for multiple reasons, will still have to clear the other charges before their licenses are reinstated.</p>

<p>"The process of discontinuing suspension of licenses due solely to the nonpayment of fines, fees or assessments will remain in place until future significant developments occur," DPS Commissioner Marshall Fisher said in a press release announcing the rule change.</p>

<p>Reform This Session?</p>

<p>Both Brown and Howell might have avoided jail if Gov. Phil Bryant had not vetoed bipartisan criminal-justice reform legislation in 2017. House Bill 1033 would have made incarceration not automatic following the nonpayment of a fine, restitution or court costs.</p>

<p>House Judiciary B Committee Chairman Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, has already revived the bill, which Bryant vetoed due to the measure that would have allowed certain habitual offenders early release. Gipson changed that part of the bill and brought it to his committee early on Friday, Jan. 5. The committee passed House Bill 387, which will become effective on passage, if it makes it out of the Legislature and clears the governor's scrutiny.</p>

<p>"The bottom line is these individuals are coming back into society, and we want them to become productive members of society, get a job, become taxpayers, and it's important for them to be able to take care of their families," Gipson said.</p>

<p>The bill will force courts to consider a person's financial ability to pay fines or court costs before throwing them in jail as well as allow parole earlier for certain non-violent offenders.</p>

<p>House Bill 387 also creates the Sentencing Disparity Taskforce.</p>

<p>JACKSON — Opponents of LGBT rights in Mississippi enjoyed a legal victory this morning when the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would not review a challenge to the controversial House Bill 1523, which Gov. Phil Bryant signed into law in April 2016. The high court decided not to review disputes over the constitutionality of the "Protecting Freedom of Conscience from Government Discrimination Act," which predominantly Republicans in the Mississippi Legislature passed in 2016.</p>

<p>HB 1523 defines and protects three religious beliefs and moral convictions: Marriage is a union of one man and one woman; sexual relations are reserved for such a marriage; and "male" and "female" refer to an individual's "immutable biological sex as objectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth."</p>

<p>The law "protects" Mississippians who hold those beliefs from "discriminatory action," allowing circuit clerks to recuse themselves from issuing marriage licenses and and employers to make hiring or leasing decisions based on their sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions.</p>

<p>Several Mississippians challenged the law in federal court. In July 2016, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled that the law would violate the Establishment and Equal Protection Clauses in the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>Bryant appealed, however, and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's ruling. House Bill 1523 became law in summer 2017, when the 5th Circuit denied plaintiffs a rehearing in the case. Attorneys in the Barber v. Bryant case appealed the 5th Circuit's decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, the Court decided to pass on the opportunity to answer a critical question about who has access to justice in this country and how much suffering our most vulnerable have to experience before they can seek recourse in the courts, but we will continue to fight against HB 1523 on behalf of LGBT Mississippians and everyone in our state impacted by this draconian law," Mississippi Center for Justice Advocacy Director Beth Orlansky said in a press release.</p>

<p>Critics have called the measure the most sweeping piece of anti-LGBT legislation in the country, with anti-LGBT advocates nationwide hoping to use it as a model for blocking same-sex marriage and other legal rights.</p>

<p>"The government-approved beliefs outlined by HB 1523 target LGBT Mississippians and leave the state's most vulnerable in harm's way," Beth Littrell, an attorney at Lambda Legal, said in a press release.</p>

<p>In sunny September, leaders of Mississippi agencies went before lawmakers to make their annual requests for funding. Inside the crowded room on the first floor of the Woolfolk Building, the mood was awkward. State economist Darrin Webb reminded lawmakers of the state economy's "lackluster" performance post-recession.</p>

<p>At one point, all of the public university presidents went before the group of senators and representatives tasked with crafting the state budget. A few university presidents sat with Commissioner Glenn Boyce, while the rest lined up along the wall behind them. Mississippi State President Mark Keenum told lawmakers that higher education is crucial for creating an educated work force in the state.</p>

<p>"I love this state, and I know you do, too. I don't want to see Mississippi left behind," Keenum told lawmakers.</p>

<p>A few months later, the Joint Legislative Budget Committee released a stringent budget that expresses the reality in Mississippi—something has got to give. Even a cursory look at Mississippi's finances show that few state agencies can expect the same amount of funding they have now. But this is by design.</p>

<p>The Republican supermajority plans to continue to shrink the size of government in 2018. Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves has made these plans abundantly clear in past years, passing the state's largest tax cut ever in 2016 and killing the transportation bond bill in 2017. He was not available for an interview prior to the legislative session but sent the Jackson Free Press a statement detailing his priorities.</p>

<p>"I will not operate state government like they do in Washington, D.C.; we will only spend the tax dollars that we are taking in," Reeves said in the statement to the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>The Joint Legislative Budget Committee, made up of lawmakers, adopted a budget that cuts the State's general fund by $66.1 million or 1.3 percent. The legislators' plan includes small increases for the Department of Public Safety to fund 60 state troopers who will graduate from in 2018. Beyond that, a handful of agencies and programs, including the Mississippi Adequate Education Program, financial aid and Child Protection Services, will receive the same amount of funding as in 2017, if lawmakers adopt their leaders' budget recommendations.</p>

<p>"I also want to look for more ways to limit spending," Reeves said. "For example last year, the Legislature put a hold on the purchase of new state vehicles. Previous efforts saved us about $20 million total. I would like to implement more efficiency measure likes this to save tax dollars."</p>

<p>The majority of agencies can expect cuts, however.</p>

<p>The governor's budget priorities are a bit outside the lawmakers' suggestions. Gov. Phil Bryant emphasized spending on education, including a potential plan to fund community colleges.</p>

<p>"The Mississippi Works Scholars Program proposes to incentivize high school seniors and adults already in the workplace by offering free community college degrees, certificates and apprenticeships necessary to gain employment in these opportunity occupations," Bryant's budget recommendation says.</p>

<p>Democrats plan to introduce legislation (again) to stop the Taxpayer Pay Raise Act from taking effect. The tax cuts are already eating away at the State's coffers this year. In fiscal-year 2019 (which begins in July 2018), the tax cut will divert more than $33 million away from the general fund.</p>

<p>By 2028, the full cut will cost Mississippi more than $416 million annually.</p>

<p>Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson, said he will introduce a measure again to reduce the cuts. Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, said he plans to introduce similar legislation on the House side.</p>

<p>"We should at least postpone it until we are back on our feet fiscally," Baria told the Jackson Free Press, saying the tax cut could have included triggers to not take effect until the Mississippi economy has grown 3 to 4 percent. It is not projected to grow at all in the near future, Webb told lawmakers this fall.</p>

<p>Rewriting MAEP</p>

<p>Top Republican leaders plan to change, scrap or re-write the Mississippi Adequate Education Program in 2018. Last year, legislative leadership hired EdBuild, a New Jersey school funding nonprofit, to evaluate and suggest revisions to the State's education funding formula, called MAEP for short. The EdBuild proposal suggests additional funding for certain student populations, called weights. Students in poverty, students who need special education and those who are English-language learners would all receive more funding.</p>

<p>At the 2017 annual Hob Nob event, Reeves and Gunn applauded the proposed weights that include extra funding to help students in gifted programs and high schools that have college- and career-prep programs.</p>

<p>Gov. Bryant supports the education-funding formula rewrite that House Speaker Philip Gunn, R-Clinton, and Reeves plan to work on in 2018.</p>

<p>"I am again calling for an updated funding formula that is focused on student needs. In January, a group of experts retained by the Legislature released a lengthy report with a number of worthy recommendations, including needed changes to the weights applied to career and technical education," Bryant wrote in his budget recommendations. "I look forward to an open and robust debate about the funding formula reforms during the 2018 legislative session. While this budget recommends level funding for MAEP for FY2019, adjustments may be needed to accommodate a new formula."</p>

<p>By Imani Khayyam</p>

<p>Rebecca Sibilia, the director of education nonprofit EdBuild, answered questions from lawmakers last year in a tense environment when Republicans attempted to rush a re-write of the funding formula in 2017. The formula re-write is set for 2018, instead.</p>

<p>The EdBuild proposal is not meant to be a list or a "menu" of suggestions, Director Rebecca Sibilia told the Jackson Free Press, but instead meant to be taken and enacted as a whole to be effective.</p>

<p>"The bottom line is our recommendations were written in order to ensure that Mississippi is thinking about a holistic way of not just funding schools but resourcing schools and putting the right kind of accountability and transparency in place to happen at the local level," Sibilia said. She acknowledged that it is up to the Legislature to decide how to use the proposal.</p>

<p>She hopes lawmakers will not try to cherrypick the ideas, though. "In no instance were we considering this to be a menu of options. We put forward a holistic set of recommendations that were intended to work together," Sibilia said.</p>

<p>Last session, few lawmakers saw a draft of the legislation containing funding formula changes, and ultimately, a bill never appeared. So far in the off-season, Republicans have kept their proposals behind closed doors, leaving Democrats in the dark about any proposals, but changes seem eminent.</p>

<p>Nancy Loome, with the Parents' Campaign, believes a shortcoming of EdBuild's proposal is the lack of a formula to calculate the base student cost, which MAEP includes.</p>

<p>"(That) means in the legislation, there will be nothing written in as a formula that will determine what that base cost is. It would leave it up to the Legislature every year," Loome said at an education-funding panel at Millsaps in November.</p>

<p>The EdBuild proposal recommends a higher base student cost than the Legislature currently funds but does not recommend language for legislation. The weights could still apply regardless of how much funding the Legislature chooses to appropriate to the funding formula.</p>

<p>"When there's no base cost written in with no formula, you have no way to hold the Legislature accountable because there is no formula for the Legislature to yield a number that is full-funded, so we don't know what full funding is," Loome said in November.</p>

<p>Currently, MAEP provides a way for school districts and organizations like the Parents' Campaign to see how underfunded each district is year over year, leading to ballot initiatives like Initiative 42 in 2015, which would have forced the Legislature to fully fund the formula. Depending on how lawmakers write the EdBuild proposal into legislation, "full funding" could mean whatever the Legislature decides each year.</p>

<p>Grant Callen, who lobbies for "school choice" for Empower Mississippi, believes the current funding formula is broken and wants the Legislature to replace it. He said the EdBuild proposal is more equitable and transparent than MAEP but was disappointed that the proposal did not make specific-enough recommendations for local control. Callen emphasized the importance of parental involvement in student funding.</p>

<p>"The next step is to make sure parents have control of how education dollars are spent on their students," Callen said at Millsaps in November.</p>

<p>"No one is more invested in the outcome of our educational system than students and parents, and if parents see that their child is not being well-served in the setting they're in, they must have the freedom to move that child to a better public school, a charter school, a private school and let the funds follow the child to make sure those funds are accomplishing what the Legislature intended."</p>

<p>By Imani Khayyam</p>

<p>Both House Minority Whip Baria, and Sen. David Blount, say they had not seen the legislation for a new funding formula as of press time.</p>

<p>"I don't vote on reports; I vote on bills. And the reason there was never a bill introduced and there was never a vote is because every single member of the Legislature, whether they are Republican or Democrat(ic), will have the same basic questions," Blount said at Millsaps in November. "What is this going to cost? How is this going to affect my local school district, the school districts I represent? Are they getting more money or less money? And what is this going to do to local property taxes?"</p>

<p>The EdBuild proposal is more equitable than MAEP, in part, because the nonprofit recommends that the Legislature eliminate a part of the current formula called the "27 percent rule."</p>

<p>The rule held districts responsible for 27 percent of funding, meaning the State had to kick in 73 percent of funding for public schools. This provision redirects $119 million to 53 districts, and in essence, "biases districts that have a high property-tax base, thereby providing more money than required by the formula," the EdBuild proposal says.</p>

<p>The 27-percent rule creates an "environment in which districts who could arguably raise more money for schools because of their wealth are instead receiving more money from the state to offset their costs than their less affluent peers," the report says.</p>

<p>In EdBuild's data, 53 school districts benefit from this rule, receiving thousands or millions more in funding depending on the number of students in the district.</p>

<p>Sanford Johnson, deputy director of Mississippi First, which lobbies for charter schools, said he supports EdBuild's recommendations but warned against its effectiveness if lawmakers tinker with it too much.</p>

<p>"If the Legislature follows those recommendations ... then I think we'll end up with a good funding formula that will be more equitable than what we have right now," he said at Millsaps in November. "If we start making too many changes to it, there's a chance that we're not going to come out better off, so that's something everyone needs to watch very closely."</p>

<p>Reeves and legislative leaders have been vague about what changes they intend to make to the funding formula.</p>

<p>"Through a new funding formula that prioritizes instruction over administration and support for teacher training and programs that work, we can achieve our goal to give every child a chance at success," Reeves said in the statement to the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Medicaid Fight Coming</p>

<p>Legislation authorizing the State's Medicaid program is up for renewal in the 2018 legislative session. This means lawmakers could easily just reauthorize the program by simply expanding the applicable date. More likely, they might amend how the Medicaid program works between the state agency and the managed-care companies that provide health insurance to Mississippians who could not otherwise afford it.</p>

<p>The Division of Medicaid, under the governor's direct purview, is in a state of turnover. Longtime leader David Dzielak resigned earlier this month, and Gov. Bryant replaced him with longtime aide and counsel Drew Snyder. This change-up comes on the heels of heated pre-session Medicaid meetings and rumors of a possible transfer of eligibility verification from Medicaid to the Mississippi Department of Human Services.</p>

<p>During Dzielak's last meeting before he resigned, House Democrats expressed concerns to him about moving eligibility verification—the process of applying and being approved for medical coverage—to MDHS.</p>

<p>In House Medicaid meetings in December, Rep. Jay Hughes, D-Oxford, brought up MDHS' involvement in lawsuits. In 2017, MDHS sent millions of dollars back to the federal government after not using all of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds allotted to the state. The U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating MDHS' food-stamp program.</p>

<p>"Do you think that it helps patient outcomes or improves services to transfer eligibility of Medicaid to DHS?" Hughes asked Dzielak in December.</p>

<p>"What I can say is Medicaid has some of the best enrollment numbers. We get audited all the time, periodically, by CMS (Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services) and federal auditors," Dzielak said. "... Part of that audit is looking at individuals who are on the program who shouldn't be on the program. ... We have some of the lowest number of errors in eligibility determination."</p>

<p>"(So) we would be transferring something that's working right to something that's broken?" Hughes asked.</p>

<p>"Potentially," Dzielak said.</p>

<p>Two days later, Dzielak turned in his resignation, which is rumored to be forced—not voluntary.</p>

<p>Rep. Steve Holland, D-Plantersville, who used to be the Medicaid chairman when the Democrats controlled the House, pointed out that Mississippi has the most beneficiaries per capita on Medicaid and also one of the lowest administrative costs to run the program in the country.</p>

<p>"I would just submit to the committee for your consideration right before Santa Claus comes to see you or if he does, that you search your heart very carefully before you make a harebrained mistake of tearing up one of the best eligibility systems in America," Holland said.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Health Advocacy Program polled more than 600 Mississippians about the transfer in eligibility verification and found that 53 percent opposed the transfer to MDHS.</p>

<p>"The results of this poll make it clear that a vast majority of Mississippians do not support moving Medicaid eligibility determination to MDHS or reducing Medicaid coverage. Also, the poll strongly indicates that the public tolerance for political gamesmanship with our Medicaid program is low," Roy Mitchell, executive director of the program, said.</p>

<p>By Imani Khayyam</p>

<p>"Mississippi legislators who fail to recognize that Mississippians trust and value our state Medicaid program, do so at their own political peril."</p>

<p>Republicans constantly express frustration at the ballooning Medicaid budget, always asking the agency to cut costs. The division will ask for another deficit appropriation in the new year.</p>

<p>Rep. Becky Currie, R-Brookhaven, asked both managed-care companies in the state, United Healthcare and Magnolia, if the Division of Medicaid sanctioned them for violating state Medicaid laws.</p>

<p>The answer from leaders of both companies in December hearings was a resounding "no." Currie expressed frustration on behalf of several medical providers in her district who serve Medicaid recipients but have to wait to get reimbursed or credentialed by the managed-care companies outside the 60-day window prescribed in state law—or never do. She plans to introduce legislation to force the companies to comply with state law or not be compensated.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be all fluffy because there's nothing at all fluffy going on with managed care. We've got to do better, and obviously y'all have got another contract even though your costs have gone up," Currie told the CEO of Magnolia Mississippi in December.</p>

<p>"We have got to put something in this ... bill that sanctions them when they don't obey the law for credentialing and (when) they don't pay the providers for their work," Currie said.</p>

<p>Speaker Gunn said in a statement to the Jackson Free Press that the Medicaid budget "is a big concern."</p>

<p>"It continues to grow, and this needs to be addressed," he said.</p>

<p>Declaring War on 'Gangs'</p>

<p>Sheriffs, investigators and prosecutors in the state plan to push their gang bill, which died in conference last year, once again in 2018. Tony Lawrence, the Jackson County district attorney on the Gulf Coast, said the legislation would address the state's "gang problem."</p>

<p>A full archive of the JFP's "Preventing Violence" series, supported by grants from the Solutions Journalism Network. Photo of Zeakyy Harrington by Imani Khayyam.</p>

<p>The legislation would widen the state's existing gang law, expanding the definition of gangs and criminal gang activity, as well as adding an additional charge for criminal gang activity. Lawrence told the Jackson Free Press that the legislation is intended to dissuade gangs from recruiting members and hurting or threatening former gang members who cooperate as state witnesses.</p>

<p>The state's gang law already has enhanced penalties for crimes connected to gang activities, but the new legislation would make criminal gang activity a separate charge altogether, meaning more time behind bars for those convictions.</p>

<p>In 2015, Lawrence said he had two gang-related murders in his county, which motivated him, along with local law enforcement, to "declare war on gangs." Since then, the DA said he realized he needs changes in state law to prosecute gang activity. The State of Mississippi still has the burden of proof in cases, but if prosecutors can connect criminal activity to gangs using the new legislation, the sentences would be potentially longer.</p>

<p>"We're trying to make sure that the law will fit those kind of actions, and hopefully gang members will realize that it's not going to be tolerated anymore," Lawrence told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Those convicted under the new criminal gang-activity charge would have to serve at least 50 percent of their sentences before they are eligible for any kind of program or parole.</p>

<p>"Prosecutors believe that if you're convicted of criminal gang activity that it should be a day-for-day crime, like certain crimes we have in Mississippi, but I don't know if we will be able to convince enough legislators to make it day-for-day," Lawrence said. "But we certainly believe it should be a crime of violence, which would mean you have to serve at least 50 percent of your crime before you could be eligible for any kind of program that will release you early."</p>

<p>A long-form look at the problems of trying kids as adults—and coercing their confessions.</p>

<p>While the intent of the legislation is also to dissuade gangs from recruiting youth, Lawrence said the bill will not change or address any parts of youth-court law, or pick out certain crimes where youth are eligible to be tried as adults. Currently, if a minor commits one of several crimes listed in state law, he or she can be charged as an adult in circuit court. Ultimately, the legislation will enact harsher sentencing for men and women found to be in violation of state law and connected to a gang—which would be easier to prove under the new gang law.</p>

<p>Research shows that three strategies work for early intervention for youth at-risk for gang involvement.</p>

<p>"The first strategy is to intervene at the individual level with at-risk children, particularly disruptive children. The second strategy is family prevention, and the third strategy is school- and community-level prevention," a 2010 research brief by James Howell for the U.S. Department of Justice says.</p>

<p>Lawrence could not say whether harsher sentencing works for gang members or if other states have tried the approach Mississippi is considering.</p>

<p>"I don't know what other states are doing. I know it's a problem in other states. My response to that would be here's one thing I do know: If I have an individual who's committing acts of violence in the community, and I put him in jail, the one thing I do know (is) he is not going to commit acts of violence in the community because he's in jail," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't need research to tell me that if I have a violent gang member participating in criminal gang activity in the streets, if we put him in jail, we've made the streets safer."</p>

<p>Many prisons, however, are known for gang activity, and prisoners often come out of prison engaging in more violent crime than when they went in.</p>

<p>"People who join gangs in prison are also more likely to reoffend and to do so more quickly, thereby undermining rehabilitation efforts," researchers David Skarbek and Courtney Michaluk noted in an article for Politico on the importance of breaking up the largest prisons in the U.S. in order to weaken prison gangs.</p>

<p>Lawrence said prosecutors are not trying to create more problems, but simply want the ability to get the people they know are committing crimes, who they know are affiliated with a gang in some way, behind bars.</p>

<p>A Crippled Crime Lab</p>

<p>Mississippi's state crime lab is in desperate need of funds and personnel. So far, proposed budgets do not include a pay bump for the medical examiner, but Joel Smith, president of the state's prosecutors' association, said they desperately need the funds.</p>

<p>"It's important for prosecutors to be able to have an autopsy completed in a prompt fashion, and it's important also not just for the prosecution of the case but it's important for a victim's family to be able to receive closure in criminal cases," Smith told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Three medical examiners currently work in the state crime lab, housed in the Department of Public Safety. Smith said the office is at risk of losing two of the three medical examiners.</p>

<p>"We've reached a crisis level because in a state where the numbers support for us to have five, six, seven medical examiners, right now we have three, and are in danger of losing two of the three at this point, so if that happened, we'd be down to one medical examiner," Smith said.</p>

<p>"So 'crisis' is a word that's often thrown around or sometimes too often thrown around, but it definitely fits as it pertains to the status of the medical examiner's office in Mississippi. They do great work; they just need additional people there to be able to handle cases they see day in and day out."</p>

<p>The National Association of Medical Examiners recommends a maximum of 250 autopsies per year. In 2016, Mississippi's three medical examiners did 1,500, DPS Commissioner Marshall Fisher told the Jackson Free Press in 2017.</p>

<p>Last year, a criminal-justice reform bill died after Bryant vetoed it, saying it allowed habitual offenders, inmates convicted of their third felony, to be eligible for parole after serving 25 percent of the sentence.</p>

<p>The legislation would have prohibited law-enforcement officials and judges to throw Mississippians in jail for their inability to pay fines; it would also clear the way for nonviolent offenders to be released early. On the first day of the new session, Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, re-committed the bill back to his Judiciary B Committee, signaling its chance at new life in 2018.</p>

<h1 id="metooatthemsleg">MeToo at the #MSLeg?</h1>

<p>In December, House Education Committee Chairman John Moore, R-Brandon, abruptly retired from the Legislature in the midst of an investigation into sexual-harassment claims, leading the House leadership to institute sexual-harassment training in the new year.</p>

<p>When Speaker Gunn's office received word of the allegations against Moore, he alerted the House's outside counsel to follow protocol and begin an investigation. But Meg Annison, the speaker's communication director, told the Jackson Free Press that once Moore resigned, the investigation stopped.</p>

<p>Gunn's management committee adopted and implemented a harassment policy in 2013. The three-page document outlines where House staff and members should report complaints to and the process for investigations.</p>

<p>The Senate has no specific written policy. The Senate rules only state: "Complaints with respect to any misconduct, inefficiency or omission by the Secretary, officials or employees of the Senate shall be heard by the Rules Committee."</p>

<p>Senate President Pro Tempore Terry Burton, R-Newton, said all complaints, not just those for sexual harassment, go through the Senate Rules Committee. Senators have not taken sexual-harassment training courses in recent years. After news of Moore's retirement and investigation broke, Burton said the Senate might consider training in the new year.</p>

<p>"We are talking about it and contemplating, and it is a possibility," he told the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>Roads and Bridges, Redux</p>

<p>Funding for the state's infrastructure will come up in 2018 after the late-night fall out between the House and the Senate in 2017, which ended in no extra funding for roads or bridges. Gunn has been outspoken about his support for plans to divert additional state dollars to roads and bridges. The Senate Transportation Committee, chaired by Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland, held a meeting this summer to look at all the options for possible tax increases and diversions to fun infrastructure. The meeting signaled the Senate's willingness to work on potential solutions in 2018.</p>

<p>Gunn formed a study committee this summer to look at the possibility of a state lottery. The results appeared mixed at the group's November meeting. Rep. Richard Bennett, R-Long Beach, said the committee was not recommending for or against the lottery but instead laying out all options to implement the lottery and including research that shows its economic impact on the state's economy and on Mississippians.</p>

<p>State economist Darrin Webb estimates that annual net revenue from the lottery would equal between $82.6 million and $93.8 million in net gain in state revenue. However, a lottery would also disproportionately affect lower-income people in the state.</p>

<p>"Mississippi is already plagued by people making poor choices, including decisions regarding their health, family planning and education (and) training. A Mississippi lottery means the State will be investing in and encouraging individuals who have limited incomes to make poor financial decisions," Webb told the House committee in November.</p>

<p>Gunn also proposed allowing part of the online sales-tax revenue, which Amazon is now diverting to the State, for infrastructure. The Legislature could also increase the gas tax, but Republican appetite to raise taxes ahead of an election year is low. Reeves and Gunn both seem open to working on infrastructure funding the new year, however.</p>

<p>"There are a few major issues out there, like roads and bridges, and I am hopeful we'll be able to come to an agreement on that and other services that are core functions of government," Reeves said in the statement to the Jackson Free Press late in 2017.</p>

<p>Gunn echoed that sentiment.</p>

<p>"Infrastructure is something we believe is a primary function of government," he said in a statement. "The House has shown a commitment to finding solutions to the problem."</p>

<p>In November 2015, Brad "Kamikaze" Franklin gathered many of his comrades in the local music scene to discuss how to further the city's creative arts. With festivals such as South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, and the A3C festivals in Atlanta, Ga., operating in the region, Franklin says he began asking himself, "Why don't we have a premier festival for artists? These organizers in Austin and Atlanta aren't any smarter than us. Why can't this be done in Jackson?"</p>

<p>Now, in its third year, the week-long Jackson Indie Music Week festival is held across Jackson in various venues. It features showcases, industry panels, award shows and other events, and as transitioned into a staple for many in the community.</p>

<p>Jackson natives Franklin Garrad Lee, and Thabi Moyo, along with Detroit native Donyale Walls, have been the driving forces behind the event since its inception. Lee, Franklin and Walls are returning for what they call JIM Week 2018, which takes place from Jan. 7 through Jan. 14 and features more than 50 performers.</p>

<p>"The first year, I'll never forget the feeling of seeing so many people at Lucky Town (Brewing Company) for the kick-off party," Lee says. "I knew that first night that we were providing something that people wanted, and that the city was going to show love."</p>

<p>Lee and Cody Cox, founders of record labels Elegant Trainwreck and Homework Town, devised one of the centerpieces of JIM Week by expanding on their multi-genre concert series, "The Blender." This year, "The Blender" is Wednesday, Jan. 10, at Hal &amp; Mal's, Martin's Restaurant &amp; Bar and One Block East.</p>

<p>A number of events are returning in 2018, including educational panels "Do the Knowledge" and "Many Moons," which features women in the entertainment industry sharing their experiences. JIM Week organizers are also expanding its repertoire and support system.</p>

<p>The festival has added sponsors such as radio station Y101 and Guitar Center to the roster, as well as new participating venues, including Spacecamp, CS's Restaurant, Underground 119, the Kundi Compound, The Flamingo and Podastery Studios, to name a few.</p>

<p>This year will also be the first to feature a gospel brunch on Sunday, Jan. 14, at The Iron Horse Grill and "The Beat Sale" at Offbeat on Saturday, Jan. 13, where beat producers will show off their latest work for audiences and artists looking to buy new backing tracks.</p>

<p>"I want slow, steady, consistent growth—not the 'popular' growth that comes with having big names or flavor-of-the-month type of events," Franklin says. "We wanted to grow this using (the city's) talent first and get folks used to seeing us before we took that next step. ... Platforms like SXSW are becoming more corporate, and the true indie artist has gotten frozen out. That's where JIM Week comes in."</p>

<p>Franklin says that he also hopes the festival will continue to be an economic driver for the city of Jackson, bringing guests that spend time and money at local venues, hotels, restaurants and retailers. And as for what's coming next, he already has a few ideas.</p>

<p>"Bigger events, newer events, bigger sponsors, and hopefully, bigger names in the indie music scene that we can bring in," Franklin says.</p>

<p>Jackson Indie Music Week is Jan. 7-14 throughout Jackson. Single-day passes are $25 each, and all-event passes are $50. For a schedule of events, visit jxnindiemusic.com.</p>

<h2 id="counciloksmunicipaljudgesdebatesbonds">Council OKs Municipal Judges, Debates Bonds</h2>

<p>JACKSON — June Hardwick, a Hinds County municipal judge under the first Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, returned to that post in late December after the Jackson City Council confirmed her and re-confirmed two other existing municipal judges, Henry C. Clay III and Ali Shamsiddeen.</p>

<p>Judge Gerald Mumford will leave the bench to become the Hinds County Attorney after winning that seat in November. Judges in municipal court have a range of duties from solemnizing marriages and overseeing traffic court to issuing warrants and setting bonds.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba presented June Hardwick's nomination to the council on Dec. 19, and she drew unanimous approval. The attorney has also worked closely with the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement, which the mayor's father helped start in Jackson.</p>

<p>Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps asked Hardwick what she would do differently this time around.</p>

<p>"I think that I would hold JPD maybe more accountable when they're present in the courtroom with information that a judge needs," Hardwick said of the police department.</p>

<p>Hardwick also wants municipal court to start using 21st-century technology, particularly for payments.</p>

<p>Clay has been on the municipal-court bench for 23 years. As a result, the council did not question Clay, instead complimenting and thanking him for his service before unanimously approving him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Clay is the kind of judge we need," Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes said. "... I remember when he first became a judge since it was majority white almost. He got there, and people respected his knowledge, and they respected how he worked with people."</p>

<p>After the vote, the mayor said he hoped that municipal judges would tighten bonds to ensure people who've already been issued a bond do not get a second one if they come before the court again because that violates the law.</p>

<p>Bonds came up again in the confirmation hearing for Ali Shamsiddeen at the special council meeting on Dec. 21. Shamsiddeen did not mirror Lumumba's request for tougher bonds, saying he wants to ensure they are assigned constitutionally and not punitively.</p>

<p>"I remember a time we as African Americans, if you got arrested for something, you could forget about seeing the light of day," he said. "The Constitution says bonds are not supposed to be used as punishment. You cannot punish a person who has not been convicted of a crime. But, we see in municipalities where bonds are being levied against defendants unconstitutionally."</p>

<p>Shamsiddeen used an example of a young person from a single-parent family breaking into a car or a house and whether or not it would be fair to give him a $200,000 bond without looking at his situation holistically. He believes "cookie-cutter situations" are unjust when it comes to bond and said he is willing to withstand pushback from people who think otherwise.</p>

<p>"I'm willing to take the flak as long as I can hold up the Constitution and say, 'This is what the Constitution says,'" Shamsiddeen said.</p>

<p>Before being voted in unanimously, Shamsiddeen said he was very close the mayor's late father under whom he worked when completing law school. He hopes to emulate the late Lumumba's people-first approach.</p>

<p>"He would defend the people more stringently even more than he'd defend himself," Shamsiddeen said.</p>

<h2 id="apnewsbreaksessionstoendpolicythatletlegalpotflourish">AP NewsBreak: Sessions to End Policy That Let Legal Pot Flourish</h2>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Attorney General Jeff Sessions is rescinding the Obama-era policy that had paved the way for legalized marijuana to flourish in states across the country, two people with knowledge of the decision told The Associated Press. Sessions will instead let federal prosecutors where pot is legal decide how aggressively to enforce federal marijuana law, the people said.</p>

<p>The people familiar with the plan spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it before an announcement expected Thursday.</p>

<p>The move by President Donald Trump's attorney general likely will add to confusion about whether it's OK to grow, buy or use marijuana in states where pot is legal, since long-standing federal law prohibits it. It comes days after pot shops opened in California, launching what is expected to become the world's largest market for legal recreational marijuana and as polls show a solid majority of Americans believe the drug should be legal.</p>

<p>While Sessions has been carrying out a Justice Department agenda that follows Trump's top priorities on such issues as immigration and opioids, the changes to pot policy reflect his own concerns. Trump's personal views on marijuana remain largely unknown.</p>

<p>Sessions, who has assailed marijuana as comparable to heroin and has blamed it for spikes in violence, had been expected to ramp up enforcement. Pot advocates argue that legalizing the drug eliminates the need for a black market and would likely reduce violence, since criminals would no longer control the marijuana trade.</p>

<p>The Obama administration in 2013 announced it would not stand in the way of states that legalize marijuana, so long as officials acted to keep it from migrating to places where it remained outlawed and out of the hands of criminal gangs and children. Sessions is rescinding that memo, written by then-Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole, which had cleared up some of the uncertainty about how the federal government would respond as states began allowing sales for recreational and medical purposes.</p>

<p>The pot business has since become a sophisticated, multimillion-dollar industry that helps fund schools, educational programs and law enforcement. Eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use, and California's sales alone are projected to bring in $1 billion annually in tax revenue within several years.</p>

<p>Sessions' policy will let U.S. attorneys across the country decide what kinds of federal resources to devote to marijuana enforcement based on what they see as priorities in their districts, the people familiar with the decision said.</p>

<p>Sessions and some law enforcement officials in states such as Colorado blame legalization for a number of problems, including drug traffickers that have taken advantage of lax marijuana laws to hide in plain sight, illegally growing and shipping the drug across state lines, where it can sell for much more. The decision was a win for pot opponents who had been urging Sessions to take action.</p>

<p>"There is no more safe haven with regard to the federal government and marijuana, but it's also the beginning of the story and not the end," said Kevin Sabet, president and CEO of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, who was among several anti-marijuana advocates who met with Sessions last month. "This is a victory. It's going to dry up a lot of the institutional investment that has gone toward marijuana in the last five years."</p>

<p>Threats of a federal crackdown have united liberals who object to the human costs of a war on pot with conservatives who see it as a states' rights issue. Some in law enforcement support a tougher approach, but a bipartisan group of senators in March urged Sessions to uphold existing marijuana policy. Others in Congress have been seeking ways to protect and promote legal pot businesses.</p>

<p>Marijuana advocates quickly condemned Sessions' move as a return to outdated drug-war policies that unduly affected minorities.</p>

<p>Sessions "wants to maintain a system that has led to tremendous injustice ... and that has wasted federal resources on a huge scale," said Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance. "If Sessions thinks that makes sense in terms of prosecutorial priorities, he is in a very bizarre ideological state, or a deeply problematic one."</p>

<p>A task force Sessions convened to study pot policy made no recommendations for upending the legal industry but instead encouraged Justice Department officials to keep reviewing the Obama administration's more hands-off approach to marijuana enforcement, something Sessions promised to do since he took office.</p>

<p>The change also reflects yet another way in which Sessions, who served as a federal prosecutor at the height of the drug war in Mobile, Alabama, has reversed Obama-era criminal justice policies that aimed to ease overcrowding in federal prisons and contributed to a rethinking of how drug criminals were prosecuted and sentenced. While his Democratic predecessor Eric Holder told federal prosecutors to avoid seeking long mandatory minimum sentences when charging certain lower level drug offenders, for example, Sessions issued an order demanding the opposite, telling them to pursue the most serious charges possible against most suspects.</p>
