By Taylor Cooper | The Brunswick News | June 27, 2018
The American Civil Liberties Union filed an amendment Tuesday to a lawsuit lodged in U.S. District Court over the county’s cash bail system, claiming State Court Public Defender Reid Zeh required a $2,500 payment to represent a man charged with a misdemeanor.
Robert Cox couldn’t afford an attorney, so Zeh was appointed to represent him in State Court, but still sought payment from his mother, Barbara Hamilton, the ACLU alleges in the complaint. Glynn County taxpayers cover the cost of a State Court public defender to represent those who can’t afford an attorney in misdemeanor cases and traffic issues.
Initial filings in the case claim the county’s cash bail system — in which someone who is arrested by county law enforcement may pay a predetermined amount to secure their release from jail until their first court date — is unconstitutional.
The system discriminates against those who are “financially strapped,” as anyone who can’t pay could be stuck in jail for weeks or months with no opportunity to request a hearing to seek their release, the ACLU claims in a press release.
“Glynn County officials continue to operate two different criminal justice systems — one for people with money and another for people without,” Andrea Woods, Staff Attorney with the ACLU’s Criminal Law Reform Project, stated in the release. “Reid Zeh has not only ignored his duty to advocate for poor arrestees who need his help, he has abused this position of trust by extorting people like Ms. Hamilton when they seek his help for themselves or a loved one.”
The ACLU alleges that Glynn County, Glynn County Sheriff Neal Jump and Glynn County Chief Magistrate Judge Alex Atwood violated citizens’ 14th Amendment rights to equal protection and due process by administering the bail system. Zeh and the county are further alleged to have violated indigent misdemeanor arrestees’ 6th Amendment rights to counsel and equal protection through counsel.
According to the release, the ACLU is seeking an “immediate and permanent change” to the bail and misdemeanor public defender system.
Glynn County and Jump contended in court documents filed in April that they are not in any position to change the misdemeanor cash bond process, as it was created by the state legislature. Regardless, the county maintained the system is constitutional and “provides a timely, meaningful and individualized determination of indigency for bail-determination purposes,” in its response to the initial filing.
Attorneys for the county and Jump also claimed an injunction sought by the ACLU in the case didn’t adequately specify “the acts it seeks to restrain or require.” It would not be able to prove an injunction against the state necessary, either, the county’s attorneys claimed in their response.</p>

<p>JEFFERSONVILLE, GA – The ACLU of Georgia has filed an amicus brief in Twiggs County Juvenile Court in support of Suzeanna and Matthew Brill to protect their fundamental right to parent and obtain the medical treatment they need for their chronically ill son, who suffers from daily epileptic seizures. The brief asks the Court to reunite the parents with their child immediately.
The Brills had sought the care of a doctor, administered the prescribed medicine, and turned to the only legal form of medical marijuana in Georgia – THC oil. None of it worked. To end the horror of helplessly watching their child convulse several times a day, the Brills treated their son’s epilepsy in the only way proven to be most effective: smoking the plant itself which immediately stopped his seizures.
For over 70 days, he remained seizure-free as a result of his parents’ decision to medicate him with marijuana. Yet, Twiggs County Sheriff Darren Mitchum arrested and jailed the Briggs on April 20, 2018, which resulted in their chronically ill son being ripped from them and placed in government custody without the only medicine that had stopped the seizures. That very day, their 15-year old son suffered a seizure, was hospitalized, and flatlined 15 times.
“Georgia is tearing vulnerable children away from their parents and placing them in danger based on inexcusable ignorance about the proven medical benefits of marijuana use,” stated Sean J. Young, Legal Director of the ACLU of Georgia. "Already, 31 states have passed comprehensive medical marijuana reform that would have allowed the Brills to give their son the necessary medical treatment he urgently needs.

<p>BRUNSWICK, GA — The ACLU of Georgia and the American Civil Liberties Union have filed a motion to amend the complaint in their federal class action lawsuit against Glynn County, Glynn County Sheriff E. Neal Jump, Glynn County Chief Magistrate Judge Alex Atwood, and B. Reid Zeh, III, seeking an immediate and permanent change to an unconstitutional cash bail and misdemeanor public defender system that discriminates against people who are financially strapped.
In the amended complaint, Plaintiff Barbara Hamilton alleges that Attorney B. Reid Zeh, III, illegally required a private payment of $2,500 to represent her son on a misdemeanor charge even though the taxpayers of Glynn County already pay Zeh to represent impoverished individuals unable to afford an attorney.
“Glynn County officials continue to operate two different criminal justice systems - one for people with money and another for people without,” stated Andrea Woods, Staff Attorney with the ACLU’s Criminal Law Reform Project. “Reid Zeh has not only ignored his duty to advocate for poor arrestees who need his help, he has abused this position of trust by extorting people like Ms. Hamilton when they seek his help for themselves or a loved one.”
In a sworn court document, Ms. Hamilton stated, “[My son] Robert informed me that Mr. Zeh would not represent him unless he came up with $2,500 to pay Mr. Zeh. Robert could not pay, so I did. … I was not aware that Mr. Zeh was already paid by Glynn County to take misdemeanor criminal cases for indigent persons. I relied on Mr. Zeh’s representation that this money was necessary before he would help Robert.”
As the lawsuit explains, people accused of misdemeanor crimes in Glynn County are treated differently based on the amount of money they have, which violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
"The Glynn County misdemeanor public defender system holds hostage the freedom of individuals arrested for misdemeanors," stated Sean J. Young, Legal Director of the ACLU of Georgia, "leaving those who are financially strapped without any advocate to assist them as required by law.”

<p>By Rhonda Cook | Atlanta Journal-Constitution | June 20, 2018</p>

<p>Prison was a silent, isolating place for Jerry Coen despite being locked up in a facility that housed 1,150 other inmates.</p>

<p>Deaf since birth and fluent only in American Sign Language, Coen had no way to learn the rules or to take part in programs that would help him once released.</p>

<p>At a disciplinary hearing for refusing to change bunks, Coen’s hands were cuffed behind his back, leaving him unable to communicate. He ended up in a dark isolation cell where he missed meals because he didn’t hear when food trays were dropped off and couldn’t ask the officers, who didn’t know sign language, to allow him to take a shower.</p>

<p>“When they put me in the hole, they tried to force me to read lips. I couldn’t communicate,” Coen told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution through an interpreter.</p>

<p>06/18/2018 — Atlanta, GA - Jerry T. Coen speaks about his time in prison at the American Civil Liberties Union Atlanta office, Monday, June 18, 2018. Coen was born deaf. He recently spent 10 years at a Georgia penitentiary. The national and state chapters of the ALCU will sue the Georgia Department of Corrections on behalf of Coen. Coen says he was unable to communicate while in prison because the staff rejected his plea for a translator. Coen says he missed out on learning while in prison because of his lack of assistance with communication. ALYSSA POINTER/ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM </p>

<p>“The guards don’t care,” he said. “They figure if you’re incarcerated, (you can) figure it out.”</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit on behalf of Coen and 13 other deaf or hearing-impaired Georgia inmates in U.S. District Court in Macon. The suit against the Georgia Department of Corrections and the Department of Community Supervision says Georgia is violating the Americans with Disabilities Act and the U.S. Constitution’s protections against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

<p>“Deaf individuals deserve the same opportunities as other incarcerated individuals to access educational and other programs that can reduce their sentences, get out of taxpayer-funded prisons, and rebuild their lives,” said Sean J. Young, Legal Director for the ACLU of Georgia. Central State Prison’s failure to provide those opportunities violates the Eighth Amendment, he said.</p>

<p>Corrections officials said that fewer than 1,000 inmates in Georgia have some degree of hearing loss; they are housed at five of the state’s 35 private and public institutions. Most of the impaired inmates have hearing loss in one ear and 69 cannot cannot hear at all. Corrections officials said inmates who use American Sign Language “have access to qualified interpreters.</p>

<p>The state Department of Corrections declined to comment specifically on the lawsuit.</p>

<p>The Department of Community Supervision also did not comment on the suit but said in a statement that their officers, who supervise 259,000 parolees and probationers, “are sensitive to the specific challenges and needs of each individual under supervision, including those with physical and/or mental impairments.” The agency said some DCS officers are fluent in American Sign Language and the agency also uses outside interpreters.</p>

<p>The suit says deaf or hearing-impaired inmates, especially those who use only American Sign Language, are even more isolated in prison and are at risk of harm from other inmates, of being disciplined for breaking rules they don’t understand and of losing parole opportunities because they can’t take classes. The suit notes that many inmates who are deaf cannot read or speak English, that ASL Language is their only language.</p>

<p>“American Sign Language and English are entirely different languages, complete with their own grammar, syntax and structure,” Talila Lewis, director of volunteers for Helping Educate to Advance the Rights of Deaf Communities, said.</p>

<p>The lawsuit said providing ASL-fluent inmates, parolees and probationers with documents written in English “is akin to giving documents in Japanese to a person who understands only English.”</p>

<p>The suit said these inmates don’t have access to prison, parole or probation rules, which subjects them “to arbitrary discipline, punishments, abuses and a quick return to prison. They are denied access to religious, educational and vocational programs that would make them eligible for earlier release, and better prepared for a successful return to society. As a result, they are incarcerated more frequently, remain in prison longer and return to prison faster,” the complaint said.</p>

<p>The deaf inmates are also at a disadvantage because prisons don’t have have visual alarms or bed-shaking devices to alert them to emergencies, cell block searches, meals or classes, the suit said. They cannot tell prison staff if they have medical or mental health issues or if they have been threatened by other inmates. The suit argued that prisons don’t have video phones so inmates can stay in touch with family; in one instance an inmate could not get paroled because he had no way to contact relatives to ensure he had a place to live once released.</p>

<p>State corrections officials said inmates have access to TTY devices, hearing aids and video relay services that allow them to communicate with those outside prison walls.</p>

<p>Coen, 44, served 10 years for aggravated battery and false imprisonment and is now serving five years probation. He said he understands about 300 words written in English and is comfortable only in communicating through sign language. Coen said his probation officer will not use a video interpreting service available to the DCS and instead wants him to bring his mother to translate.</p>

<p>“I wanted to know the rules. I didn’t want to go back to prison,” Coen said. “Probation is scary. They can put you back in prison for anything.”</p>

<p>The lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union was filed on behalf of 14 hearing-impaired Georgia inmates. Here is what two of them had to say, according to the legal documents:</p>

<p>Ricardo Harris, 38, is serving life for 2013 Cobb County murder. He filed a grievance last December, saying there was no American Sign Language interpreter to explain his diagnosis after a medical emergency at Augusta State Medical Prison or his prognosis and treatment. In a second grievance, Harris complained he missed work and attending required programs because the prison did not provide visual or tactile alarms for him and other deaf and hard-of-hearing inmates.</p>

<p>Jorae Smith, 22 is serving 20 years at Central State Prison for kidnapping and other crimes. He spent eight months in solitary confinement for his protection. “During this time, he was completely isolated from other inmates, meaning that he could not get any information from more literate deaf incarcerated people or others who might provide some assistance to deaf and hard-of-hearing people in the general population,” the suit said. “As a Deaf person, the extreme isolation of solitary was magnified for Mr. J. Smith, who had virtually no sensory stimulation during this time.”</p>

<h2 id="callsforantidiscriminationlawreligiousprotectionsfollowruling">Calls for anti-discrimination law, religious protections follow ruling</h2>

<p>By Jill Nolin | Moultrie Observer | June 4, 2018</p>

<p>ATLANTA – The nation’s high court may have sided with a Christian baker who refused to create a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, but civil rights advocates still found cause for celebration in what was widely viewed as a limited decision on the issue.</p>

<p>“The ruling emphatically does not give businesses a blank check to discriminate against gay people under some twisted theory of the First Amendment,” said Sean J. Young, legal director with the ACLU of Georgia.</p>

<p>Rather, Young pointed to several passages – endorsed by eight of the justices – that said gay and lesbian people shouldn’t be subjected to such indignities when navigating the marketplace.</p>

<p>The ruling prompted advocates to renew the call for a state anti-discrimination law in Georgia. Colorado law prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</p>

<p>“I hope that our legislators will look carefully at the lessons to be learned from this Supreme Court decision and will move forward in the next session to protect people of faith but also to protect members of the LGBT community,” Jeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality, said at a press conference held Monday at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights.</p>

<p>“This decision, I believe, supports the contention that all people are worthy of protection against overt discrimination,” Graham said. “And we have a unique opportunity in Georgia to lead the country on finding that middle ground where all people can be protected.”</p>

<p>Graham said he hoped the ruling would begin to chip away at what he called a “false dichotomy” that pits people of faith against gays and lesbians when he said many people identify as both.</p>

<p>Georgia lawmakers have been wrestling with religious liberty measures for several years. They passed a bill in 2016 that would have allowed some faith-based groups to deny services to someone if doing so violated their beliefs, but Republican Gov. Nathan Deal struck down the bill under tremendous pressure from the business community.</p>

<p>If Monday’s decision emboldens religious freedom supporters in Georgia, it will be a different governor who determines the fate of such a proposal.</p>

<p>Deal is finishing his last year in office, and the two candidates competing for the Republican nomination for governor – Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle and Secretary of State Brian Kemp – have both pledged to support religious liberty measures.</p>

<p>“The Supreme Court confirmed what we already knew: The Constitution protects religious exercise and expression,” Cagle said Monday. “There’s no clause that says ‘unless the left deems it offensive.’”</p>

<p>From Kemp: “As governor, I’ll stand up to the radical left and politically correct. We will never apologize for protecting religious liberty and living out our faith.”</p>

<p>The Democratic gubernatorial candidate, former House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, has said she would veto measures that she says enshrine discrimination in state law.</p>

<p>“Under my leadership, every Georgian will know they can live and work in a state that will treat them with dignity, respect, and allow them to prosper, no matter who they are,” Abrams said Monday.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court left for another day tough questions on how the country should balance someone’s religious rights with protections from discrimination for others.</p>

<p>The justices did, however, find with a 7-to-2 vote that the Colorado Civil Rights Commission violated Denver-area baker Jack Phillips’ First Amendment rights when it demonstrated what it called an anti-religious bias.</p>

<p>That commission heard a complaint against Phillips after a same-sex couple, Charlie Craig and Dave Mullins, reported that the baker refused to make a customized cake for their wedding reception in 2012.</p>

<p>Mike Griffin, who is a Baptist pastor and lobbyist for the Georgia Baptist Mission Board, said the ruling lends credence to claims that Christians are being unfairly targeted for their traditional views on marriage.</p>

<p>“There seems to be a horrendous bias against Christians who are just trying to practice their faith as orthodox Christianity has for 2,000 years,” Griffin said.</p>

<p>The commission’s treatment of the Christian baker, Griffin said, shows why legal protections are needed for the faith community, including in Georgia.</p>

<p>But it remains to be seen whether Monday’s decision will really influence Georgia’s religious liberty debate in a meaningful way. Virginia Galloway with the Faith and Freedom Coalition called the decision a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>“What it really does is just open the door for further cases,” Galloway said. “And then those cases will – one by one – determine the direction we’re going in this country.”</p>

<h2 id="howageorgiateengot5yearsinprisonforstealingapairofshoes">How A Georgia Teen Got 5 Years In Prison For Stealing A Pair Of Shoes</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-03</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/news/how-georgia-teen-got-5-years-prison-stealing-pair-shoes </p>

<p>By Johnny Kaufmann | WABE | June 4, 2018</p>

<p>Some have called teen Dayonn Davis’ sentence for stealing a pair of shoes harsh. According to Georgia law, it could have been longer. The inflexibility of state law for individuals charged with some violent crimes, even if the individual is as young as 13, may have affected Davis’ plea deal. </p>

<p>Dayonn Davis was set to graduate from high school in Columbus, said his lawyer Susan Henderson, but now he’s going to prison.</p>

<p>“He is a good kid that made a really dumb 15-year-old mistake,” she said.</p>

<p>Davis was sentenced to five years in prison and 10 years of probation for stealing a pair of black and white Nike Air Jordan Fives from an acquaintance, according to his lawyer.</p>

<p>A handgun was brought to the robbery, but Henderson argues Davis didn’t know it would be there. Davis’ lawyer said an accomplice, who was later arrested but not charged, brought the weapon.</p>

<p>Sadhana Dailey, senior assistant district attorney for the Muscogee County Superior Court, contends Davis could have killed the acquaintance he stole the shoes from.</p>

<p>“The fact that these robbers were willing to shoot the victim for shoes shows their callousness to another teen’s life and is a danger to anyone who has an item that this defendant or his accomplice wants,” Dailey said in a written statement.</p>

<p>“That’s really when his grades started dropping,” Henderson said. “He became very depressed. I mean, he owns up to the fact that he made a mistake. He has done that from the beginning with me.”</p>

<p>Davis’ sentence has been called harsh. According to Georgia law, it could have been even longer, and without a chance for parole.</p>

<p>The inflexibility of state law for individuals charged with some violent crimes, even if the individual is as young as 13, may have affected the plea deal negotiated between Davis’ lawyers and the prosecutor in the case, criminal justice reform advocates said.</p>

<p>In Georgia, if juveniles are charged with armed robbery, they’re tried as adults and face a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison.</p>

<p>That worried Henderson, who said she wasn’t sure she could win a trial proving Davis didn’t know a gun would be brought to the scene of the robbery.</p>

<p>So, after negotiations between his lawyer and prosecutor Dailey, Davis ultimately pleaded guilty to just robbery. The sentence comes with five years in jail, and the possibility of parole, as well as 10 years of probation.</p>

<p>Henderson said it was a difficult decision for her, Davis and his family.</p>

<p>“To say I won’t second guess that one for the rest of my career is putting it minimally,” Henderson said. “He was a good kid … he’d never been in any trouble prior to this.”</p>

<p>With the possibility of years in prison looming, even if they’re innocent, defendants may feel pressure to take a plea deal, according to Christopher Bruce, policy counsel for the ACLU of Georgia.</p>

<p>“Mandatory minimums make sure prosecutors have the upper-hand when it comes to plea agreements,” he said.</p>

<p>The “harsh” sentence against Davis isn’t an “outlier” in Georgia, said Bruce, especially for young black men.</p>

<p>“We need to look deep in ourselves and determine, should we continue to jail and imprison children, or should we give them the help that they need to be productive citizens of society,” he said.</p>

<p>The felony on Davis’ record, and the records of other young men in similar situations, will make it more difficult for them to get a job or attend college, Bruce said.</p>

<p>“You are literally limiting the ability of someone to survive in the state once you charge them with something, especially at such a young age.”</p>

<p>“The teen victim could have been killed,” she said. “Young people are capable of killing for as little as shoes.”</p>

<h2 id="theacluofgeorgiasuesthesecretaryofstateforremovinglatinacandidatefromthetuesdaymay22primaryballot">The ACLU of Georgia Sues the Secretary of State for Removing Latina Candidate from the Tuesday, May 22 Primary Ballot</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/aclu-georgia-sues-secretary-state-removing-latina-candidate-tuesday-may-22-primary </p>

<p>Secretary of State's Action Ensures No Democratic Opposition in November General Election </p>

<p>ATLANTA – The ACLU of Georgia sued the Secretary of State in Superior Court of Fulton County, appealing the Secretary of State’s Friday decision to kick off the ballot Maria Palacios, a Latina-American who has lived in Georgia since 2009 and became a United States citizen last year. Ms. Palacios, a Democrat, is running for state representative in House District 29, a district that is 60% people of color with a 43% Hispanic population. Because Ms. Palacios is the only candidate in the Democratic primary and no write-in candidates are allowed in primaries, forcing her off of the ballot would ensure no Democratic opposition in the November general election.</p>

<p>Georgia’s constitution requires candidates to be a “citizen of the state” for two years prior to being elected to office. The ACLU of Georgia argued to the Secretary of State that Ms. Palacios satisfies the definition of “citizen of the state” because she has resided in Georgia since 2009.</p>

<p>“For centuries, courts around the country have recognized that ‘citizen of a state’ means someone who is either a resident or a domiciliary of that state. The Georgia Constitution requires that candidates for the State House of Representatives be citizens of the state for at least two years at the time of the election,” stated the ACLU of Georgia in its filing to the Superior Court. “Maria Palacios has undisputedly been both a resident and domiciliary of the State of Georgia since 2009, [therefore] she satisfies that legal requirement.”</p>

<p>The Secretary of State, on the other hand, has asserted without citing any judicial authority that Ms. Palacios doesn’t satisfy the constitutional qualification since she became a US citizen last year. As the petition argued, however, courts around the country have long held that United States citizenship is not required to be a citizen of a state.</p>

<p>“The Georgia Constitution allows longtime Georgia residents who become United States citizens to honorably serve their communities as elected leaders, regardless of their party affiliation or national origin,” stated Sean J. Young, Legal Director of the ACLU of Georgia. “The Secretary of State should uphold the Georgia Constitution’s inclusive vision of democracy, instead of undermining it with deeply flawed legal reasoning.”</p>

<p>The ACLU of Georgia asked the court to reverse the Secretary of State’s decision, and place Ms. Palacios on the November 6, 2018, general election ballot as the Democratic nominee for Georgia State House District 29. The ACLU of Georgia has also asked the court to restore Ms. Palacios to the ballot for the Tuesday, May 22 Democratic Primary, if necessary.</p>

<h2 id="candidatesforgeorgiacourtofappealsgetjudicialwarning">Candidates for Georgia Court of Appeals get judicial warning</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-13</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/news/candidates-georgia-court-appeals-get-judicial-warning </p>

<p>By Rhonda Cook | The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | May 14, 2018</p>

<p>The commission that oversees Georgia judges has issued a warning that candidates for judgeships must remain non-partisan after an Atlanta lawyer running for the Georgia Court of Appeals said publicly that he is a Republican and his opponent is not.</p>

<p>Georgia policy is that judicial races are non-partisan because judges are supposed to preside without any political biases. Candidates must follow the same rules as a sitting judge.</p>

<p>The warning is a rare step for the Georgia Judicial Qualifications Commission, which is the state’s judicial watchdog agency that investigates complaints of misconduct.</p>

<p>Shigley said he brought up his affiliation with the Republican Party only after his opponent, former Dougherty County District Attorney Ken Hodges, released the names of those who have endorsed him, including Republican former U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss who is his campaign chairman.</p>

<p>“I’ve got far more Republican support than he does,” Hodges said, adding, however, that he is also backed by Democrats. “I have bi-partisan support.”</p>

<p>Shigley, however, saw it differently. He believes Hodges was trying to convince “Republicans he was a Republican. We just punched back when we got punched.</p>

<p>“I started out running it (the campaign) … on experience and ideas,” Shigley said. “Then he comes out with all these political endorsements… I tried to even it up.”</p>

<p>The two are running in the only contested state-wide judicial race. Seven other seats are on the May 22 non-partisan ballot, but all are incumbents running unopposed.</p>

<p>“Statewide judicial elections are free of partisanship. …We received emails and phone calls from various people around the state, questioning whether this was over the line or not. I don’t know that it was. We didn’t institute any formal complaint. We felt like it was a question that needed a caution to all the candidates not to ignore that prescription. Easterlin said.</p>

<p>The JQC wrote in a news release posted on its website: “…The commission cautions any judicial candidate against making comments or seeking endorsements which may conflict with the non-partisan duties required of a statewide judge in the state of Georgia.”</p>

<p>In response to a question about his “conservative or liberal views” and whether he is a Republican or a Democrat, Shigley posted on his campaign Facebook page that he is running in a “nonpartisan judicial election. No party affiliation appears on the ballot.”</p>

<p>He goes on to write,” I have been cautioned by the JQC for partisan comments. My family has been mostly Republican since 1856, and I have traditional family values. The other candidate was the Democratic Party nominee for Attorney General in 2010.”</p>

<p>Judicial candidates must walk a fine line in their public comments. Judicial cannons — the code of conduct for judges — limit what they can say, yet they are guaranteed the right to speak freely under the U.S. Constitution. The JQC is charged with determining when the cannons are violated, and the agency has the power to recommend that the Georgia Supreme Court remove a judge who is found to have committed egregious acts.</p>

<p>“Freedom of speech is sacred, and that includes the right of judicial candidates to say things that may be deemed inappropriate,” said Sean Young, legal director of the ACLU of Georgia. “It is up to Georgia voters to weigh in on this ongoing conversation and at the polls. Robust conversations about judicial qualifications and other topics are what strengthen our democracy.”</p>

<p>By Bill Torpy | Atlanta Journal-Constitution | May 7, 2018</p>

<p>More than 100,000 times a day, Brookhaven’s electronic Eyes in the Sky shoot license plates on vehicles rolling through the city.</p>

<p>Images from the 44 cameras are instantly examined and police are told of any hits, anything from serious crimes such as stolen cars or wanted criminals to low-level stuff such as lapsed insurance or expired tags.</p>

<p>Brookhaven’s eye in the sky — 44 cameras watching who goes in and out of the city.</p>

<p>It’s called “GeoFencing,” building a virtual fence around an area so all who enter or exit can be identified.</p>

<p>And then — and here’s the scary part — that data is stored.</p>

<p>This isn’t new. Cops have used license-plate readers for years. The difference here is the pervasiveness of such cameras across the 12-square-mile city and the fact that Georgia Power runs the program.</p>

<p>Last year, a new Georgia Power org contacted Brookhaven with an offer: We have the infrastructure — poles, land rights, electricity and even cameras — and we’ll help you see who’s coming and going.</p>

<p>A power company exec last month told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution: “Georgia Power is focused on offering products and services that meet the needs of our customers.”</p>

<p>This shows how clueless I am. I thought I just needed my lights to shine and my AC to run. I didn’t know I needed the electric company to spy on me.</p>

<p>This does provide a new revenue stream. And seeing that Georgia Power is losing billions on its new nuclear plant, well, who am I to begrudge them scratching out a few extra bucks?</p>

<p>Being concerned about the whole Big Brother thing, I asked Brookhaven for all instances that those cameras caught my minivan trying to sneak through the city. The data shows the time and place of each vehicle, complete with a photo.</p>

<p>Police Maj. Brandon Gurley told me he doesn’t have the data. He said a third party called Vigilant Solutions controls it. Police are made aware only when there is a “hit. ” Then they run a check of the vehicle through the Georgia Crime Information Center. Only those instances become public record, he said.</p>

<p>So far, 12 million licenses have been read in Brookhaven this year. “Approximately 2,100 were for the more serious alerts that we target (i.e. stolen tag, stolen vehicle, wanted persons, missing persons, etc.),” the major told me.</p>

<p>There were probably 70,000 “hits,” Gurley said, but those were for little stuff that police have no time for. Unless, I suppose, they want to.</p>

<p>“We are embracing technology in our efforts to keep crime down,” he added. “We want to send a message to criminals: If you come into Brookhaven, we have tools in place to help catch you.”</p>

<p>Gurley said the program was attractive because it would have been cost-prohibitive for the city to set this up itself. He said officers cannot access the database without a “law enforcement purpose.”</p>

<p>“I understand the concerns,” he said. “I empathize. But I see when and how this is used.”</p>

<p>Now, Maj. Gurley seems like a straight-up guy, and I’m sure he means what he says.</p>

<p>Remember Equifax? The Atlanta-based credit reporting agency got hacked last year and financial data from 145 million consumers was potentially left exposed for scamsters.</p>

<p>But this isn’t necessarily about fraud. It’s about the basic right to be left alone.</p>

<p>“If you’re troubled by people knowing everywhere you go, then this should scare you,” said Sean Young, ACLU Georgia’s legal director. “They’re saying, ‘Trust Big Brother. Big Brother is too busy to track your every move.’ I just don’t buy it.”</p>

<p>Vigilant Solutions, which maintains the data created by the Brookhaven cameras, is “shopping their Big Brother services all over the country,” Young said.</p>

<p>In 2016, Nextgov, a website that tracks technology and government, wrote: “To install a GPS tracking device on your car, your local police department must present a judge with a rationale that meets a Fourth Amendment test and obtain a warrant. But if it wants to query a database to see years of data on where your car was photographed at specific times, it doesn’t need a warrant — just a willingness to send some of your tax dollars to Vigilant Solutions.”</p>

<p>A Vigilant executive told The Washington Post that its approach “basically replaces an old analog function — your eyeballs. It’s the same thing as a guy holding his head out the window, looking down the block, and writing license-plate numbers down and comparing them against a list.”</p>

<p>A 2015 press release from Vigilant bragged that law enforcement will have access to more than 3 billion historical license plate scans from the company, with 100,000 new ones coming every month. That means it would be 6 billion plus, if they haven’t erased any since.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, the last of those three technologies means cameras can shoot you walking down the street and determine who you are by the contours of your face.</p>

<p>“This scares the hell out of me,” he said. “It hearkens back to ‘Minority Report.’”</p>

<p>Pezold is referring to the Tom Cruise movie in which “pre-cogs” predict crimes before they are committed.</p>

<p>It’s not outlandish. There’s the emerging field of “predictive policing,” which the National Institute of Justice says is “harness(ing) the power of information, geospatial technologies and evidence-based intervention models to reduce crime.”</p>

<p>Worried the government might create a storehouse of where we go, Pezold pushed a bill to limit holding such info for 30 days. After lots of pushback from police and other security agencies, Pezold relented and passed a bill that such information must be erased in 30 months.</p>

<p>ATLANTA - “The recently released December 2017 video of the violent arrest of Desmond Marrow by Henry County law enforcement is extremely disturbing," stated Andrea Young, Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia.

<p>By Lisa Hagen | 90.1 FM WABE | April 12, 2018</p>

<p>The ACLU of Georgia is continuing to caution government officials against censoring comments on their social media networks. The group sent its latest warning to Republican State Sen. John Albers after nine Georgians complained they were blocked from posting on his Facebook page.</p>

<p>In recent months, the civil liberties group has also notified nearly a dozen local law enforcement agencies and politicians, including U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson and Rep. John Lewis, of similar first amendment concerns.</p>

<p>“When a government official creates a Facebook or Twitter page and opens it up for members of the public to comment on, they can’t then go and discriminate against certain people because of viewpoints that they may have,” said Sean Young, legal director at the ACLU of Georgia.</p>

<p>“You can’t have an open town hall and say ‘ok as soon as someone starts talking and getting emotional or saying mean things about me, then we’re going to take your mic away,” Young said.</p>

<p>As of Wednesday, when the ACLU sent its warning, Sen. Albers has changed the banner on his Facebook page. A picture of his family is now displayed in place of what was previously an image that included his official title and district.</p>

<p>An informational panel that used to describe his profession as “Senator at State of Georgia” now reads “This is my personal page. For news &amp; information visit: senatoralbers.com or legis.ga.gov. Thanks.”</p>

<p>“We appreciate the initial steps Senator Albers appears to have taken to separate any government page from his personal page. We hope that Senator Albers, as well as all elected officials, will continue to provide a forum where constituents can make their voices heard,” Young said upon seeing the changes.</p>

<p>A statement from Albers’ Senate office read in part, “Unfortunately social media has devolved in many ways and everyone should remember 13 year olds have access. Sadly and based on unfortunate negative behavior I do not use social media for official communication.”</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/news/aclu-sues-glynn-county-officials-over-cash-bail </p>

<p>By Wes Woolf | The Brunswick Times | March 10, 2018</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit Friday morning accusing Glynn County, Sheriff Neal Jump, Magistrate Judge Alex Atwood and attorney Reid Zeh for the parts they play in what the group alleges is “an unconstitutional cash bail system that discriminates against people who are financially strapped.”</p>

<p>The class-action lawsuit is brought on behalf of Margery Mock and Scott Ogden — both of whom were in the Glynn County Detention Center after arrests for criminal trespassing Wednesday — and other people detained in Glynn County for misdemeanor offenses because they cannot come up with the money to bond out of jail.</p>

<p>At 5 p.m. Friday, ACLU of Georgia Legal Director Sean Young announced Mock and Ogden are to be released.</p>

<p>Click here or the image to view and download the pdf.</p>

<p>“We have just learned that a court has ordered our clients’ release, though we still await news of actual release from our clients,” Young said in a statement. “And we will continue to push forward with this class action. Every single day, Glynn County throws people like Ms. Mock into jail simply because they cannot afford the predetermined cash bail required.</p>

<p>“We are moving forward with this case to ensure equal justice for all.”</p>

<p>Mock was jailed under a $1,256 bond and Ogden faced the same amount. The complaint lays out the process.</p>

<p>“A person arrested in Glynn County who can afford to pay the predetermined monetary amount is immediately eligible for release from jail upon payment (except those facing Family Violence Act charges),” according to the complaint. “Those arrestees who cannot afford their release may remain in jail for weeks, even months, without being afforded any hearing to meaningfully argue for their release.</p>

<p>“Moreover, persons accused of misdemeanors who cannot afford to pay bail or hire a private attorney are deprived of the opportunity to request an adversarial preliminary hearing to seek their release, either by challenging probable cause for their arrest or requesting lower bail. They are further denied the ability to bring subsequent motions or habeas petitions to modify or reduce bail through counsel.</p>

<p>Click here or the image to read or download the pdf.</p>

<p>“In fact, the only process available in Glynn County for misdemeanor arrestees who cannot afford their monetary bail or to hire private counsel is a hearing to enter a guilty plea and face sentencing.”</p>

<p>The complaint then points to Zeh, who serves as the state court public defender. State court usually handles cases that involve misdemeanors only.</p>

<p>“None of these plaintiffs can afford to hire a criminal defense attorney,” according to the complaint. “They are therefore eligible for representation only be defendant Zeh as a public defender. However, plaintiffs have never met with Zeh, who has a policy of not visiting public defense clients in the detention center, representing clients at their bail-setting hearing or requesting a preliminary hearing or bail-modification hearing on their behalf.”</p>

<p>A message left for Zeh was not returned as of press time. Jump did not return a phone call Friday.</p>

<p>Atwood said the processes for setting bail were already in place when he took the bench in 2017. As a state legislator, lawyer and judge, he said has always striven to follow the constitution and due process.</p>

<p>In all, the county, Atwood and Jump are alleged, by administering the cash bond procedure, to have violated the 14th Amendment regarding equal protection and due process, and the county and Zeh are accused of violating indigent misdemeanor arrestees’ 6th Amendment right to counsel and equal protection through counsel.</p>

<p>James Yancey is representing the plaintiffs in U.S. District Court in Brunswick, along with Young, Kosha Tucker, Andrea Woods, Twyla Carter and Brandon Buskey. Yancey filed the class certification motion Friday, along with a temporary restraining order motion and motion for preliminary injunction on behalf of similarly situated detained defendants who face only misdemeanor charges and cannot afford to bond out.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/aclu-georgia-files-amicus-brief-urging-federal-appeals-court-take-stand-against </p>

<p>ATLANTA - The ACLU of Georgia, represented by Alston &amp; Bird LLP, filed an amicus brief yesterday with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Jackson v. McCurry, a case that asks whether school administrators can preemptively ban a parent from speaking at a public school board meeting simply because the parent has threatened litigation against the school. The district court ruled that the school could do so, but the ACLU of Georgia is urging the appeals court to reverse that flawed ruling.</p>

<p>In its brief, the ACLU of Georgia argued that it is "a violation of the First Amendment for the government to preemptively and completely ban a concerned citizen from speaking at a limited public forum dedicated to hearing citizen complaints solely because he or she threatened to sue the government." The brief also noted that the school district's censorship policy of requiring anyone wishing to speak at a public school board meeting to submit their comments beforehand for government approval is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Plaintiff Richard Jackson was allegedly banned from speaking at an upcoming public school board meeting by the Chattahoochee County School District because he threatened to file a lawsuit against the school over the school's search of his daughter's cell phone. The district court dismissed his First Amendment claim.</p>

<p>"Every Georgian enjoys the constitutional freedoms that the First Amendment's free speech clause guarantees," stated Sean J. Young, Legal Director of the ACLU of Georgia. "Under the flawed reasoning of the district court, any government entity can censor or discriminate against anyone who dares to threaten litigation against the government. This is anathema to the First Amendment."</p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court's 1976 decision established that viewpoint discrimination is absolute because "[t]o permit one side of a debatable public question to have a monopoly in expressing its views to the government is the antithesis of constitutional guarantees."

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/aclu-georgia-sends-open-letter-school-superintendents </p>

<p>ATLANTA - Today, the ACLU of Georgia is releasing an open letter to administrators asking them to use the student walkout as a teaching moment and to lead their students in civic participation in our state.</p>

<p>"As we continue the fight to live out the true meaning of our Constitution, we should never forget the critical role that young people have always played as leaders in that fight," stated Andrea Young, Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia. "We must also remember the responsibilities that those of us who are beneficiaries of past battles now have in teaching our young leaders."</p>

<p>Young's letter includes several ways administrators and educators can use the walkout as a teaching moment.</p>

<pre><code>•   Allow students to attend demonstrations. School absentee policies in Georgia allow for occasional absences and excused absences for religious education, doctors' appointments and even educational family events. Attending a demonstration for part of a school day should be treated equally. Absence policies should not be used to punish students who are engaged in the educational experience of participatory democracy -- especially when the engagement is all about the need to ensure that they can pursue their education in a safe environment.

•   Give clear guidance on expectations. Ensure that students know what is expected of them and what they can do to voice their opinion. Students should be allowed to peacefully demonstrate, distribute literature and wear any insignia of their protest, such as shirts. Schools may regulate this speech to prevent disruption of education, but keep in mind that this sort of discussion is education and the students' ability to express their political viewpoints must be respected.

•   Foster healthy debate. In today's world, too often we are insulated from opposing viewpoints. This is a great opportunity to foster debate in an accepting environment. I urge you to use this opportunity as a teachable moment. You may want to consider setting aside time for assemblies or other events to consider the urgent issues of school safety that students across the country are now focused on. Teach your students what it means to peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights and to argue persuasively, which requires truly understanding opposing views and remaining respectful. And, of course, equally respect students who do not want to join demonstrations or who wish to oppose the most popular views.

<h2 id="theacluofgeorgiaurgesthestatebuildingauthoritytoendgovernmentcensorshipoflibertyplaza">The ACLU of Georgia Urges the State Building Authority to End Government Censorship of Liberty Plaza</h2>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/aclu-georgia-urges-state-building-authority-end-government-censorship-liberty-plaza </p>

<p>ATLANTA -- Today, the ACLU of Georgia sent a letter to the governor, his chief of staff, and the Georgia Building Authority (GBA) to urge an immediate end to government censorship of Liberty Plaza. Currently the GBA guidelines forbid organized protests at Liberty Plaza on weekends and evenings without the express approval of one of eight politicians who hold statewide office. What that means is those eight politicians alone hold in their hands the power to censor messages and dissent with which they disagree.</p>

<p>Although the Governor tweeted his apparent approval of the March for Our Lives Rally at Liberty Plaza on March 24th, neither students nor anyone should have to obtain the blessing of the governor to before they can exercise their First Amendment Rights.</p>

<p>"I feel that our difficulty with obtaining the permit for Liberty Plaza has opened my eyes on the extent to which the state's leaders actively discourage us from exercising our sacred constitutional rights," stated Elias Green, one of the high school student organizers of the March for Our Lives Atlanta. "Governor Deal, as the person holding the highest public office in Georgia, we are asking you to support to allow Georgians easy access to use the public spaces that they pay for. While safety is a priority, freedom should also be priority."</p>

<p>The eight "constitutional officers" are Governor, Lt. Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, State School Superintendent, Commissioner of Insurance, Commissioner of Agriculture, and Commissioner of Labor.</p>

<p>"Politicians have been slowly eroding the people's First Amendment rights around the State Capitol Building for years, pushing them away so that elected officials literally cannot see or hear their voices. This is an affront to our democracy," stated Sean J. Young, Legal Director of the ACLU of Georgia.</p>

<p>Stacey Abrams’s concerns about Georgia’s costly reliance on money bail is aligned with a bipartisan national effort to end the practice as it currently exists. Keeping people in jail because they are too poor to post money bond is deeply out of step with American principles. Gov.

We urge all of the candidates for governor to commit to continue this important work to bring equity and fairness to Georgia’s justice system.</p>

<p>Bail system discriminates against 'financially strapped' people, group says</p>

<p>The federal class action lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court in Brunswick, accuses the county of violating the due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, people charged with misdemeanor crimes who cannot afford to pay the bail are jailed indefinitely without the opportunity to "meaningfully argue for their release."</p>

<p>The suit includes a motion for class certification and a second motion seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to block authorities from keeping low-income arrestees in jail.</p>

<p>Sean Young, legal director for the ACLU of Georgia, said the Glynn County court system "holds hostage the freedom" of low-income individuals who cannot afford to pay the "ransom" needed for their release.</p>

<p>The suit argues that the county has for years required defendants to pay their bail amounts upfront. It goes on to say that bail amounts are set at a fixed rate, based only on the defendant's charge.</p>

<p>While those who can afford to pay for bail are immediately eligible for release, those who cannot "may remain in jail for weeks, even months," according to a copy of the complaint.</p>

<p>The complaint cites the examples of Margery Mock and Eric "Scotty" Ogden, who were arrested Wednesday on trespass charges. Their bails were set at $1,256 before they went before a judge.</p>

<p>Those who can't afford to hire attorneys are instead represented by B. Reid Zeh III. The complaint states that Zeh, a contract attorney hired by the county, has a history of not advocating for clients.</p>

<p>Zeh is named in the lawsuit, along with Glynn County Sheriff E. Neal Jump and Chief Magistrate Judge Alex Atwood. The suits argues that all three play a role in denying people's constitutional rights.</p>

<p>Andrea Woods, an attorney with the ACLU's Criminal Law Reform Project, said for lack of better options, poor people can either plead guilty or wait in limbo for their cases to move forward.</p>

<p>"A person's wealth should never decide their freedom, but that's exactly what's happening in Georgia and across the country," she said.</p>

<p>By Rhonda Cook | Atlanta Journal-Constitution | March 9, 2018</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a federal lawsuit accusing a Glynn County judge, sheriff and public defender of violating the rights of poor defendants by locking them up without any regard for their ability to post bond.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Brunswick, is the latest attempt to address what critics call a “two-tier system” for relatively minor offenses — such as loitering, drinking in public, misdemeanor traffic crimes, and the like. Critics say defendants with money for bail can avoid jail or get out quickly, while those who are broke remain behind bars.</p>

<p>Pre-set bail schedules have been a topic of litigation elsewhere in Georgia. Atlanta recently adopted a new ordinance designed to abolish bail for low-level offenders in Municipal Court. And pre-set bond is the final chapter in Gov. Nathan Deal’s criminal justice reform in legislation pending before the Legislature.</p>

<p>“People who cannot afford to pay bail or hire a private attorney face an impossible choice: plead guilty, or face loss of their families, jobs and homes as they wait for their cases to move through the system,” said Andrea Woods, an Equal Justice Works Fellowship attorney with the ACLU’s Criminal Law Reform Project.</p>

<p>“A person’s wealth should never decide their freedom, but that’s exactly what’s happening in Georgia and across the country,” Woods said. “In Glynn County, the contract public defender and prosecutors alike refuse to grant people the presumption of innocence and ignore the government’s due process obligation to ensure that release upon arrest is the norm.”</p>

<p>Glynn County Chief Magistrate Judge Alex Atwood said he was surprised by the lawsuit. “I haven’t received any communication from the ACLU expressing any concerns as they delineated in the complaint,” Atwood said. “I pride myself on being dedicated to the Constitution. I always have and I always will. I try to respect the due process rights of everyone.”</p>

<p>Atwood said the bail system was in place when he was elected to office in 2017.</p>

<p>Glynn County Sheriff E. Neal Jump said, “I don’t have a comment on it yet,” explaining that he had not read all of the complaint.</p>

<p>The lawsuit contends the three officials violated indigent defendants’ their constitutional right to be free from illegal searches and seizures.</p>

<p>It asks that the federal court allow the complaint to apply to all poor people who come before the Magistrate Court in Glynn County and not just the two people who filed the suit. The court document said investigators found that in just three months, at least 122 people were held in jail while their misdemeanor charges were pending.</p>

<p>Those 122 people included Margery Freida Mock and Eric Scott Ogden, who were arrested Wednesday on a misdemeanor charge of criminal trespass while trying to visit Ogden’s grandmother at a local motel.</p>

<p>They remained in jail Friday. Both are homeless and are being held on bonds of $1,256 that were automatically set.</p>

<p>Sean J. Young, legal director of the ACLU of Georgia, said there is a hearing set for Thursday in federal court in Brunswick on a request to have the two released from jail and to temporarily stop the Glynn County court from ordering anyone else held only because they cannot post bond.</p>

<p>According to the lawsuit, defendants can be held in jail for days or even weeks before seeing a judge.</p>

<p>The lawsuit complains that at a first appearance in court, Atwood simply reads defendants their rights and confirms the bail amount, and occasionally asks about their ability to pay. Defendants don’t necessarily have attorneys for those hearings.</p>

<p>The next time they go before a judge is for a weekly hearing called “jail pleas” in State Court.</p>

<p>“Accused persons are informed of their right to trial by judge or jury and of their right to counsel, and are encouraged to plead guilty and proceed without counsel in order to ‘take care of things quickly,’ or ‘get back to work,’” the lawsuit states. “Arrestees typically also receive the advisement that ‘most people proceed without a lawyer,’ and that to do so ‘is just easier.’ Accordingly, many accused persons plead guilty at their arraignment — likely because this is the only way they will have an opportunity to speak to a judge.”</p>

<p>The sheriff is complicit, the lawsuit argues, because he automatically holds people who cannot pay to get out.</p>

<p>And the lawsuit says Zeh, the public defender, does little to protect his indigent clients. Zeh “does not visit indigent clients in the detention center, or file motions to reduce bail or habeas petitions on their behalf.”</p>

<p>Young, the ACLU of Georgia legal director, said Glynn County courts hold poor defendants “hostage” to a “pre-determined ransom.”</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/aclu-sues-georgia-county-over-discriminatory-cash-bail-system-0 </p>

<p>BRUNSWICK, Ga. -- The ACLU of Georgia and the American Civil Liberties Union have filed a federal class action lawsuit against Glynn County, Glynn County Sheriff E. Neal Jump, Glynn County Chief Magistrate Judge Alex Atwood, and B. Reid Zeh, III, seeking an immediate and permanent change to an unconstitutional cash bail system that discriminates against people who are financially strapped.</p>

<p>As the lawsuit explains, people accused of misdemeanor crimes in Glynn County are treated differently based on the amount of money they have, which violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>The county, along with Sheriff Jump and Judge Atwood, has set predetermined amounts of cash bail for each misdemeanor offense, a practice that violates nearly 40 years of U.S. Supreme Court precedent. In Bearden v. Georgia (1983), the Supreme Court stated that people cannot be jailed simply for being poor. The high court wrote, "Over a quarter-century ago, Justice Black declared that '[t]here can be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has.'"</p>

<p>"The Glynn County court system holds hostage the freedom of individuals arrested for misdemeanors," stated Sean J. Young, Legal Director of the ACLU of Georgia, "leaving those who are financially strapped unable to afford the predetermined ransom."</p>

<p>For example, For example, plaintiff Margery Mock is incarcerated on a $1,256 bond on an alleged criminal trespassing charge from trying to visit a relative at a motel. Because she is unable to pay the cash bond, Ms. Mock remains in jail.</p>

<p>In addition, the lawsuit claims that those who are accused of misdemeanors and unable to hire a defense attorney are left to contend with Mr. Zeh, an attorney who contracts with Glynn County to represent them. However, as the suit alleges, Mr. Zeh has a practice of failing to visit detained clients or to represent them in bail proceedings. This is a violation of the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a meaningful defense.</p>

<p>"People who cannot afford to pay bail or hire a private attorney face an impossible choice: plead guilty, or face loss of their families, jobs, and homes as they wait for their cases to move through the system," said Andrea Woods, Equal Justice Works Fellowship Attorney with the ACLU's Criminal Law Reform Project. "A person's wealth should never decide their freedom, but that's exactly what's happening in Georgia and across the country. In Glynn County, the contract public defender and prosecutors alike refuse to grant people the presumption of innocence and ignore the government's due process obligation to ensure that release upon arrest is the norm."</p>

<p>The lawsuit filed today includes a complaint, a motion for class certification, and a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction.</p>

<p>The ACLU Campaign for Smart Justice - an unprecedented effort to reduce the U.S. jail and prison population by 50% and to combat racial disparities in the criminal justice system - has launched a new initiative focused on bolstering the movement to end money bail and eliminate wealth-based pretrial detention through legislative advocacy, voter education, and litigation. The lawsuit in Glynn County is the third related filing by the ACLU in 2018 alone, with many more to come in the effort to end our overreliance on the cash bail system.</p>

<p>By Vanessa McCray | The Atlanta Journal-Constitution | March 8, 2018</p>

<p>Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 28, 2018.</p>

<p>The Atlanta-based ACLU of Georgia sent its first letter demanding that a school district reconsider how it disciplined a student who walked out of school in protest of gun violence.</p>

<p>The organization on Wednesday sent a letter to the Liberty County School System in Hinesville, Ga., after a sophomore at Bradwell Institute received a five-day suspension for walking out of school in protest after the Feb.14 Florida school shooting that killed 17 people.</p>

<p>The organization’s advocacy on behalf of the student comes as students across the nation are protesting gun violence. Schools in metro Atlanta are preparing for massive student walkouts next week as part of a nationwide demonstration.</p>

<p>The state ACLU said the Liberty County student left the school during a break between classes and crossed the street to protest for 17 minutes. In response, the ACLU said she received a five-day out-of-school suspension for “student incivility-insubordination” which the legal organization contends is an unconstitutional and “wildly disproportionate” punishment because it is far longer than a one day in-school suspension that the student’s mother was told is the typical punishment for an unexcused absence.</p>

<p>The ACLU asked the school system to “immediately” allow the student to return to class this week and expunge the discipline from her student record.</p>

<p>“Alternatively, you should reduce her punishment to the equivalent punishment that any other student would receive for being absent from school without excuse for less than an hour, and if [she] has already served that punishment, she should be allowed to return to class immediately,” the letter stated. “We understand that school principals have an exceptionally difficult job, as you strive to ensure that all students are able to learn in a safe environment. But a five-day suspension for 17 minutes of peaceful protest is way out of line.”</p>

<p>“...[R]efusing to speak exactly in the way that government authorities want you to speak is not called ‘insubordination,’ it is called free expression, and it is protected by the First Amendment. Nothing obligated [the student] to meet with school administrators to discuss in advance how she should exercise her speech, and nothing obligated [her] to agree with how the school would have preferred that she exercise her speech,” the organization wrote.</p>

<p>The school district responded to a request for comment by providing a statement it also sent to the ACLU.</p>

<p>The statement said: “The Liberty County School District places a great deal of importance on the safety of its students and staff and is sympathetic and understanding to the concerns about the Parkland, Florida incident. The code of conduct clearly outlines consequences for classroom and or school disturbances. In reference to the student who protested the Parkland, Florida incident; the student was dealt with in accordance with the Liberty County School System Code of Conduct.”</p>

<p>A state ACLU spokeswoman said this is the first letter the organization has sent to a school district in response to a student walkout-related complaint.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/aclu-georgia-calls-out-barrow-county-sheriffs-department-rejecting-applications </p>

<p>ATLANTA -- The ACLU of Georgia sent another demand letter to the Barrow County Sheriff's Department concerning tomorrow's Islamophobic training titled "Islam in America" because the department "appear[s] to be unconstitutionally discriminating against [those] who may even attend this training, in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>

<p>Yesterday, nine concerned Georgia residents who follow the Muslim faith sought to register to attend this "training" to see for themselves what is being taught, but the Barrow County Sheriff rejected their applications. The Sheriff claimed that this event is open to houses of worship in Barrow County only.</p>

<p>Yet an e-mail exchange between the Sheriff's Office and the trainer, David Bores, produced in response to the ACLU of Georgia's Open Records Request, revealed that three people from the First Baptist Church in Atlanta were allowed to register for the "training."</p>

<p>"Anyway you cut it, the sheriff's exclusionary policy appears to be a backdoor ban on people of the Muslim faith," stated Sean J. Young, Legal Director of the ACLU of Georgia. "Blatant discrimination on the basis of religion violates the constitution and offends who we are as Americans. We urge the Sheriff to join the Georgia Association of the Chiefs of Police in rejecting this inflammatory and hateful training. Our brave men and women in uniform deserve better."</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/aclu-georgia-demands-liberty-county-school-system-cancel-immediately-suspension </p>

<p>ATLANTA - The ACLU of Georgia sent a letter to Bradwell Institute and the Liberty County School System demanding that they immediately cancel the suspension of Amari Ewing, a sophomore at Bradwell Institute, who received a wildly disproportionate five-day suspension for protesting the Parkland shooting by walking out of school. She remained out of class for 17 minutes - one for each person killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.</p>

<p>According to Keysha Ewing, the student's mother, when she asked Principal Gilbert what the typical punishment was for an unexcused absence, he told her that an unexcused absence results in only one day of in-school suspension.</p>

<p>"If this is true, then punishing Amari five times more severely for being absent for only 17 minutes is blatantly unconstitutional," wrote Sean J. Young, Legal Director for the ACLU of Georgia. "It is unconstitutional to punish a student who peacefully walks out in protest more severely than any other student who is absent from school for 17 minutes or some other short period of time without excuse, for whatever reason," Young continued.</p>

<p>The ACLU of Georgia is demanding Ms. Ewing return to school immediately and the principal and superintendent fully expunge this unconstitutional discipline from her record or reduce her punishment to the equivalent punishment that any other student would receive for an unexcused absence from school for less than an hour.</p>

<p>ATLANTA - The ACLU of Georgia thanks Frank Rotondo, Executive Director of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, for withdrawing his organization's approval of the Islamophobic training scheduled for Thursday, March 8, 2018, at the Barrow County Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>"Our brave law enforcement officers deserve the best and most credible training available," stated Andrea Young, Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia. "We are pleased that the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police agrees with us that training police officers to violate people's constitutional rights is wrong and will no longer approve of this inflammatory, hateful, and dangerous use of taxpayers' dollars."</p>

<p>As leaders of the law enforcement community, sheriffs and police chiefs should promote accurate and effective trainings for their staff, rather than those that promote unjust racial or religious profiling or offensive stereotypes. This program would teach law enforcement officers to treat Georgians differently based on their religion. Such prejudice contributes to an environment ripe for hate crimes and constitutional violations.</p>

<p>The sheriff's "training" may potentially violate the Constitution and is an affront to the professionalism of our brave men and women in uniform, the communities they have sworn to protect, and the taxpayers' dollars.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police withdrew its approval, the Barrow County Sheriff's Office has yet to cancel its Islamophobic training.</p>

<p>The ACLU of Georgia responds to an article in Sunday's Atlanta Journal-Constitution" PolitiFact: Abrams stretches point on poor jail inmates.</p>

<p>"Gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams' concerns about Georgia's costly reliance on money bail is aligned with a bipartisan national effort to end money bail as it currently exists. Keeping people in jail, because they are too poor to post a money bond is deeply out of step with American principles," stated Andrea Young, Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia.</p>

<p>"Governor Deal's four-year effort to reform Georgia's criminal justice system is addressing problems with the bail system in this legislative session. To quote the Georgia Council on Criminal Justice Reform, 'For those who cannot afford bail, the human costs can be significant. People held in jail pretrial often lose their jobs, leaving them unable to support their families and ultimately unable to meet their court-imposed financial obligations.'" Ms. Young continued.

<p>Atlanta Journal-Constitution | February 25, 2018</p>

<p>FILE - In this Feb. 12, 2018 file photo, Sen. Bruce Thompson, R - White, speaks about the the computer crime bill in Atlanta. Republican Attorney General Christopher Carr has backed a proposal that would ban "unauthorized computer access." The measure has passed the Senate and awaits action in the House. (Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP, File)</p>

<p>ATLANTA — Lying about your weight on an online dating site? Checking out who won the Falcons game from your work computer? Using your computer hacking knowledge as an "ethical hacker?" Those actions may become illegal if a Georgia bill gets voted into law, civil liberty advocates say.</p>

<p>Supporters of a bill making its way through the state legislature say it's designed to give law enforcement the ability to prosecute "online snoopers" — hackers who break into a computer system but don't disrupt or steal data. The legislation came in response to a recent data breach at a Georgia university in which unauthorized cybersecurity experts noticed the vulnerability of Georgia's voting records.</p>

<p>But opponents say the legislation is so sweeping it could allow prosecutors to go after people who violate their user agreements or use a work computer for personal reasons. They also argue the bill will criminalize the "gray hats" of the cybersecurity world who use their hacking talents to find network weaknesses so they can be fixed, even if they never received permission to probe.</p>

<p>"This bill is not intended in any way, shape or form to criminalize legitimate behavior," said Republican Attorney General Chris Carr, whose office helped craft the measure.</p>

<p>Carr said only three states — Georgia, Virginia and Alaska — have no law against online "snooping," in which a hacker neither disrupts nor steals data. To remedy this, the measure criminalizes "any person who accesses a computer or computer network with knowledge that such access is without authority." The bill does not apply to parents who monitor their children's computer use, as well as those who are conducting "legitimate business."</p>

<p>The bill is specifically meant to stop criminal hacking, Carr said. Lawmakers backing the bill, which passed the Senate on Feb. 12, point to the acts of two unauthorized cybersecurity experts who in 2016 and 2017 discovered that a server at Kennesaw State University had left Georgia's 6.7 million voter records dangerously exposed. The men reported the vulnerabilities, but Carr said they should never have been snooping in the first place.</p>

<p>"If the research is legitimate, why should you not require someone to get permission on the front-end?" Carr said, arguing that it's hard to know what a snooper's intentions are.</p>

<p>Carr said the bill was drafted with the help of business groups and after conversations with the University System of Georgia, which has not taken a position on it. Carr said he is open for more input, especially from academics concerned it could hurt their ability to conduct research.</p>

<p>Andy Green is an information security lecturer at KSU. Green said that by alerting people at KSU's Center for Election Systems, the men prevented the data from falling into the wrong hands. Criminalizing such acts will only deter "ethical hackers" and not stop malicious ones, Green argued.</p>

<p>Independent security research is the "backbone" of efforts to protect consumers' data, said Camille Fischer, a fellow at Electronic Frontier Foundation, an international digital rights nonprofit advocacy group opposing the measure. Software vulnerability experts can be too expensive for some businesses, so the work of unauthorized researchers — who may be trying to raise their professional profile — is vital for the "ecosystem" to survive, she said.</p>

<p>But the measure's lead sponsor, Sen. Bruce Thompson, R-White, said some hackers have unethical or illegal intentions.</p>

<p>"When you go out and discover that there's a problem, but you aren't going to freely give it — you're going to make a business of it — that's extortion," Thompson said.</p>

<p>Fischer said many other states have anti-snooping laws that are modeled after the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which can be more narrowly worded by focusing on what cybersecurity experts do with the unauthorized access or what their intent was.</p>

<p>Other opponents said the bill is worded in such a way that any time a user violates a website's terms-of-service agreement or an employer's web-use guidelines, the user could be prosecuted.</p>

<p>"We should not be giving businesses the authority to determine what is criminal and what is not," Sen. Jen Jordan, D-Atlanta, told The Associated Press in an interview. She says the bill should only apply to those who act "maliciously."</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia has called the proposal "draconian and unnecessary."</p>

<p>"Something as simple as fudging your age on social media could land you in jail," said Sean J. Young, Legal Director for the ACLU of Georgia.</p>

<p>Jessica Gabel Cino, a professor at the Georgia State University College of Law, said user-agreement violations, technically speaking, would go against the "letter of the law." But she doubted anyone would ever actually be charged for such innocuous acts, something Carr also called "absurd."</p>

<p>"Our district attorneys with their limited time and resources are not going to spend any time trying to prosecute a roommate using the Netflix password," Carr said.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/remarks-burrell-ellis-political-director-aclu-georgia-senate-bill-407-and-misdemeanor </p>

<p>At the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, February 22, 2018, Burrell Ellis, Political Director for the ACLU of Georgia, provided the following remarks on Senate Bill 407 and Misdemeanor Bail Reform.</p>

<p>Chairman Stone and members of the Judiciary committee, my name is Burrell Ellis and I'm the Political Director of the ACLU of Georgia.</p>

<p>Today, I'd like to talk about three Constitutional principles regarding Senate Bill 407 and misdemeanor bail reform.</p>

<p>First, the Presumption of Innocence is a fundamental principle of due process under the U.S. Constitution. We ask that there be a statement affirming this long-recognized principle of presumption of innocence in Part II of the bill.</p>

<p>Second, we ask that there be specific language affirming Presumption of Release for bailable offenses. The U.S. Supreme Court recognized long ago the fundamental right to pretrial liberty, except for carefully limited exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>Section 2-4 requires courts to impose "least restrictive conditions possible" and speaks against "excessive bail". As the least restrictive condition is release without cash bail, we propose that the bill state just that.</p>

<p>Third, we ask your consideration of the Purpose of Bail, which is to ensure appearance in court. We propose more use of citations in lieu of arrests, rather than arrest-by-citation, for low level nonviolent offenses.</p>

<p>Sections 2-2 and 2-3 are steps in the right direction, but fail to go far enough. Specific authority to issue citations in lieu of arrests</p>

<ul>
<li>promote safety by keeping officers on the street instead of spending hours transporting people to jail for petty violations, and</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, we oppose the proposed mandatory minimums contained in the bill, because these are not criminal justice reforms. They are more of the same failed policies that have filled our prisons, driven up taxpayer costs, and failed to keep us safer.</p>

<p>I stand here today as living, breathing evidence of why it matters to have the Constitution.</p>

<p>We are protected, without warning, against search, seizure, arrest, incarceration … or possibly worse.</p>

<p>I say that from my personal experience, because even here in America, I was subject to search and seizure without reasonable probable cause.</p>

<p>Even here in America, I was subject to censure without a conviction or criminal record.</p>

<p>Even here in America, I was incarcerated and taken away from my family after being denied a fair trial and an appeal bond.</p>

<p>But, because here in America we have a Constitution, I had a right to appeal. It is that Constitutional right that reversed the wrongful conviction and restored my freedom. And, so, we must recognize that even here in America, injustice can occur, because the system is imperfect.</p>

<p>As we move to becoming the more perfect union which we espouse, we must hold true to the principles embedded in the Constitution which are designed to ultimately protect us and ensure our freedom.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/prepared-remarks-andrea-young-executive-director-aclu-georgia-atlanta-city-council </p>

<p>My name is Andrea Young, and I am the executive director of the ACLU of Georgia. The ACLU of Georgia supports legislation to end the use of cash bail.</p>

<p>In his famous "Letter from the Birmingham Jail" Dr. King reminds us: "there are two types of laws: there are just laws, and there are unjust laws."</p>

<p>In our civil rights era, city leaders like Jesse Hill and Herman Russell used their homes as collateral to make bail for the student protesters who were fighting to dismantle Jim Crow segregation.</p>

<p>Students were organized by student leaders such as Julian Bond, Lonnie King, Carolyn Long Banks- the first black woman to serve on this Council.</p>

<p>Why- more than 50 years later- why do we still maintain that unjust system of bail?</p>

<p>Laws that result in punishment for people who have not been found guilty of a crime are unjust.</p>

<p>Our current bail system perpetuates racial injustice. In Atlanta, the median income for black households is around $25,000, while the median white household income is around $80,000.</p>

<p>Laws that allow the business owner to go free, but require the janitor to sit in jail are unjust.</p>

<p>These laws create one system of justice for the affluent and another for working people and the poor. These laws are unjust.</p>

<p>We can, and we must unravel all of the manifestations of the New Jim Crow.</p>

<p>ATLANTA – The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia is threatening legal action against two sheriffs, a police department, and one congressman demanding that they stop censoring their critics who post on official government Facebook pages.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/news/how-aclu-threat-could-change-how-georgia-pols-use-social-media </p>

<p>The group said it has warned the sheriffs of Habersham and Worth counties, the Henry County Police Department and the office of U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson to stop “censoring their critics” who post on official government Facebook pages.</p>

<p>Any court action would be closely watched across the state – and aides to high-profile politicians. Outgoing Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed’s penchant for blocking Twitter users has become a running joke, and Secretary of State Brian Kemp has been accused of deleting posts critical of him.</p>

<p>The ACLU sent letters to the four government officials with screenshots of posts that were removed or users who were blocked.</p>

<p>Among them were posts that urged Ferguson to hold more town hall meetings or criticized his votes, and a series of comments on Habersham’s page from members of a marijuana advocacy group assailing drug-related arrests.</p>

<p>The letter to Henry County’s police department highlighted an Open Records Act request that revealed authorities had blocked at least 220 people from posting on the Facebook page. The Worth County site, it said, removed a post critical of the sheriff.</p>

<p>Ferguson’s office responded in a letter saying some of the accounts were “inadvertently” blocked and that access has been restored. He said it was not his intention to “silence the voices of my constituents,” according to the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer.</p>

<p>Several of the law enforcement sites, meanwhile, pointed to written policies saying they reserved the right to remove posts that it deemed defamatory, vulgar or disruptive. It’s not immediately clear if they reversed their positions.</p>

<p>The civil rights group’s leaders say there’s fertile legal ground for a challenge. It cited a federal judge’s ruling in July that found a politician violated the First Amendment rights of a constituent she blocked from her Facebook page.</p>

<p>It may not be an idle threat. The ACLU of Maryland and ACLU of Maine are suing governors in each state over the practice. And the ACLU of Pennsylvania has pushed a local councilmember to stop deleting comments from critics.</p>

<p>In Arizona, U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar unblocked a woman on Facebook who filed a lawsuit claiming he violated her free speech rights. She mounted a lengthy protest against him that involved depositing literal blocks at his office.</p>

<p>And California Gov. Jerry Brown quit restricting people on social media after a free speech advocacy group released documents in September showing he blocked about 1,500 people from Facebook.</p>

<p>Sean Young, the ACLU of Georgia’s legal director, gave each office 30 days to “cease your unlawful practice” of censoring the comments or face legal action.</p>

<p>“Politicians need to catch up to the 21st Century,” he said, “and get with the program.”</p>

<p>By Greg Bluestein | Politically Georgia | </p>

<p>Atlanta Journal-Constitution | December 20, 2017</p>

<p>The specter of a lawsuit by a civil rights group has forced some politicians and government officials to address a prickly question: Can they block their critics on social media?</p>

<p>It was sparked this week by the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, which warned four government officials to stop “censoring their critics” by blocking access or deleting comments posted on their official Facebook pages.</p>

<p>The group targeted the sheriffs of Habersham and Worth counties, the Henry County Police Department and the office of U.S. Rep. Drew Ferguson. But any court action would be closely watched across the state and could have implications in the highest reaches of Georgia officialdom.</p>

<p>After all, a slew of state leaders use social media as a principle way to communicate with the masses — and are known to keep an itchy finger on the “block” button.</p>

<p>That includes outgoing Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, whose penchant for blocking Twitter users has become a running joke in political circles. And Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, a Republican candidate for governor, has come under fire for deleting posts critical of him.</p>

<p>The ACLU’s letters to each government official includes images of posts that were removed or screen shots of users who were blocked from accessing their pages. Sean Young, the ACLU of Georgia’s legal director, gave each 30 days to restore “those who have been unlawfully blocked” or face a lawsuit.</p>

<p>“Georgia politicians need to be on notice that if they have an official government page, they can’t censor comments they don’t like,” Young said. “They should be encouraging more speech and not less. Because speech is central to our democracy, and we shouldn’t be discouraging comments critical of our government.”</p>

<p>He added: “Politicians need to catch up to the 21st century and get with the program.”</p>

<p>‘It will get worse’</p>

<p>Among the posts the ACLU targeted were comments that urged Ferguson to hold more town hall meetings or panned his votes in Congress, plus a series of comments on the Habersham page from members of a marijuana advocacy group criticizing drug-related arrests as a waste of taxpayer spending.</p>

<p>The letter to Henry County’s Police Department cited a recent Open Records Act request that revealed authorities had blocked at least 220 people from posting on the Facebook page. The Worth County site, the ACLU said, removed a post critical of the sheriff.</p>

<p>Ferguson’s office responded in a letter saying some accounts that were “inadvertently” blocked have been restored. He said it was not his intention to “silence the voices of my constituents,” and his office said his social media policy follows U.S. House rules and recent court rulings.</p>

<p>Several of the law enforcement departments declined to comment or did not directly address the legal threat, and it’s not immediately clear whether they all reversed their positions. Habersham County Sheriff Joey Terrell wrote on Facebook that he would “make some changes” to the account and expressed frustration about the legal threat in an email.</p>

<p>“Just shows where our country has gone,” he said, “and I’m afraid it will get worse.”</p>

<p>Fertile legal ground?</p>

<p>The ACLU’s attorneys cited a recent court order it said buoyed its position. That July ruling by a federal judge in Virginia concluded that a local politician committed a “cardinal sin under the First Amendment” by blocking a constituent on social media.</p>

<p>That’s provided more fuel for a volley of legal challenges. The ACLU of Maryland and ACLU of Maine are suing governors in each state over the practice. And the ACLU of Pennsylvania has pushed a local council member to stop deleting comments from critics.</p>

<p>Some politicians have taken pre-emptive action. In Arizona, U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar unblocked a woman on Facebook who filed a lawsuit claiming he violated her free speech rights. She mounted a lengthy protest against him that involved depositing real blocks at his office.</p>

<p>And California Gov. Jerry Brown quit restricting people on social media after a free speech advocacy group released documents in September showing he blocked about 1,500 people from Facebook.</p>

<p>The most-watched case, however, involves the White House. President Donald Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users blocked by him who say they were unlawfully restricted access to a public forum. The Justice Department warned a defeat could reshape First Amendment law and threaten how officials use social media.</p>

<p>‘No trolls’ </p>

<p>In Georgia, several leading politicians have faced similar scrutiny of their social media accounts.</p>

<p>Gov. Nathan Deal’s office said about 150 accounts, largely deemed to be bots or spammers, were banned from accessing his Facebook page earlier this decade.</p>

<p>None have been blocked since October 2014, when Deal’s account was converted to a “fan page,” said his spokeswoman, Jen Talaber Ryan. Seven accounts have been blocked from his Twitter page, and all were deemed to be bots or spammers, she said.</p>

<p>“As a rule, Facebook followers are free to comment and post on the governor’s page unless it’s hateful or degrading language,” Ryan said.</p>

<p>Reed has built a Twitter following of more than 414,000 users — more than any other U.S. mayor, he often says, except for New York’s Bill de Blasio. He’s also aggressively blocked detractors on Twitter, including journalists, political analysts and others who have lobbed critiques about him.</p>

<p>His office said he uses the account as a “personal platform” and not an official one, though the distinction can be fuzzy: The @MayorKasimReed account has had no updates in more than six years while the mayor posts on the @KasimReed account several times a day.</p>

<p>“Like all Twitter users, Mayor Reed has the right to stop engaging in conversations when he determines they are unproductive, intentionally inflammatory, dishonest or misleading,” a Reed aide said.</p>

<p>Others take a different tack. Kemp is one of five top Republican candidates in the race to succeed Deal, and he often peppers his posts with incendiary comments aimed at revving up his conservative base, including recent critiques of “Hollywood liberals” taking aim at his campaign and “hyper-partisan politicians” in Washington blocking Trump’s agenda.</p>

<p>A spokesman said he makes no apologies for restricting “left-wing radicals” who target his social media feed.</p>

<p>“Hate-spewing trolls from around the country spend countless hours attacking Kemp, reciting debunked conspiracy theories and intimidating Georgia voters,” said the spokesman, Ryan Mahoney.</p>

<p>“It’s sad and these people are literally pathetic,” Mahoney said. “Our social media policy is simple: No foul language. No fake news. No trolls.”</p>

<p>Trump Administration Must Release on an Accelerated Timetable Documents Concerning its Travel Ban on People of the Muslim Faith</p>

<p>ATLANTA – Yesterday, a federal court in Georgia agreed with the ACLU of Georgia that the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Atlanta Field Office must turn over, on an accelerated timetable, documents concerning its handling of the one-the-ground implementation of President Trumps’ ban on international travelers who are of the Muslim faith. Nearly one year after the ACLU of Georgia filed a Freedom of Information Act request demanding the release of these documents, the Trump Administration has only turned over 42 pages out of 17,131 pages of potentially relevant documents.</p>

<p>“The federal court recognized the ACLU of Georgia's position. The Trump administration must now move to release quickly public documents that disclose how it is implementing a law that is a moral affront to our basic American principles,” stated Sean J. Young, Legal Director of the ACLU of Georgia. “As a public entity, the federal agency answers to the people. And we, the people, have a right to know how public officials are implementing policies that have caused and continue to cause so much disruption, uncertainty, and anguish for our friends, neighbors, co-workers, and employees.”</p>

<p>The ACLU of Georgia first sought this information through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted to the federal agency on February 2 of this year. Since the Trump Administration failed to substantively respond, the ACLU of Georgia sued. The legal action is one of a total of 13 FOIA lawsuits by ACLU state affiliates around the nation.</p>

<p>The ACLU of Georgia’s lawsuit seeks records related to the federal government agency’s implementation of President Trump’s ban on Muslim travelers at Atlanta’s Hartsfield International Airport, where travelers were detained. When the Trump Administration announced this ban, thousands of people gathered at the Atlanta airport in protest. The U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment specifically prohibits government policies that target people of a particular faith. Atlanta’s Hartsfield International Airport is the busiest airport in the world.</p>

<p>“Trump’s ban on travelers of the Muslim religion continues to have an especially harmful impact throughout Georgia, particularly here in Atlanta, where immigrants and refugees – who should have been welcomed with open arms – faced questioning and detention upon their arrival at Hartsfield airport,” said Andrea Young, Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia.</p>

<h2 id="acluofgeorgiajoinsnationwidecampaigntoendmoneybail">ACLU of Georgia Joins Nationwide Campaign to End Money Bail</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2017-12-10</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.acluga.org/en/press-releases/aclu-georgia-joins-nationwide-campaign-end-money-bail </p>

<p>The national ACLU Campaign for Smart Justice intends to end the policy of holding freedom hostage to for-profit bail companies </p>

<p>ATLANTA – The American Civil Liberties Union of Georgia joins the national ACLU Campaign for Smart Justice initiative to end the money bail system that is unfair to the majority of Georgia families. This initiative is a part of the national ACLU’s unprecedented, nationwide, multi-year campaign to reduce the U.S. jail and prison population by 50 percent and combat racial disparities within the criminal justice system.</p>

<p>Many states have already begun to address these issues with a smarter approach. For example, Kentucky releases without bail about 70% of people awaiting the resolution of their cases. According to a report published by the Administrative Office of the Courts, Kentucky Court of Justice, “89% of those make all their future court appearances and 92% are not re-arrested while they are on pretrial release. … [Kentucky] reduces jail costs in that jail space is saved for the convicted and not the accused.”1 </p>

<p>Although debtors’ prisons were outlawed in the 19th century, thousands of Georgians are jailed each year because they're unable to post cash bail.</p>

<p>It’s past time to end our nation’s current system of cash bail, because it neither improves public safety nor is it just.</p>

<p>“Freedom should never be compromised for corporate profits,” stated Andrea Young, Executive Director of the ACLU of Georgia. “Many families are unable to afford the profit-driven price of bail. Their loved ones remain locked up for weeks, months, and even years. While in jail, they can lose their families, jobs, and homes as they wait for their day in court. This is morally wrong.”</p>

<p>Insurance Corporations Post $2 billion in Annual Profits </p>

<p>The money bail system was originally designed to ensure that people returned to court as their case progressed. It has since transformed into a system where insurance companies target those least able to afford to pay bail, impacting poor and middle-class families alike.</p>

<p>According to a recent report by Color of Change and the ACLU Campaign for Smart Justice, a small number of insurance companies collect their cut of nearly all the bail bond premiums collected by bail agencies. Nine bail insurers each underwrite a billion dollars in bonds to cover the vast majority of the estimated $14 billion in bonds posted by for-profit bail each year, yielding about $2 billion in industry profits.</p>

<p>The ACLU Campaign for Smart Justice is expanding its bail reform efforts both federally and at the state level with this new initiative which not only protects recent reforms but also advocates for new or further reforms through an integrated campaign effort that includes targeted litigation, communications, and legislative advocacy. These efforts will include a ‘Bail Shark of the Month’ communications initiative to highlight the multinational insurance corporations driving the cash bail system that is hurting American families throughout the nation.</p>
