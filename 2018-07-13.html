<p>Trey Ben watches as his team competes in the World Series of Stickball during the Choctaw Indian Fair at Choctaw Central High School Wednesday, July 11, 2018.</p>
<p>CHOCTAW – You know game time is near when the drumbeats begin from either end of the stadium. It’s a steady cadence – boom! boom! boom! boom! – and then the teams begin to enter Warrior Stadium at Choctaw Central High School from either end zone, led by the drum corps.</p>
<p>All the athletes, some barefoot and some wearing sneakers, hold sticks, which many click together with the beat of the drums. As the teams, 50 players strong, begin to pass one another in single file, they click one another’s sticks instead of shaking hands.</p>
<p>It is a ceremony that has taken place for centuries, long before American athletes played football, baseball and basketball. Seconds after the ceremonial grand entrance, 30 players from each team remain on the field and the others head for the sidelines. A referee in the middle of the field throws up a small orange ball – and then, well, and then all hell breaks loose.</p>
<p>Welcome to the World Series of Stickball, played annually as part of the Choctaw Indian Fair, near Philadelphia. As the P.A. announcer tells the packed stadium: “Cheer loudly, this is no place for the bashful!”</p>
<p>Yes, and the field is no place for the timid, either. There is a 12-foot-tall, four-inch wide pole at either end. These are the goals. Players use their sticks, made of hickory with a woven cup at one end, to advance the small, orange ball down the field and somehow touch the goals. You should know each team protects its post as if it were their first-born child.</p>
<p>Of all sports, it is probably most like lacrosse, which is said to have evolved from stickball. It is similar to American football in that contact is allowed and collisions often occur. It is similar to basketball in that no protective equipment – other than an optional mouthpiece – is worn. It is similar to baseball in that there is a stick involved. It is similar to soccer in that using your hands to touch the ball is strictly forbidden. It is similar to most other sports in that hand-eye coordination is required to catch the ball with the sticks.</p>
<p>Pearl River huddles between quarters during the World Series of Stickball at the Choctaw Indian Fair in Choctaw Wednesday, July 11, 2018.</p>
<p>The World Series of Stickball is similar to the World Cup of soccer in that the players play with extreme passion. One huge difference: There is no fame or fortune at stake in stickball. There is no Major League. There are no million dollar, guaranteed contracts, certainly no signing bonuses.</p>
<p>Says Thomas Ben, the 47-year-old Commissioner of the World Series of Stickball, “There’s no money in it, not much publicity. It’s all about the love of the game and bragging rights.”</p>
<p>Ben, a former player himself, calls stickball “the granddaddy of all American sports. It’s our traditional game and we take a lot of pride in it. ”</p>
<p>The earliest written record of stickball dates back to the mid 17th century, although there is evidence the sport was played long before that. Native Americans from many different tribes played. The early “fields” were sometimes miles and miles long. You might have 100 – or even 1,000 – players involved at a time. The games sometimes lasted several days and were played to solve disputes between the respective tribes.</p>
<p>Better a game than a war, right?</p>
<p>This is not to say that major injuries – and even death – didn’t occur during the games.</p>
<p>Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today</p>
<p>Fans watch as teams compete during the Choctaw Indian Fair at Choctaw Central High School Wednesday, July 11, 2018</p>
<p>“Stickball has come a long way,” Ben, the commissioner, says. “It is a lot safer now. It can still be a bit brutal but it’s fun.”</p>
<p>The World Series involves Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes, mostly from Mississippi, but also from Oklahoma. There are divisions for youth, men, women and even for men and women over 35 years of age.</p>
<p>Fighting during the games is strictly forbidden. Using your stick as a weapon will get you thrown out of the game – and the entire tournament.</p>
<p>“The sport requires speed, endurance, agility, strength and most of all toughness,” Ben says.</p>
<p>Paramedics watch – and are on call – at one end of the field. Jeremy Pogue, one of the paramedics, says he has treated players for lacerations and broken bones, as well as pulled muscles and muscle strains in the past.</p>
<p>“No major injuries this year, knock on wood,” he says.</p>
<p>He should have knocked harder on the wood.</p>
<p>The writer witnessed two games, one for teens and another for men. Both were fiercely contested and low-scoring. The game for teens went into “sudden death” overtime, with 15-year-old Cohen Keats scoring the winning goal. Keats says he learned the game from his father, who learned it from his father. Stickball is clearly a game handed down from generation to generation.</p>
<p>“I love it. I just love it,” Keats said afterward. “I even like getting hit because it gets my adrenaline going. Sometimes, it even feels good to get hit.”</p>
<p>And sometimes it doesn’t.</p>

<p>Mario Chickaway, 28, gets help from paramedics after suffering a broken femur during the World Series of Stickball at the Choctaw Indian Fair in Choctaw Wednesday, July 11, 2018.</p>
<p>The second game, a men’s game featuring the two men’s teams that have won the 2016 and 2017 World Series championships, was delayed for 20 minutes while paramedics treated 28-year-old Mario Chickaway, who apparently suffered a broken femur (thigh bone), when he was tackled from behind after catching the ball with his sticks. Officials said the injury occurred on a “perfectly legal” hit.</p>
<p>After the ambulance departed the field, the team from the Pearl River community went on to defeat a Koni Hata community team 2-1 in the semifinal game and will play in the World Series championship game Saturday night.</p>
<p>For Wes Wallace, a 39-year-old Pearl River player from Edinburg, it was his fifth game in two weeks.</p>
<p>Some people play golf and some play tennis for hobbies. He plays stickball. When he is not playing stickball, he works as a construction manager. He is a Mississippi State graduate with a industrial technology degree who has been playing stickball for 20 years.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it can be pretty rough out there, but I just enjoy it,” he says. “It’s a great way to release energy.”</p>
<p>Perhaps. This writer will take his word for it.</p>

<p>Federal investigators are reopening the Emmett Till case, which started with the kidnapping and brutal murder of a black child in Mississippi in 1955.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reports that the U.S. Justice Department said it would take another look at the case, closed in 2007, in a report to Congress in March.</p>
<p>The report does not contain details about the new information, but did coincide with the publication of a book titled “The Blood of Emmett Till.</p>
<p>Till, who was 14 at the time of his death, was murdered while visiting relatives in from Chicago. During the visit, Till and his cousins visited a store in Money owned by Roy and Carolyn Bryant, who said that Till grabbed her her arm, put his hands on her waist and made sexually suggestive comments.</p>
<p>Bryant and his brother, J.W. Milam, later kidnapped Till from his relatives’ home. Days later, Till’s body was found. He had been been badly beaten and shot. A cotton gin fan had been tied around his neck with barbed wire before he was thrown in the Tallahatchie River.</p>
<p>An open-casket photo of Till published in Jet magazine helped galvanize the modern civil-rights era. Roy Bryant and Milam were acquitted of the murders, but later confessed in a magazine interview.</p>

<p>Wheeler Parker, Emmett Till’s cousin and eye-witness to the events that took place in 1955, stands next to the Emmett Till river marker during a rededication ceremony for the marker on River Road in Glendora Thursday, June 21, 2018. The previous marker was riddled with bullets in 2016.</p>
<p>In the new book on Till, Carolyn Bryant (now Donham) said she fabricated aspects of her testimony during her husband’s trial.</p>
<p>In June, Wheeler Parker, a cousin to Till and eye-witness to the events that took place in 1955, visited Mississippi for the rededication of a marker commemorating the case on the Tallahatchie River in Glendora. A previous marker was riddled with bullets in 2016.</p>

<p>File photos of John W. Milam, 35, left, his half-brother Roy Bryant, 24 , center, who go on trial in Sumner, Miss., Sept. 18, 1955, are charged with the murder of 14-year-old African American Emmett L. Till from Chicago, who is alleged to have “wolf-whistled” and made advances at Bryant’s wife Carolyn, seen right.</p>
<p>Editor’s note: The following is the testimony of Carolyn Bryant, given during the trial of her husband, Roy, and J.W. Milam, who were charged with the murder of Emmett Till in 1955. Carolyn Bryant testified then that Till, a teenager visiting the Delta from Chicago, came into her store, grabbed her wrist and waist and made lewd comments. She later told an author, in a book published this year, that parts of the account she gave in 1955 were untrue. In March, the Justice Department said it was reopening the case because new, but unspecified information in the case. The transcript was lightly edited for clarity; for the full trial transcript, go here.</p>
<p>MRS. ROY BRYANT,</p>
<p>A witness introduced for and on behalf of the defendants,</p>
<p>being first duly sworn, upon her oath testified as follows:</p>
<p>DIRECT EXAMINATION</p>
<p>BY MR. CARLTON (attorney for Bryant and Milam):</p>
<p>Q What is your name, please, ma’am?</p>
<p>A Mrs. Roy Bryant.</p>
<p>Q You are the wife of one of the defendants in this</p>
<p>case, the defendant Roy Bryant, is that right?</p>
<p>A Yes, Sir.</p>
<p>Q How old are you, Mrs. Bryant?</p>
<p>A Twenty one.</p>
<p>Q And how tall are you?</p>
<p>A Five feet, two inches.</p>
<p>Q How much do you weigh, Mrs. Bryant?</p>
<p>A One hundred and three pounds.</p>
<p>Q Do you have any children?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q What are those children’s names?</p>
<p>A Roy Bryant, Jr., and Thomas Lamar Bryant.</p>
<p>Q And they are both boys, I believe?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q What is Roy Jr’s age?</p>
<p>A He is three.</p>
<p>Q And how old is Thomas Lamar?</p>
<p>A Two.</p>
<p>Q How old is your husband, Mrs. Bryant?</p>
<p>A Twenty four.</p>
<p>Q When were you all married?</p>
<p>A April 25th, 1951.</p>
<p>Q Did Roy serve in the Armed Forces?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q When did he enlist in the Armed Forces?</p>
<ol>
<li>SMITH: We object, Your Honor. That is incompetent,</li>
</ol>
<p>immaterial and irrelevant.</p>
<p>THE COURT: The objection is overruled.</p>
<p>Q When did he enlist in the Armed Forces?</p>
<p>A In June of 1950.</p>
<p>Q That was about ten months, I believe, before you</p>
<p>married?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q How long did he stay in the service?</p>
<p>A Three years.</p>
<p>Q Did he get out in about June of 1953 then?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Now Mrs. Bryant, I direct your attention to Wednes-</p>
<p>day night, on the 24th day of August, on that evening, who</p>
<p>was in the store with you?</p>
<p>SMITH: If the Court please, we object to anything</p>
<p>that happened on Wednesday evening unless it is connected</p>
<p>BRELAND (attorney for Bryant and Milam): We will connect it.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Will the jury please retire to the jury</p>
<p>room.</p>
<p>(The jury retired to the jury room, and the proceed-</p>
<p>ings continued in the absence of the jury.)</p>
<p>CARLTON (attorney for Bryant and Milam): If the Court please, it is the</p>
<p>position of the defendants in this case that on the direct exam-</p>
<p>ination of Mose Wright by the State, the state showed that</p>
<p>one of the men who came to the home of Mose Wright on the</p>
<p>night of Wednesday, the 24th day of August, testified</p>
<p>that one of these men wanted to see the boy that did the</p>
<p>talking down at Money.</p>
<p>The State having introduced that testimony has</p>
<p>raised inferences which the defendants believe they are</p>
<p>entitled to explain and to show what happened.</p>
<p>And the State having opened the inquiry as to the</p>
<p>occurences on that occasion has given the defendants the</p>
<p>right to explain those occurences.</p>
<p>And further the defendants believe that these</p>
<p>occurences are a part of what the state alleges is one</p>
<p>entire transaction, the beginning and inception of the</p>
<p>incident. And as much, the occurances there on that</p>
<p>occasion are a part of the res gestae of the case. And</p>
<p>as such the defendants should be permitted to offer test-</p>
<p>imony in that particular.</p>
<p>SMITH (attorney for the state): If the Court please, I don’t know on what</p>
<p>statement Mr. Carlton bases his idea or his statement that</p>
<p>we opened the thing up for anything that happened on Wed-</p>
<p>nesday prior to that particular Sunday morning. Our proof</p>
<p>started with the occurance on Sunday morning at two o’clock</p>
<p>when two or more persons came to Mose Wright’s house for</p>
<p>the boy. And we went from there on with our evidence and</p>
<p>proof.</p>
<p>We have offered no proof whatsoever of anything</p>
<p>that happened prior to that time. And Mrs. Bryant has not</p>
<p>been brought into this thing whatsoever. And I think I am</p>
<p>safe in saying that her name has not even been mentioned</p>
<p>in this case.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court of Mississippi has many times</p>
<p>held that former difficulties where not a part of the res</p>
<p>gestae cannot be brought in as evidence. In other words,</p>
<p>in a series of occurances which might chronologically</p>
<p>follow one another in a short space of time, the Supreme</p>
<p>Court has ruled that those things are not competent if</p>
<p>they are not a part of the res gestae. And I am sure Your</p>
<p>Honor is familiar with that more than I am.</p>
<p>And there have been numerous cases of homicide</p>
<p>and assault, where parties would have some difficulty one</p>
<p>day and then the next day they might meet up and some other</p>
<p>trouble or altercation take place between them.</p>
<p>And we contend that anything whatsoever that</p>
<p>happened down there on Wednesday is no justification for</p>
<p>murder anyway. And we feel that _ wholly incompetent</p>
<p>and irrelevant in this case. Anything that happened prior</p>
<p>to those men going down to Mose Wrights’ house is certainly</p>
<p>not competent to bring in here.</p>
<p>BRELAND: If the Court please, I believe the prosecution has looked at</p>
<p>these things and the Supreme Court rulings in a different light than _.</p>
<p>And I would like to call the attention of the</p>
<p>Court to the fact that the Supreme Court has ruled that an</p>
<p>incident may be separated by days, and by weeks even, but</p>
<p>if they can be connected as part or partial of a man’s</p>
<p>transaction, then it doesn’t mean that these things must</p>
<p>all happen right together.</p>
<p>If any of the happenings can be connected up and</p>
<p>it forms a background for a later happening, then that can</p>
<p>be considered as part of an entire transaction. And I</p>
<p>believe the Supreme Court has ruled on that several times</p>
<p>in the past.</p>
<p>THE COURT: Gentlemen, as the Court understands our</p>
<p>Supreme Court decisions relating to such evidence, evidence</p>
<p>of prior difficulties may be introduced providing that it</p>
<p>can be considered a part of the res gestae, and particul-</p>
<p>arly where there has been any altercation, or a difference,</p>
<p>or an incident between parties, and the deceased is shown</p>
<p>to be the aggressor, or when there is any question of</p>
<p>doubt as to who might have been the aggressor, then such</p>
<p>evidence would be admissible. But without such a showing</p>
<p>it would not be admissible.</p>
<p>WHITTEN (attorney for Bryant and Milam): Excuse me, Your. Honor, but</p>
<p>I don’t think that is our strongest point in our argument. In the first</p>
<p>place, the State, by its own witness, has raised in the</p>
<p>minds of this jury some question as to whether what happened</p>
<p>down there at the store in Money was just mere talk.</p>
<p>But it was not only stated just-one time to the</p>
<p>jury, but is was repeated two other times, as I recall,</p>
<p>that the reason these men were down there was because they</p>
<p>wanted to see the boy that had done the talking down at</p>
<p>Money.</p>
<p>And we believe that where the State raises or</p>
<p>puts in evidence any testimony, even though it might be</p>
<p>immaterial to the issues, we say that the accused must</p>
<p>have an opportunity to explain it or develop it further</p>
<p>to show the jury all the facts.</p>
<p>THE COURT: The Court is of the opinion that any</p>
<p>accused in any criminal case can bring out anything re-</p>
<p>lating to a continuation of any part of an alleged crime.</p>
<p>But the testimony that is being offered here of details</p>
<p>of a prior incident, I do not believe that is admissable.</p>
<p>And the Court’s recollection of the testimony was</p>
<p>that Mose Wright testified that the defendant, J. W. Milam,</p>
<p>stated that he wanted the boy that did the talking over at</p>
<p>Money. And I believe there was another reference in the</p>
<p>testimony where they said something about the boy that did</p>
<p>the talking over at Money or down at the store in Money.</p>
<p>But the Court is of the opinion that evidence of the details</p>
<p>of what occured there at the store on that particular even-</p>
<p>ing is not permissable here.</p>
<p>BRELAND: And another thing, Your Honor, we contend</p>
<p>that whatever might be competent in evidence as to these</p>
<p>defendants is also competent with reference to their fam-</p>
<p>ilies, because they have the same right to protect their</p>
<p>families as they do themselves.</p>
<p>THE COURT: That would be perfectly true with reference</p>
<p>to the statement I made in the beginning relating to prior</p>
<p>incidents or conflicts between parties, and members of</p>
<p>their immediate families would also be included in that.</p>
<p>But that is admissable in evidence under our</p>
<p>Supreme Court decisions only where some question as to who</p>
<p>was the aggressor at the time the crime with which they</p>
<p>might be charged was committed, or that some overt act was</p>
<p>committed by the deceased at that time to make such evid-</p>
<p>ence of prior conflicts, or prior difficulties, or prior</p>
<p>relations between the parties, that can only be brought</p>
<p>out and shown when such a question arises. And then such</p>
<p>evidence where the immediate family is concerned would be</p>
<p>admissable in evidence.</p>
<p>BRELAND: We wish to develop the testimony for the</p>
<p>sake of the record, Your Honor.</p>
<p>THE COURT: That is the Court’s understanding under</p>
<p>the rules and laws of evidence of the State of Mississippi</p>
<p>in cases such as this. You may now proceed.</p>
<p>Q Mrs. Bryant, on Wednesday evening or Wednesday</p>
<p>night, the 24th day of August, 1955, did anyone — who was</p>
<p>in the store with you that night?</p>
<p>A No one.</p>
<p>Q You were alone in the store at the time?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Was there anyone in the living quarters at the rear</p>
<p>of the store?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Who was back there?</p>
<p>A Mrs. Milam and her two children and also our two</p>
<p>children.</p>
<p>Q Did any incident occur in that store on that evening</p>
<p>which made an impression on you?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And what time of the evening was that?</p>
<p>A About eight o’clock.</p>
<p>Q Was that before or after dark?</p>
<p>A After dark.</p>
<p>Q Just tell the Court what happened there at that</p>
<p>time, please, ma’am.</p>
<p>A This nigger man came in the store and he stopped</p>
<p>there at the candy case.</p>
<p>Q And in the store, where is the candy case located?</p>
<p>A At the front of the store.</p>
<p>Q And on which side is it?</p>
<p>A It is on the left side as you go in.</p>
<p>Q And that is the first counter there, is that right?</p>
<p>A Yes, Sir.</p>
<p>Q Now, is the store, with reference to that candy</p>
<p>counter, is there anything back of the candy counter towards</p>
<p>the wall of the store?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q Is there any place to walk there or anything of</p>
<p>that sort?</p>
<p>A Yes, an aisle.</p>
<p>Q When this negro man came in the store, where were</p>
<p>you in the store?</p>
<p>A I was farther back in the store, behind the</p>
<p>counter.</p>
<p>Q Where were you in the store when this man came in?</p>
<p>A I was farther back behind the counter.</p>
<p>Q Were you on the same side or on the other side?</p>
<p>A The same side.</p>
<p>Q And when he came in, I believe you said he stopped</p>
<p>in front of the candy counter, is that right?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And what did you do then?</p>
<p>A I walked up to the candy counter.</p>
<p>Q And what transpired up there at the candy counter?</p>
<p>A I asked him what he wanted.</p>
<p>Q And did he tell you?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Do you know what it was he asked for?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q And did you then get the merchandise for him?</p>
<p>A Yes. I got it and put it on top of the candy case.</p>
<p>Q And what did you do then?</p>
<p>A I held my hand out for his money.</p>
<p>Q Which hand did you hold out?</p>
<p>A My right hand.</p>
<p>Q Will you show the Court how you held your hand out?</p>
<p>A I held out my hand like this (demonstrating by</p>
<p>holding out her hand).</p>
<p>Q Which hand was that?</p>
<p>A My right hand.</p>
<p>Q And will you show the Court how you did that?</p>
<p>A Like this (demonstrating by holding out her hand).</p>
<p>Q And did he give you the money?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q What did he do?</p>
<p>A He caught my hand.</p>
<p>Q Will you show the Court just how he grasped your</p>
<p>hand?</p>
<p>A Like this (demonstrating with her hand).</p>
<p>Q By what you have shown us, he held your hand by</p>
<p>grasping all the fingers in the palm of his hand, is that</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And was that a strong grip or a light grip that he</p>
<p>had when he held your hand?</p>
<p>A A strong grip.</p>
<p>Q And will you show the Court what you did? How did</p>
<p>you get loose?</p>
<p>A Well, I just jerked it loose, like this (demonstrateing).</p>
<p>Q It was about that difficult to get loose, was it?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And it was with that much difficulty that you got</p>
<p>your hand loose?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Just what did he say when he grabbed your hand?</p>
<p>A He said, “How about a date, baby?”</p>
<p>Q When you freed yourself, what happened then?</p>
<p>A I turned around and started back to the back of</p>
<p>the store.</p>
<p>Q You did what?</p>
<p>A I turned to get to the back of the store.</p>
<p>Q Did you do anything further then?</p>
<p>A Yes. He came on down that way and he caught me at</p>
<p>the cash register.</p>
<p>Q You say he caught you?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q How did he catch you?</p>
<p>A Well, he put his left hand on my waist, and he put</p>
<p>his other hand over on the other side.</p>
<p>Q How were you going down along the counter there?</p>
<p>Did he approach you from the front, or from the rear or</p>
<p>how?</p>
<p>A From the side.</p>
<p>Q Now, Mrs. Bryant, will you stand up and put my</p>
<p>hands just where he grasped you? Will you show the Court</p>
<p>and jury?</p>
<p>A It was like this (demonstrating by putting Mr.</p>
<p>Carlton’s hands on her body).</p>
<p>Q He grabbed you like that, did he?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q In other words, with his left arm around your back?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And his left hand on your left hip?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And he had his right hand on your right hip?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Did he say anything to you then at the time he</p>
<p>grabbed you there by the cash register?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q What did he say?</p>
<p>A He said, “What’s the matter, baby? Can’t you take</p>
<p>it?</p>
<p>Q He said, “What’s the matter, baby? Can’t you take</p>
<p>it?”</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Did you then try to free yourself?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Was it difficult? Did you succeed in freeing your-</p>
<p>self?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Did he say anything further to you at that time?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q What did he say?</p>
<p>A He said, “You needn’t be afraid of me.”</p>
<p>Q And did he then use language that you don’t use?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Can you tell the Court just what that word begins</p>
<p>with, what letter it begins with?</p>
<p>A The witness did not answer verbally, but shook</p>
<p>her head negatively.)</p>
<p>Q In other words, it is an unprintable word?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Did he say anything after that one unprintable word?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And what was that?</p>
<p>A Well, he said — well — “With white women before.”</p>
<p>Q When you were able to free yourself from him, what</p>
<p>did you do then?</p>
<p>A Then this other nigger came in the store and got</p>
<p>him by the arm.</p>
<p>Q And what happened then?</p>
<p>A And then he told him to come on and let’s go.</p>
<p>Q Did he leave the store willingly or unwillingly?</p>
<p>A Unwillingly.</p>
<p>Q How did the other negro get out of the store then?</p>
<p>How did they leave?</p>
<p>A He had him by the arm and led him out.</p>
<p>Q Were there any white men in the store at the time</p>
<p>this occurred?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q Were there any other negro men in the store at the</p>
<p>time?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q Were there any other persons outside the store?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Were they white men or colored men?</p>
<p>A Colored.</p>
<p>Q Were there a number of them out there? How many of</p>
<p>them were out there?</p>
<p>A Oh, about eight or nine.</p>
<p>Q When he went out the door, did he say anything</p>
<p>further after he had made these obscene remarks?</p>
<p>A Yes. He turned around and said, “Good-by.”</p>
<p>Q And when he got out the door, what did you do?</p>
<p>A I called to Mrs. Milam to watch me and then I ran</p>
<p>out the door to go to the car.</p>
<p>Q Which car did you go to?</p>
<p>A Mrs. Milam’s.</p>
<p>Q What did you go to the car for?</p>
<p>A For my pistol.</p>
<p>Q Where was your pistol in the car?</p>
<p>A Under the seat.</p>
<p>Q It was under which seat?</p>
<p>A The driver’s seat.</p>
<p>Q As you went out the door and went to the car, did</p>
<p>you see this man again?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Where was he then? Where was he standing?</p>
<p>A He was standing by one of the posts on the front</p>
<p>porch.</p>
<p>Q Your store has a front porch to it?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And these posts are on the front porch?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Did he say or do anything at that time?</p>
<p>A He whistled and then came out in the road.</p>
<p>Q Can you give a sound something like the whistle</p>
<p>that he made there? Was it something like this? (Mr.</p>
<p>Carlton demonstrated by giving two low whistles.)</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q When you got your pistol, Mrs. Bryant, where was</p>
<p>this boy then? Or I should say where was this man?</p>
<p>A When I turned around, he was getting in a car down</p>
<p>the road.</p>
<p>Q Did you rush back in the store then?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Had you ever seen that man before?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q Have you ever seen him since?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q Tell us what size man he was. Describe about how</p>
<p>tall he was.</p>
<p>A He was about five feet, six inches tall.</p>
<p>Q And that is about four inches taller than you are,</p>
<p>is that right?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And how much would you say that he weighed?</p>
<p>A Around one hundred and fifty pounds.</p>
<p>Q Did he walk with any defect?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q Did he have any speech defect?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q Did you have any trouble understanding him?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q What sort of impression did this occurance make</p>
<p>on you?</p>
<p>A I was just scared to death.</p>
<p>Q Mrs. Bryant, do you generally know the negroes in</p>
<p>that community around Money?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q What kind of store is it that you run there?</p>
<p>A It is just a general store.</p>
<p>Q Are most of your customers negroes or white people?</p>
<p>A Most of them are negroes.</p>
<p>Q And of course, you come in contact with most of the</p>
<p>negroes around there in that way?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And you know most of them around there, do you?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q And was this man one of those?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q Did he talk with a southern or northern brogue?</p>
<p>A The northern brogue.</p>
<p>Q Did you have any difficulty understanding him?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q Did you have any white men anywhere around there</p>
<p>to protect you that night?</p>
<p>A No.</p>
<p>Q Was your husband out of town?</p>
<p>A Yes.</p>
<p>Q Do you know where he was?</p>
<p>A He was in Brownsville.</p>
<p>Q What was his purpose in being away from home then?</p>
<p>A He had carried a load of shrimp there.</p>
<p>Q Where had he started out with that load of shrimp?</p>
<p>A From New Orleans.</p>
<p>Q When did you expect him home?</p>
<p>A I didn’t know.</p>
<p>Q What was the reason for Mrs. Milam and the children</p>
<p>being there with you?</p>
<p>A So that I wouldn’t be alone.</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves denies any involvement in the decision to construct a $2 million frontage road from his subdivision to a traffic light to provide easier access to busy Lakeland Drive in Rankin County.</p>
<p>At a news conference at the Capitol Wednesday, where he accused members of the media of either being confused or of intentionally misrepresenting facts, Reeves said he would send a letter to Mississippi Department of Transportation executive director Melinda McGrath asking who in the Senate tried to influence the agency to construct the frontage road.</p>
<p>In an article earlier this week in the Clarion Ledger, McGrath said “political pressure” from the Senate led to the decision of MDOT to commit to constructing the frontage road.</p>
<p>“I am not aware of any undue influence on that particular project,” Reeves countered Wednesday to members of the media during a news conference in a Senate committee room.</p>
<p>MDOT</p>
<p>Reeves’ denial of his involvement was bolstered earlier Wednesday, when Central District Transportation Commissioner Dick Hall said at a news conference that he had not been in contact with any legislator nor with Reeves about the frontage road. Hall said he made the decision to construct the frontage road for safety reasons.</p>
<p>The frontage road would be located between two gated neighborhoods, consisting of fewer than 150 homes, to a red light at a shopping center to make it easier for the residents to turn left back toward Jackson. No other businesses or neighborhoods would benefit from the frontage road.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Hall announced he was postponing the project, which was set to be bid out for construction later this month. He said he wanted to re-assess whether the project is needed because of safety concerns. Plus, he acknowledged that media reports influenced his decision to postpone it.</p>
<p>“I don’t know of anything inappropriate,” Hall said. “If I was the lieutenant governor, I would have interest (in the project) and would have made my interest known. Nobody did anything illegal.”</p>
<p>The Clarion Ledger, in an editorial, also called for investigation into the matter although it remains unclear who would conduct such a probe. Any investigation launched by Jim Hood, who is the state’s top law enforcement official in his job as attorney general, could be seen as politically motivated.</p>
<p>Attorney General Jim Hood</p>
<p>Hood, who declined to comment on this story, and Reeves are expected to face off in next year’s governor’s race.</p>
<p>The head of the state ethics commission, Tom Hood, is Jim Hood’s brother. And for his agency to get involved with a case, he said: “(W)e’d need to prove that the person received some monetary benefit. That’s defined pretty broadly, but usually that has to be money in his bank account or something makes his property more valuable… and we’d have to prove it by clear and convincing evidence.”</p>
<p>The state auditor also investigates potential misspending of taxpayer funds, but a spokesman for that office said the auditor does not confirm or deny the existence of investigative matters.</p>
<p>State Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson, who serves on the state Senate Ethics Committee, said the committee only considers changes to state ethics laws. Sen. Chris Massey, R-Nesbit, who chairs the ethics committee, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.</p>
<p>Reeves acknowledged that he did lobby MDOT strongly for the completion of a widening project from four to six lanes of a section of Lakeland Drive near his home in Rankin County because of the fast growth in the area.</p>
<p>That project has been completed. He also conceded that the neighborhood association where he lives voiced their concerns about the intersection. The association apparently opposed a plan by MDOT engineers to construct a much cheaper U-turn for the residents of the neighborhoods to use to go left on Lakeland. MDOT engineers said placing a traffic light at the location was not a viable option because of the proximity of the neighborhoods’ intersection with Lakeland Drive to other traffic lights.</p>
<p>Emails the Clarion Ledger obtained indicate that some members of the lieutenant governor’s staff, whom the paper did not name, inquired about the frontage road issue. Reeves told reporters he knew little about the issue and did not engage with the neighborhood association in its communications with the Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>In his letter to McGrath, Reeves said, “If you have any unacceptable interaction with anyone in the Legislature on this or any other project that go outside the bounds of the body’s duty to be engaged in monitoring the department and holding it accountable, I need to know about it so I can investigate and take corrective steps if warranted.”</p>
<p>Reeves cited countless times where he or his staff had inquired about transportation projects or other projects on behalf of constituents. He said that is the constitutional duty of legislators who have the ultimate say on what projects are funded.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Mississippi Today also reported that since 2012 lawmakers have requested more than $163 million for special projects in their districts despite leaders’ pointed criticism of MDOT spending.</p>
<p>Reeves said it was appropriate for legislators to heed the advice of MDOT engineers on what projects to fund, but that legislators had the right to have the final say — if they chose to — through the passage of bills.</p>
<p>A spokesman for MDOT said McGrath is reviewing Reeves’ letter, but that she was not available to comment.</p>

<p class="source">url: <a href="https://mississippitoday.org/2018/07/10/lawmakers-requested-163m-for-pet-projects-even-as-they-criticized-mdot-spending/">https://mississippitoday.org/2018/07/10/lawmakers-requested-163m-for-pet-projects-even-as-they-criticized-mdot-spending/</a></p>
<p>Legislative leaders have requested more than $163 million for dozens of special transportation projects in their districts, a Mississippi Today analysis shows.</p>
<p>About half of those requests received funding, sometimes pushing other projects deemed necessary to enhance public safety lower on the list, records show.</p>
<p>A long standing practice in the Legislature, these earmark requests, made between 2012 and 2018, have continued while top lawmakers sharply criticized fiscal and operational management at the Mississippi Department of Transportation. Scrutiny over management of the agency has also resulted in attempts in recent years to strip the department of its spending authority.</p>
<p>These special requests from lawmakers are separate from the typical road-funding process, which includes allocations from MDOT’s roughly $1 billion annual budget, over which lawmakers have little legal control. Additionally, lawmakers include requests for specific projects in bond bills, but those projects are paid for with bond proceeds, not from MDOT’s regular budget.</p>
<p>When it comes to the special projects, MDOT’s internal evaluators deemed many of these projects unnecessary, records obtained through open-records requests show. In addition, fulfilling these requests often delayed other projects considered higher priority because of public safety considerations, department officials told Mississippi Today.</p>
<p>Among those projects, which came under scrutiny earlier this week, is a frontage road project that would connect a gated neighborhood where Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves lives in Rankin County to a nearby road with a traffic light.</p>
<p>County records show that state Sen. Josh Harkins, R-Flowood, also owns a house in the subdivision, but Harkins says that he no longer lives in the home. Reeves’ brother, Todd Reeves, also owns a home in an adjoining neighborhood, records show.</p>
<p>The $2 million frontage-road project – first reported Monday by Geoff Pender of The Clarion-Ledger – would draw state and federal funds, completing 2014 and 2015 special legislative requests to widen state Highway 25/Lakeland Drive.</p>
<p>MDOT</p>
<p>Melinda McGrath, executive director, Mississippi Department of Transportation</p>
<p>Melinda McGrath, executive director of MDOT, was traveling out of state Tuesday and unavailable for an interview. However, she told the Clarion-Ledger on Monday that her agency was “under pressure … from the Senate side” of the Legislature to construct the road to Reeves’ neighborhood.</p>
<p>Laura Hipp, a spokeswoman for Reeves, declined to make Reeves available for an interview about the frontage road, but told the Clarion-Ledger the city of Flowood consulted with MDOT to plan the project. She said special-project requests grew out of lawmakers’ frustration with how MDOT prioritizes projects in the state.</p>
<p>“When you have community leaders back home telling senators they can’t get their road needs addressed or that the agency isn’t listening, you’re going to have members of the Legislature make those local requests a priority for MDOT through the appropriations process,” Hipp said in a statement to Mississippi Today.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, legislators have a constitutional responsibility to spend the people’s money. The Legislature directing agencies on how to allocate their appropriation isn’t new.”</p>
<p>Nathan Wells, Gunn’s chief-of-staff, said the speaker leaves vetting projects to his committee chairmen rather than getting into the weeds of each one.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t think it’s necessarily wrong for the Legislature to say, ‘These projects are important to focus on.’ It’s part of the process of appropriations. I think by and large, the vast majority of projects are valid and good projects, even if they aren’t on MDOT’s priority list,” Wells told Mississippi Today.</p>
<p>Mississippi Today compiled a list of all 50 legislative project requests made since 2012 and asked MDOT whether the requested project was deemed necessary, whether the lawmakers’ request was granted, how much the project would cost and whether granting the request would delay higher priority safety projects.</p>
<p>Since 2012, MDOT spent at least $75 million for lawmakers’ projects alone. Many of the legislative requests since 2012 did not include specific cost estimates, meaning the total figure for legislative requests exceeds $163 million. Eleven of them bumped higher priority safety projects.</p>
<p>MDOT did not provide information about who made the requests, which vary in scope and size, and include:</p>
<p>• In 2013, 2014 and 2015, lawmakers asked MDOT to spend $150,000 a year “to conduct a study on monorail transportation in Tunica and DeSoto counties.” MDOT did not fund the project because, responding to questions from Mississippi Today: “Locals are not interested.”</p>
<p>• In 2015, lawmakers asked MDOT to spend $10 million for the Highway 25/Lakeland Drive expansion project. This project included the phase to build the $2 million frontage road to Lt. Gov. Reeves’ neighborhood. MDOT chose to fund this project, spending $43.5 million on the entire project to date.</p>
<p>• In 2015, lawmakers asked MDOT to pay $3 million to Lafayette County for costs of extending West Oxford Loop to College Hill Road as what is described in documents as a “local public agencies project.” The project is currently under construction.</p>
<p>• In 2015 and 2016, lawmakers asked MDOT to give $4.25 million to the quasi–governmental East Metropolitan Corridor Commission, which is constructing a thoroughfare that connects Lakeland Drive in Flowood to I-20 in Brandon. MDOT fulfilled both requests and helped the commission obtain federal funds. Through its response, MDOT told Mississippi Today spending money on the project delayed safety priority projects and had not been in MDOT’s spending plan.</p>
<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves announces a major infrastructure proposal at a news conference on in spring 2018. He is joined by Finance chairman Sen. Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall, and Transportation chairman Sen. Willie Simmons, D-Cleveland.</p>
<p>In addition to criticism, MDOT has been a target of several rounds of budget cuts in recent years, which has forced to the agency to focus exclusively on maintenance and not new construction.</p>
<p>McGrath, the agency’s executive director, broke down the dire situation to lawmakers in a legislative hearing in August 2017, saying that if current funding trends continue, the department would only be able to pay for a fraction of needed repairs in a given year.</p>
<p>But while lawmakers continued asking MDOT for earmarks, top legislators with Reeves leading the charge have stridently criticized the agency and its leadership and raised questions about efficiency in the department, which manages a budget overseen by the three-member elected Mississippi Transportation Commission.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2016, Reeves and Gunn hosted a series of legislative hearings to put MDOT’s spending under the microscope. They pointedly questioned MDOT leaders about agency travel, the size of its vehicle fleet and why specific projects remained uncompleted.</p>
<p>During the 2018 legislative session, Reeves pushed a sweeping infrastructure funding reform bill that would have broadly stripped MDOT’s spending authority of hundreds of millions of dollars per year; tempers flared among the rank-and-file in both the Senate and House over Reeves’ proposal, which ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez, who formerly chaired the House Transportation Committee, believes some of the legislative projects addressed legitimate needs but is concerned how many of them bumped higher-need projects.</p>
<p>“The concern is that some of these rural areas might have been waiting eight, nine, 10 years. Now their project (which had been prioritized by MDOT experts) gets bumped,” Johnson said, referring to the projects. “I don’t think that is OK, especially considering the revenue restraints we have.”</p>

<p>TODAY IN MISSISSIPPI: News from and about our state</p>
<p>Three African American men in the Delta filed a federal lawsuit accusing the state of gerrymandering one of its districts in direct violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</p>
<p>Civil Rights attorneys argue in the lawsuit that the boundaries of Senate District 22, which is located primarily in the Mississippi Delta, intentionally dilute African-American voting strength in the area. And they’ve asked U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves to order state officials to redraw the district before statewide elections in 2019.</p>
<p>“There will be a lot of focus on redistricting when election lines everywhere are redrawn after the 2020 census,” said Jackson civil rights attorney Rob McDuff, who is working with the Mississippi Center for Justice on the lawsuit. “But because there is a problem with District 22 that needs to be cured before the census and before the 2019 election, we are bringing this case now.”</p>
<p>The defendants are Gov. Phil Bryant, Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, and Attorney General Jim Hood.</p>
<p>Senate District 22, which has been held by Buck Clarke, R-Hollandale, since 2004, covers six counties in the Delta and central Mississippi. The district is irregularly-shaped, with a wide center and two narrow arms, one that reaches north past Cleveland and another that reaches into Madison County, ending at the Barnett Reservoir. The distance between the two points, as the crow flies, is 102 miles. Mississippi, which has 52 senate districts, is approximately 320 miles top to bottom.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs, Joseph Thomas of Yazoo County, Vernon Ayers of Washington County, and Melvin Lawson of Bolivar County, all live in District 22. Those three counties are in the Delta and predominantly African American.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Monday, alleges that state officers elongated the district, adding Madison County’s wealthy and largely white neighborhoods, to limit the district’s black voting age population to 50.8 percent. They argue that this, combined with white bloc voting and lower African American turnout, has consistently diluted the voting strength of one of the most African American parts of the state.</p>
<p>“Gerrymandering stands as one of the greatest threats to democracy today. The current districting plan in Mississippi’s state Senate effectively denies African American voters an equal opportunity to participate in the political process,” said Kristen Clarke, President and Executive Director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.</p>
<p>The Mississippi Center for Justice and McDuff were joined by the Lawyer’s Committee, the Waters Kraus law firm of Dallas, Tex., and Cleveland attorney, Ellis Turnage.</p>

<p>For those who argue the education system is broken, Barbara Logan Smith disagrees.</p>
<p>“In truth, the system is doing exactly what it was designed to do because it was never designed to actually get all kids to the place where they knew what they needed to know and could do what they needed to do to actually be viable citizens in the world,” said Smith, executive director of Teach for America’s greater Delta region.</p>
<p>Staci Lewis, Teach for America</p>
<p>Barbara Logan Smith, executive director of Teach for America’s greater Delta region</p>
<p>The longtime educator spoke to a full room at a community forum in west Jackson Friday morning, where she discussed the organization’s work in Mississippi.</p>
<p>Teach For America is a national organization known for taking recent college graduates and placing them in underserved communities across the country. The teachers, known as corps members, go through summer training before they start the school year and each commit to a two-year period with the organization.</p>
<p>Critics argue the organization places inexperienced educators into classrooms and communities they are not prepared to serve, and that many of these teachers end up leaving their schools after their commitment is up.</p>
<p>“We know you can’t take folks who haven’t been invested in teaching and just throw them into the classroom,” Smith said.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the organization announced the Mississippi and Arkansas offices of Teach for America would merge into one region. In preparation for their first year of teaching, corps members spend several weeks of the summer in training in the Delta. There are about 100 teachers doing this right now, she said. Once the school year begins, corps members receive professional development every other week and attend four training summits throughout the year.</p>
<p>“They’re not playing with children’s lives, they understand that we have a responsibility to set these kids up to exceed the expectations of their testing,” Smith said.</p>
<p>Smith acknowledged that the state is facing teacher shortage, but that solving the shortage problem is “actually not what our organization is about.”</p>
<p>The Mississippi Department of Education currently lists about 1,000 vacancies, although only about 650 of those are for teaching positions. All vacancies on the site are self-reported by districts, so the number could be higher due to some districts choosing not to post job openings on the site.</p>
<p>“Our real work is about ending educational inequity and building educational excellence,” she said. “That work is connected, but it’s different from addressing the teacher shortage.”</p>
<p>Everyone is born with the capacity to do great things, she said, and it’s TFA’s mission to set children up to do this.</p>
<p>“The truth of the matter is as you look across our nation, what you consistently see is that kids whose families don’t have a lot of money and kids who have a little too much melanin in their skin and kids whose families speak another language other than English are often kids who never have the opportunity to actualize that capacity.”</p>
<p>During the 2017-18 school year 131 corps members served in Mississippi. Post-merger, Smith told the room on Friday that in the upcoming school year about 200 teachers will serve in the Mississippi and Arkansas region. Corps members are placed in school districts based on need — schools that have enough room for multiple corps members are an attractive option because it allows for a sense of community. The organization also considers whether there are TFA alumni in the area to offer fellowship and support.</p>
<p>In Mississippi, TFA teachers work in Jackson, the Delta, and Holly Springs.</p>

<p>Mississippi Center for Public Policy</p>
<p>Gov. Phil Bryant announced on Friday he would appoint Shad White as the state’s next state auditor.</p>
<p>Shad White, 32, a former Rhodes Scholar and Harvard law school graduate, was appointed Friday by Gov. Phil Bryant to replace outgoing state Auditor Stacey Pickering.</p>
<p>“He is a millennial who came back from Oxford England” where he studied as a Rhodes Scholar and earned a master’s degree in economics history, the governor said. Bryant added that he was influenced by the fact that White turned down the potential “of earning a lot of money in New York” to return to his native Mississippi and engage in public service.</p>
<p>White had previously worked for the governor, including managing his 2015 re-election campaign, and was currently serving as the director of the conservative-leaning Mississippi Justice Institute and lead attorney for the Mississippi Center for Public Policy. He also is a graduate of the University of Mississippi and was appointed as a special prosecutor in Rankin County.</p>
<p>“Shad’s credentials and ability are without question,” Bryant said. “He has proven himself a champion of limited and efficient government that serves the taxpayers. He is the perfect fit for this important office, and I am pleased he has accepted this appointment.”</p>
<p>Bryant made the announcement Friday at the Governor’s Mansion — in the same room where in October 1996 then-Gov. Kirk Fordice named Bryant, a state House member from Rankin County, to fill the vacant auditor’s post.</p>
<p>Bryant acknowledged the symmetry, though, in 1996 Bryan previously had run for elected office. White has never run for public office. White said his last successful campaign was for class favorite at Northeast Jones High School in 2003. His next campaign will be in 2019 for a full four-year term as auditor – one of eight statewide elected posts in Mississippi.</p>
<p>“I’m honored by the faith Gov. Bryant has placed in me with this appointment,” said White, a native of tiny Sandersville where his father is the mayor and is the person he said taught him the importance of public service.</p>
<p>He added, “I’m looking forward to being the watchdog of (taxpayers’) hard-earned dollars. I’ve committed to the governor and will commit to Mississippians that I’ll bring every ounce of energy I have and whatever talent God gave me to do this the right way.</p>
<p>“I’ll always tell you the truth, even if the truth is uncomfortable. I’ll always treat our public officials fairly, and I’ll do everything in my power to make sure Mississippi’s future is free from corruption.”</p>
<p>White acknowledged he approached the governor about the vacancy created when Pickering, a fellow Jones Countian, resigned to become executive director of the state’s Veterans Affairs Board. The governor said other seasoned politicians expressed interest in the position of auditor, but he believed that White was “uniquely qualified” for the post.</p>
<p>Since 1996, just four statewide elected officials had resigned before their terms had expired. Three of those four times, Mississippi governors filled those spots with other elected officials.</p>
<p>Bryant also bucked convention in April by appointing Agriculture Commissioner Cindy Hyde-Smith to the U.S. Senate to replace retiring Sen. Thad Cochran.</p>
<p>White is the youngest statewide officer in recent memory. Ray Mabus was 35 in 1983 when he was elected to the post of auditor, as was Mike Moore when he was elected attorney general in 1987. Dick Molpus was 34 when he was elected secretary of state in 1983.</p>

<p>FLEET Creative’s July Portfolio Social is Thursday, July 12, from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at Mantle. in Fondren. Photo by Stephen Wilson.</p>
<p>JACKSON — For Roderick Red, who owns film company Red Squared Productions, it’s important for local creative professionals have a space to learn and network. His organization, FLEET Creative, which seeks to educate, equip and connect local creative professionals, is helping further that goal.</p>
<p>Red, a Jackson native, received his bachelor’s degree in media production from the University of Southern Mississippi in 2011 He came back to Jackson in 2014 to complete the business advantage program at Millsaps College. He started Red Squared in April 2012.</p>
<p>Red says part of the inspiration for FLEET came from being Southern Cult, a local collective for creatives.</p>
<p>“I always tell people that Southern Cult is kind of like the Avengers, and if Red Squared is Iron Man, then Southern Cult bands together to tackle big projects,” he says. “Everyone has their own individuality, but they also have that collective group. From that idea, I kind of came up with the idea for FLEET.”</p>
<p>Last year, he hosted a test-run event at Flamingo, where he brought in speakers such as artist, graphic designer and fellow Southern Cult member Tyler Tadlock to talk about the vision of the organization. Red says that one of his favorite parts of this process so far has been the feedback from this test run, as well as the support from the local community.</p>
<p>Starting tonight, Thursday, July 12 at 5:30 p.m., FLEET will begin hosting a monthly meeting where creative professionals can network.</p>
<p>FLEET plans to meet on the second Thursday of every month, and Red plans to have two types of monthly meetings: a portfolio showcase and an educational workshop. Red and Erin Foster, a local graphic designer, will be the first to showcase their portfolios at tonight’s event.</p>
<p>“First off, we want to showcase work that’s really well-done,” Red says. “Secondly, and only after the first, we want to give people an outlet to showcase their work. We’re trying to inspire people.”</p>
<p>With FLEET Creative, he hopes to inspire local Jackson artists to work harder with the hopes to become professionals of their field.</p>
<p>“The only thing that separates an artist and a creative professional is that you get paid for what you do, and if you want to get better, you can come, look and see what it looks like to be a creative professional,” he says.</p>
<p>“… I want to create an organization for creative people in Jackson who come out of school and have degrees, and who want to come and learn and grow their business. … (FLEET is) upping the game of creative people here. If they see other well-done creative things, then they themselves will start to create better things as well.”</p>
<p>For the first few months, FLEET will host events at Mantle., but the plan is to host it in different locations around Jackson. Red eventually wants the organization to be large enough to hold its own conference, bringing in people around the state and the country.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen through my experience how you can grow creative minds,” he says. “I learned quickly that it’s not about what you know, it’s about who you know. Collaboration is a great way to grow.”</p>
<p>Although FLEET caters to creative professionals, the meetings and workshops are open to the public. As the organization continues to grow, Red also hopes to grow his team and find volunteers for the monthly events.</p>
<p>“We want to grow as a vehicle for people who want to be connected to creative things,” Red says.</p>
<p>FLEET’s July Portfolio Social is Thursday, July 12, from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at Mantle. (622 Duling Ave.). For more information, find the event on Facebook or email <a href="mailto:Roderick@redsquaredproductions.com">Roderick@redsquaredproductions.com</a>.</p>

<h2><a class="Reimagining_9_Acres_Downtown_9824"></a>Reimagining 9 Acres Downtown</h2>

<p>At the Downtown Design Dialogue on June 30, the City’s Planning Department displayed renderings to spark conversation around what land in front of the convention center can become. Photo by Jackson Department of Planning and Development</p>
<p>JACKSON — If downtown Jackson were a person, she would be an upstanding woman with a lot of scars, living in the shadows of painful memories. Despite her propensity to bask in nostalgia and hypotheticals about what could have been, she would be one of those people with strange, unmerited optimism considering how many people have abandoned her—she believes her people will come back to her.</p>
<p>As a capital city, albeit a small one, Jackson is not the social or economic hub that it should be. Nearly 20,000 people in the daytime workforce flood its “business improvement district,” and they don’t stay once they’re off the clock.</p>
<p>However, the City is in the early phases of developing roughly 9 acres in front of the Jackson Convention Complex. This could be the catalyst, and makeover, that downtown needs to get her groove back.</p>
<p>“This is a huge opportunity for us to rethink what our downtown can be,” Travis Crabtree, a member of the City’s long-range planning team, says.</p>
<p>Talking Design</p>
<p>The City’s Planning and Development Department hosted an event on June 30 called “Downtown Design Dialogue”—colloquialized to D3—where the public came to share hopes about what could fill the undeveloped acres largely functioning as parking lots for now.</p>
<p>The backdrop of D3 was perfect: the large floor-to-ceiling windows offered a direct line of sight to where a $315-million development could go in the next six to eight years.</p>
<p>More than 100 people took the escalator up to the second floor of the convention center. After signing in, groups cycled through presentations from members of the planning department. Large-format printouts of downtown’s history and renderings of what it could possibly look like in the future rested on large cinder blocks.</p>
<p>In 2008 the City took out a $7-million loan from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to develop the land across from the convention center. But, after the initial developer that purchased the land from the City went bankrupt, the property went back to the City and the Jackson Redevelopment Authority, and nothing else happened.</p>
<p>The City still owes that loan to HUD, but Mukesh Kumar, director of planning and development, established a “workout plan” with the federal agency last fall to give the administration an opportunity to secure a master developer once more. Part of the workout plan was to bring in a team of consultants to do a market analysis of downtown Jackson.</p>
<p>Chicago-based Hunden Strategic Partners hosted listening sessions</p>
<p>in the winter prior to compiling a roughly 100-page study with recommendations about the downtown area. Some of those findings were on display at D3.</p>
<p>Kumar, a brand-new father for the first time, welcomed people at the first introductory station in a striped linen shirt, navy pants and brown sandals. Von Anderson and Mike Davis from the planning department walked groups through the highlights of the next station, focusing on the downtown market analysis.</p>
<p>Approximately 485 people live downtown, and 87 percent of the residential units in the area are occupied. Eighty percent of those living in the apartments inside of the Standard Life and King Edward are from the suburbs of Jackson.</p>
<p>“If you go to Columbus, Mississippi, they will have more people living in their downtown than the capital city of Mississippi. That just don’t seem right—however, that’s why we’re here,” Davis said.</p>
<p>Swim, Boat, Gather</p>
<p>A middle-aged black woman named Gwen (she declined to give her last name) was among one of the groups. When she permanently relocated to Jackson, she started off living downtown, but left because she wanted the option to own her domicile and desired amenities she could walk to—her dream is to be able to walk everywhere.</p>
<p>Downtown Jackson does not seem walkable right now because things are so spread out. Also, you would mainly see parking lots because that is what comprises most of downtown: 87 acres of parking structures. Twenty-six percent of downtown land is used for parking.</p>
<p>Download .PDF</p>
<p>The next station was Crabtree’s. As part of the build-out, Crabtree and his team envision some residential apartments among condominiums, office space, vertical parking, green spaces, a movie theater, and eventually, a hotel connecting to the convention center.</p>
<p>There could even be a water feature making use of the stormwater, as the convention center and undeveloped land in front of it are right in the middle of a floodplain, and Town Creek runs underneath it all. The idea would be to open it up and create a body of water where people could swim, boat and gather.</p>
<p>Finally, attendees filled out color-coded cards to note things they wanted to see in downtown Jackson. Then, everyone pinned the card exactly where the proposed idea should go in the city, and ideas were connected with colorful strings of yarn.</p>
<p>Some made serious suggestions. Charles Hatcher, the former director of finance and administration who resigned suddenly at the end of May, showed up to D3, giddy and smiling with his former coworkers like a recent graduate back on campus for the first time since his glory days. Hatcher suggested a convenience store on the perimeter of downtown.</p>
<p>Others made light of the activity—one person suggested “Shade” as a program the city should implement. It instantly became a fan favorite.</p>
<p>More green spaces, however, are not only cooling, they also represent a shift Kumar wants to achieve with his long-range planning group: going from seeing the worth in consumption to valuing production. For Kumar, the very act of being in a space is a way to produce quality of life for instance. He can’t put a pricing model on the concept, but Kumar’s goal is to have a city space where people want to linger and make memories.</p>
<p>Download .PDF</p>
<p>“These people are not thinking that by the very act of you being here in downtown you’re producing,” Kumar said. “But most of the time people don’t value that. They just see the value in how much can I consume.”</p>
<p>Rare Equitable Approach</p>
<p>After the event some did linger in the way city planners want to happen regularly downtown. Matt Bolian was among them in his “JXN” shirt. Bolian left the area to serve in the military for seven years, and cried when he found out he had to come back to Jackson.</p>
<p>“Jackson sucks; that’s just the reality,” he said after D3. As someone who worked on the Capitol Art Lofts downtown, Bolian is excited about being part of the movement to make the City better, but he still feels that the place, quite frankly, still sucks. But, he says, if you want to be in a place to make a difference, he sees Jackson as a top-five option for that.</p>
<p>Even after Bolian left, Kumar stuck around and went back over some of the renderings. He is excited about the opportunity to develop such a huge portion of downtown, but he wants to make sure it happens equitably. He hopes to start funding the City’s affordable-housing trust fund, especially for the Fondren area—no one will be displaced with new downtown apartments because the area is so empty. This is not the case further north. Kumar hopes that as new opportunities attract new residents, a variety of people can benefit.</p>
<p>“It would be entirely impractical to think that you should just try to attract 5,000 rich people or people who can afford it directly at the market rate,” he said.</p>
<p>This equitable approach in favor of community input is rare. In most cases, communities get to react to a design firm’s prototype just before a groundbreaking. Kumar and his team will take feedback and come up with other iterations to ultimately roll into an RFP for a master developer.</p>
<p>“It’s not a developer’s job to watch out for the interest of the public. … That’s our job. We have to do that,” Kumar said.</p>

<p>Some Jacksonians may not have been familiar with the Poor People’s Campaign before a group of protestors burned the state flag in front of the Governor’s Mansion on Monday, June 25, while roaring, “No more hate in our state.”</p>
<p>Maybe those people haven’t been watching the evening news or maybe they don’t have their finger on the pulse of social unrest in Mississippi, or maybe they just don’t care enough to keep up with the laundry list of complaints brought forth by a group that seeks to lift the state’s people out of poverty.</p>
<p>It may not be easy to see the connection between poverty and the state flag, but if the demonstration on Capitol Street taught any lesson, it was that the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign is not only about poverty.</p>
<p>In summer 2017, I first encountered the Poor People’s Campaign in a muggy gymnasium of Madison S. Palmer High School in Marks, Miss., my stomach bursting with fried catfish and Delta grits. I was sitting at a round picnic table with Sen. David Lee Jordan and retired journalist and professor Hodding Carter III.</p>
<p>At that time, I was filming a documentary about Sen. Robert F. Kennedy’s tour of the Delta in April 1967, and the Jackson office of Marian Wright Edelman’s Children’s Defense Fund had invited me to join the 50th anniversary tour of the Delta. Edelman was a hero of mine, a titan of the Civil Rights Movement in Mississippi.</p>
<p>As Edelman spoke, and as a cohort of community organizers followed to testify to the leaps and bounds Quitman County was making toward prosperity, Jordan and Carter told me about the significance of Marks, a town I personally had never heard of and had never dreamt of visiting.</p>
<p>They told me about Rev. Martin Luther King’s visit in 1966. He wept tears as he encountered the Delta’s poverty, a rare breed of all-encompassing, racialized suffocation, they said. They told me about the birth of the first Poor People’s Campaign and the Mule Train. All of it had begun right there in Marks.</p>
<p>As a history nerd, I was eating it up and wanted to know more.</p>
<p>So when Jordan checked his phone, said his goodbyes to Carter and myself, and left the gym, I was disappointed. I leaned over and asked Carter why he left.</p>
<p>“Two boys were just shot in his district,” Carter said.</p>
<p>Less than a year later, when Revs. William Barber and Liz Theoharis traveled to Marks to organize and galvanize support for a new, comprehensive Poor People’s Campaign, I remembered Jordan scurrying out of the assembly to respond to another community crisis.</p>
<p>The Poor People’s Campaign in Mississippi is a reaction to those two boys being shot in Greenwood. It’s a reaction to decades of violence ripping through poor communities in the state. It’s a reaction to decades of neglect, hunger, manipulation, disfranchisement and social asphyxiation that have made life as a poor person in America unbearable.</p>
<p>This movement, the movement that brought those protesters to the governor’s front door on Capitol Street, is not only a call for economic reform or a new welfare initiative; it’s a demand for an overhaul of the American fabric of inequality.</p>
<p>Inequality is a holistic infection. It invades homes and tears through communities, often through violence, such as in Greenwood last summer and in communities across Mississippi every day. And the state flag, in its own covert fashion, sends the message that the state government is not here to help.</p>
<p>The 2018 Poor People’s Campaign, self-described as a “national call for moral revival,” operates on intersectional principles to address these issues, principles that have reverberated from Ferguson, Mo., to Cleveland to Jackson, Miss. Namely, that no one in the wealthiest nation in the history of human civilization, which proclaims itself to be the oldest democracy in the world, should be forced to live or die without even a chance to truly live. It’s not just about poverty. It’s about dignity.</p>
<p>At the Old Capitol Museum in downtown Jackson, there is a board where visitors post messages. The museum was one of the first places I visited when my family moved to the city after I left home for college, and I was struck by the thoughts people before me had left behind.</p>
<p>Among the comments, scribbled in handwriting indicative of scribes young and old, were a number of notes imploring elected officials to change the state flag.</p>
<p>Visitors cited legacies of slavery, of hate, of violence, of a generational trauma that students should not be reminded of every time they walk into their public schools—the erasure of their human right to dignity. The Poor People’s Campaign is fighting for them, too.</p>

<h2><a class="Mississippi_Immigrants_Organize_Against_Atrocities_9962"></a>Mississippi Immigrants: Organize Against ‘Atrocities’</h2>

<p>Melinda Medina, a community organizer for the Mississippi Immigrants’ Rights Alliance, speaks at a rally to end family separation on June 30. Photo by Marie Weidmayer</p>
<p>JACKSON — “Get out of our country, you don’t belong!” When Melinda Medina hears those words, she feels sad for the person targeting her as a Hispanic woman who descends from a Mexican family. Although the American was born in Texas, she believes her face, along with those around her, are reminders of the “atrocities their white ancestors engaged in.”</p>
<p>To Medina, America’s immigration policies are personal, including those that separate children from their families such as the “zero tolerance” practices President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions began instituting in April, including for people seeking asylum from violence. Medina’s family includes undocumented individuals who are married to United States citizens and have children who are citizens.</p>
<p>While her immediate family is legally in the United States, Medina said deportation and separation remain a scary prospect in her extended family, and the government could separate her nieces and nephews from their parents.</p>
<p>Medina attended and spoke at the Families Belong Together rally on June 30 in downtown Jackson because she does not believe in the U.S.’ current policies.</p>
<p>More 100 people attended the rally, held outside the gates of the Governor’s Mansion. They stood in the mid-day sun and 100-degree temperatures to voice displeasure with the separation of more than 2,300 children from their families and the slow reunification process, especially due to missing records.</p>
<p>“We are against the separation of families, and we are against them being held in detention for an indefinite amount of time,” Medina told the Jackson Free Press. “Not only that, we’re against the prosecution of asylum seekers.”</p>
<p>“Tell me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like!”; “The people united will never be divided”; and “Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here” echoed throughout the rally.</p>
<p>“Look in the mirror and what do you see? Do you see the nations you have destroyed to create your privilege?” Medina said. “There were 2,000 children who were ripped apart from their families, now suffering in detention. … Do innocent children whose only crime is existing belong in jail?”</p>
<p>‘People Heard the Cries’</p>
<p>The government sent the children separated from their families to at least 15 states across the nation, including Michigan, Oregon and Connecticut, The Washington Post reported. They live in a variety of places, including foster care, an old Walmart store and tents. Mississippi apparently did not receive any children, even though the governor supports Trump’s immigration policies.</p>
<p>The federal government has separated families from children after their arrest on the misdemeanor charge of crossing the border illegally, with many of them planning to ask for asylum, which must be requested on U.S. soil. Some of the later-separated families were turned away and not allowed to cross into official border stations even though they were seeking asylum, which is legal.</p>
<p>Marie Weidmayer</p>
<p>In Michigan, three detained fathers who were in other states received transfers to a new jail, which moved them closer to their children. The children are in the care of Bethany Christian Services, an organization that provides services such as adoption and foster care. Then on July 10, the fathers were reunited with their children, although it is unclear if the fathers and children will be released, the Detroit Free Press reported.</p>
<p>Reunification for all children and their families is supposed to happen by July 26, and those children 5 years old and younger should be reunited on July 10, U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw ruled on June 26. About 100 children younger than 5 wait to be reunited, but the Trump administration said it will not meet the deadline. Instead, about 38 children were reunited with parents, and 27 children are not eligible for reunification, a filing from the U.S. Department of Justice shows.</p>
<p>But, reuniting families only to house them in detention facilities is not OK, Executive Director of American Civil Liberties Union Mississippi Jennifer Riley-Collins said at the rally.</p>
<p>“We don’t want our children behind bars,” Riley-Collins said. “We don’t want our families behind bars. So we the people heard the cries. We the people spoke out. We are going to continue to speak out. That is how we take or country back. Not just in the courtroom, but in the streets and the ballot box.”</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee ruled July 9 that families cannot be reunified and still be detained as a family. The ruling that set the deadlines for family reunification also means families can no longer be separated, leaving the administration in limbo as it scrambles to find records for the families it separated.</p>
<p>Gee suggested releasing families on bond until their next court date. At the time of publication, it is unclear what the Trump administration will do.</p>
<p>‘Abhorrent Damage’</p>
<p>An abundance of white, male lawmakers who benefit politically and otherwise from a harsh immigration system exacerbates the problem, ultimately oppressing minority voices, Medina said.</p>
<p>“The problem with our government leaders is they no longer fear ‘We the people,’” Medina said. “We have allowed the power to shift. But, we can, and we will take it back. Together we can make a difference. Let’s show them, who we have hired by vote to do the job we have elected for them to do, just what it means to be ‘We the people.’”</p>
<p>Gov. Phil Bryant was all-in on Trump’s family-immigration policy from the beginning. “Like I shared with President Trump at the White House recently, America is a nation of laws, and I am grateful his administration is enforcing them. Every state must make similar decisions when removing a child who has been neglected or abused by their parents. It is an unfortunate reality of our justice system,” he told The Clarion-Ledger.</p>
<p>No U.S. law, however, requires separating children from parents who cross the border illegally or try to seek asylum to escape violence or domestic abuse back home.</p>
<p>An essential part of taking the power back is voting in the Nov. 6 election and in the November 2019 election, because state and federal representation matters, Danyelle Holmes, the national organizer for the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign, said at the rally.</p>
<p>Mississippi Alliance of State Employees President Brenda Scott spoke about how workers’ rights are reduced and voting is the best way to change the issue.</p>
<p>“If we don’t go in the polls, put all our differences aside, vote for the bread and butter issues, vote for what unites us, then we can blame anybody but ourselves,” Scott said. “We’ve got to make a change. Everybody leave here with the determination to do more than what you did before you got here.”</p>
<p>However, voting might not be enough to make a difference, and more direct action might be necessary, speaker Joe Jordan said.</p>
<p>“If being comfortable and being legitimate and being polite is more important to you than protecting our families and our way of life, I don’t care who votes, we’re not going to change anything,” Jordan said.</p>
<p>No matter what, the drive to change immigration policies and help minorities succeed in the United States must continue, Riley-Collins said.</p>
<p>“We’re going to keep resisting,” Riley-Collins said.</p>
<p>“We’re going to keep fighting in the court. We’re going to keep marching in the street. We’re going to hold Congress, we’re going to hold this governor accountable. Because abhorrent damage is being done to young lives.”</p>

<p>Bright morning light beamed through the windows in Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba’s meeting space that connects to his office on the third floor of Jackson City Hall. It was the kind of sunshine that creates a glare, posing an issue for the mayor on July 5—he needed to get the best view of his father in archival footage from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The son and other chief administrators were meeting with a campaign supporter, Dominic DeLeo, who had brought clips to share following a meeting about the “One Lake” proposal.</p>
<p>“That’s my dad!” The mayor yelled out, as the late Chokwe Lumumba emerged on the screen, slender and consumed by a well-rounded afro. The mayor’s driver, Ervin Bradley, who goes by Hondo, got up to close the blinds. As everyone around the table swiveled the chairs to face the screen, the room fell silent, mainly because the volume on this footage was so low.</p>
<p>The video came from Land Celebration Day, which took place in Bolton in western Hinds County back in 1971.</p>
<p>The event represented a benchmark in the Republic of New Afrika’s plan to create independent black communities in the Deep South. The plan was for Mississippi to be an anchor, considering its potential to become a black empowerment zone. The hope was that black people from everywhere would come here as refugees of racism, white supremacy and poverty.</p>
<p>Law enforcement on every level grew concerned about the celebration set for March 1971. State, county and federal officials raided RNA member’s homes and arrested them for being armed, as they almost always were. At the same time, musicians and other invited guests declined to attend the land celebration.</p>
<p>However, then-Bolton City Councilman Bennie Thompson and state Rep. Robert Clark, Mississippi’s first black legislator since Reconstruction, spoke out against the police interference in defense of the RNA, reads Akinyele Omowale Umoja’s 2013 book “We Will Shoot Back: Armed Resistance in the Mississippi Freedom Movement.”</p>
<p>“This is where the term ‘Free the Land’ comes from,” the mayor said as he watched the video. Chief of Staff Safiya Omari and Lumumba shouted out names of the various RNA members they recognized on the screen such as Alajo Adegbalola, whom Omari and Lumumba called referred to as just “Brother Alajo.”</p>
<p>The mayor’s eyes lit up, in awe of how young his father looked, a man he said he does not recall without gray hair. The elder Lumumba was in his early 20s then, wearing a black turtleneck and black jacket.</p>
<p>“It’s funny, you look just like him,” Jackson’s Chief Administrative Officer Robert Blaine said to his boss. Blaine also serves as the interim director of the Department of Finance since Charles Hatcher resigned the position at the end of May. Others around the room remarked that the father and son make the same gestures, as they both talk with their hands.</p>
<p>The mayor wanted to see footage of the barricade of law enforcement trying to prevent RNA members from having the land celebration. His father was head of security at that time, and he went to talk to the officers.</p>
<p>“My dad’s words to them were: If there’s going to be bloodshed, it’s going to be on both sides, right? And that’s when he said it opened up like the Red Sea,” the mayor told his colleagues.</p>
<p>The late Lumumba captured the room through that television screen as he was known to do during his life. His principles, values and vision cemented a world-renowned legacy that his namesake most closely adopted. But, this mayor also wants to make a name for himself.</p>
<p>“I feel I always reflect back on my dad because he was my hero, but I feel comfortable being me,” the mayor told the Jackson Free Press. “So it’s a path that he led me on, but it’s my own walk.”</p>
<p>Scratching the Surface</p>
<p>Jackson’s youngest mayor, now 35, assumed his official duties on July 3, 2017, and since then, he has been on a determined-but-rocky mission, as the world looks on. The mayor knows that his popularity stems from who his parents were, but also who the nation is in this moment.</p>
<p>“I think also our willingness to embrace radical instead of running away from it is something that the country is kind of in this curious space where, whether you’re considered far-left or far-right, we’re exploring change,” Lumumba said sitting in a wheeled office chair in the same place he watched footage of his dad earlier.</p>
<p>Left to right: Dominic DeLeo, Safiya Omari, the mayor and the JFP’s Ko Bragg watch 1971 MDAH footage of the elder Chokwe Lumumba on July 5 in City Hall.</p>
<p>Omari has served as the chief of staff for both Lumumbas. She is careful about comparing the two.</p>
<p>“Chokwe Sr. was very thoughtful and deliberate,” she told the Jackson Free Press. “But I can’t say that without it seeming like he’s not,” Omari added, gesturing toward the mayor’s office down the hall.</p>
<p>“He’s also thoughtful and deliberate, but in a different way.”</p>
<p>Omari finds things more fast-paced in this era, and although both men had the same vision, she says the elder Lumumba had a council that was willing to work really closely with him. Now she finds more resistance.</p>
<p>“With this council, I think Antar had some big shoes to fill just really based on the name,” she said.</p>
<p>City Council Vice President Virgi Lindsay of Ward 7 has been critical of council decorum in her first year in the role, and hopes to get more efficient.</p>
<p>“I’ve come to realize that we all are very committed to the City, and really at the end of the day we all are motivated by our desire to see a better City. But, do I wish we could have the one-hour power meeting? You bet,” she said in an interview.</p>
<p>In this next year, and after a number of open clashes with the council over late-hour requests and the thinly stretched budget, Omari wants to step into the role of facilitating communication early on with the council so that the administration can hash out everything before things go on the agenda. However, newly minted Council President Melvin Priester Jr. feels immune to the back-and-forth in meetings because he’s a lawyer by trade, but he also finds them necessary for transparency’s sake.</p>
<p>“[P]eople all the time say you should have the meeting before the meeting, but that goes against the spirit of the Open Meetings Act,” Priester said in a phone interview. “So a certain amount of this stuff does have to occur publicly.”</p>
<p>After five years on the city council, Priester has gotten used to how administrations spend the first year getting settled in, then year two and three implementing things so that city officials can show results in year four—the re-election year.</p>
<p>Although the mayor campaigned on taking a radical stance, Priester finds that municipal government should be boring, but if the goal is transformation, then capitalizing on technology and operations would be a game changer.</p>
<p>“From my end, effective technocratic government would be a radical accomplishment,” Priester said.</p>
<p>Omari now wonders if they’ve been radical enough. She paused, and then laughed after mulling that question over.</p>
<p>“The younger me would say, ‘nah, we haven’t been radical.’ But the older, more seasoned me would say ‘yeah, some of the things we’ve done have been,’” she said.</p>
<p>Avoiding the Jackson Public School District state takeover is one example that virtually everyone in City Hall agrees demonstrates not only the best day of the last year, but also one of the most radical things to happen in this administration. A few months after the mayor took office, he and his advisers reached an unexpected compromise with conservative Gov. Phil Bryant to keep the school district in local control.</p>
<p>JFP’s stories about the state takeover of the Jackson Public Schools district</p>
<p>The new deal meant the past school board had to resign, and the mayor had to appoint a brand new one. Blaine praises the new board, especially President Jeanne Hairston for her leadership. But, the board is still short one member, whom Blaine says should be confirmed this summer. Omari feels like this bipartisan workaround really put Lumumba on the map.</p>
<p>“People talk about the national exposure that he has and all the places that he’s invited to speak … but a lot of that came out of the fact that he was bold enough to expend political capital to step out there and say, ‘I’m going to work with this conservative governor to save our schools because our kids are what matters,’” she said.</p>
<p>Bobbing, Weaving in Crisis</p>
<p>City Hall, the edifice, is sturdy. Slaves built it by hand in the 1840s, and it withstood the Civil War when Confederate and Union soldiers laid their heads in the hospital erected in the government building. Inside, however, Lumumba and his closest advisers, hailing primarily from academia, have had to get their hands dirty with proverbial bricklaying.</p>
<p>Following the school-district emergency, the City bobbed and weaved through a winter water crisis, the ever-looming consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency over wastewater handling, and constant calls about insurmountable Siemens Inc. water bills past administrations have dealt with too. Additionally, Lumumba has had three police chiefs, a rising homicide count including multiple lethal officer-involved shootings, and the death of a local high school girl due to City negligence.</p>
<p>In almost every one of these situations, including Frances Fortner’s death, the City lacked the necessary protocols in place to respond effectively or to prevent such tragedies in the first place. The mayor said he realized the City’s foundation was “far worse than even anticipated.”</p>
<p>Radicalness has a less common definition: forming a basis or foundation. As constituents took campaign signs out of their yards and Lumumba and his appointees settled in, the administration had to apply their radical vision to structuring the city’s government. Still, Lumumba thinks they’re moving at the necessary pace to develop long-term change.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I realize that a lot of what we’ve been dealing with in our first year—there have been some radical things here and there—but to me they seem very basic and standard. But we’re only scratching the surface right now,” he said.</p>
<p>Owning a Fatal Failure</p>
<p>The day before Frances Fortner, 18, was set to graduate from Jackson Academy was one of the first sweltering days in the City. People had just begun to reintroduce open-toe shoes for the season, and businessmen rolled up the sleeves of their button-ups or traded them for polos all together. It was officially the season for riding with the windows down, or, if possible, with the top off altogether.</p>
<p>Fortner cruised down Ridgewood Road around noon on May 17 in her mother’s red convertible, her similarly colored hair probably tousling in the wind as she drove to meet her peers for graduation rehearsal. She went over an unsecured manhole, and her car did a 180-degree flip. Fortner was pronounced dead at an area hospital. Jacksonians shuddered.</p>
<p>Mayor Lumumba got word almost immediately. He was on the scene that afternoon with members of his security detail. Jackson’s first lady, Ebony Lumumba, said she called to check on him because she knows how personally he feels these types of things, especially as a parent.</p>
<p>“Heartbreaking isn’t a strong enough of a tone for what that felt like…,” Ebony said in a phone interview as the newest addition, Nubia, slept on her chest. “My husband is not a stranger to loss, and tragic loss at that, so that’s what I mean when I know how these types of things affect him.”</p>
<p>Ebony said their conversation focused on how to cater to the emotional well-being of the Fortner family. Four days later, the mayor took responsibility on behalf of the City for the incident that led to Fortner’s death. “I feel that it is my responsibility as mayor of this city to be honest to the Fortner family and to be honest to the citizens of Jackson and acknowledge that the City of Jackson failed to appropriately secure the site at the time that we learned that the manhole cover was not properly in place,” Lumumba said then.</p>
<p>Lumumba chose honesty, despite advisors urging him to choose another route.</p>
<p>“He received a lot of counsel against coming out and admitting that the City’s response was not what it should have been,” Omari said. “He listened to all the voices and he said, ‘Look y’all, my heart is telling me that this is what I have to do.’”</p>
<p>The mayor says the Fortner case was a personal test of his values.</p>
<p>“If I claim to be a radical mayor, and I claim we’re going to be a radical city, then we need to step away from the norms of finding every little way to avoid where we know we failed, and we have to be bold enough to even confront ourselves,” the mayor said.</p>
<p>As the mayor explained in the press conference following Fortner’s passing, Public Works is not a first-response department, but he still wants to get better equipped. The public-works director wants the same thing.</p>
<p>The perennially kind and professional Bob Miller, director of public works, who claims to like Monday mornings so much that he spends his Sunday evenings looking forward to the next day, said the Fortner death is a personal tragedy he and everyone involved will never quite get over. His nearly 37-year career in this business did not prepare him for that Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>“I’ve had occasions to be exposed when there was serious injury or loss of life,” Miller said. “But that one, I expect, will grieve me for the rest of my life. It drives me to make sure that and all of the other possible risks don’t ever happen again.”</p>
<p>Kicking the Can</p>
<p>When Bob Miller listens, he furrows his brow, and he has a tell whenever he is about to respond: his head bows into a sharp nod or two. He responds to everyone methodically, be it a council member or a reporter, often elevating conversation a step further with context and an endearing anecdote. Still, Miller feels as though there is a better listener: Mayor Lumumba.</p>
<p>“He is perhaps the best listener I’ve ever known in my life,” Miller said. “He listens very, very attentively. And he carefully considers what you say. And frankly, as a lifelong municipal employee, having a boss that actually listens and cares, that’s a good thing.” Miller has been one of Lumumba’s most fundamental hires, and he almost didn’t take the job.</p>
<p>At first, Miller was willing to serve as an unpaid adviser because he was not looking to move from New Orleans where he served as deputy director of the Sewerage and Water Board in New Orleans for eight years. Still, Lumumba remained persistent, asking Miller to pray for him and his City, and promising to do the same in return.</p>
<p>Finally, Lumumba invited Miller to church at Free Christian Church. Miller says that if you ever want to take somebody’s measure, you take him to church to see how he interacts with his family, his minister and his God. He found himself impressed with the mayor.</p>
<p>“And this is going to sound a little corny, but I did not want to miss out,” Miller said in an interview.</p>
<p>Miller says Lumumba stays engaged in every aspect of running the public-works department. The two men steered the City through a $1.6-million water crisis during which “peanut-brittle pipes,” as Miller called them, burst at rapid rates, and water pressure plummeted in the unusually frigid temperatures.</p>
<p>At one point, 70 percent of schools had little to no water pressure. When students finally went back to school in mid-January after an extended winter break, they were met with hand sanitizer, sack lunches and portable restrooms.</p>
<p>Robert Blaine reflected on this crisis made worse by the City’s lack of standard operating procedures for such an emergency: no contracts in the till, no guidelines for what to do when water tanks lose pressure and no electronic map of the water system.</p>
<p>“Literally, we had people walking down the street to figure out where a valve was,” Blaine said. “None of those emergency-preparation pieces had been in place, and the fact that we had to improvise all of that was a huge challenge.”</p>
<p>Councilman Priester finds that Jackson is almost always in a state of emergency because of problems the last several administrations have had to deal with: stagnant or declining revenue, flat population growth, a federal consent decree.</p>
<p>“It’s just tough because things get kicked down the road proverbially because we don’t have money to deal with it,” Priester said in an interview. “I think the vision that the Lumumba administration, and particularly Dr. Blaine, have tried to craft is: Let’s use technology to change our processes, and, let’s actually make the investment necessary to do that with our limited resources.”</p>
<p>Now, Blaine and Miller are working on plans that include GIS mapping to get rid of the City’s reliance on paper maps. Also, Miller finally got the council to agree to keep contractors on retainer, especially with the crisis the City’s water and sewer system faces now. The administration has few in-house resources to tackle sewer-system failures and nearly 100 water-system breaks and leaks as of mid-June.</p>
<p>Miller had gone back to the drawing board a few times to tweak the contingency contracts to make the council more comfortable with the dollar amount and equal business opportunity requirements.</p>
<p>But, this time was dire: the EPA was watching. The mayor told the council that the administration would have to report the council’s decision about fixing the sewers to the EPA just two days after the meeting. So, he and Miller presented these contracts as an emergency item.</p>
<p>Aaron Banks of Ward 6 made it clear he would vote against this item because he wanted not only the EPA requirements in writing, but a list of projects the contractors would tackle. This forced a second council meeting the next day because emergency items require unanimous votes to pass. Miller provided the council a list then, and the item passed unanimously.</p>
<p>However, the delay worried the EPA. The mayor expects a warning letter from the U.S. Department of Justice.</p>
<p>In April, Miller and Blaine had a six-hour-long meeting with the regional EPA office in Atlanta about the consent decree. Blaine said the interaction was intense, but in the end, he said the EPA took Miller’s plan for how to deal with the federal regulations “word for word,” only asking that he include a timeline.</p>
<p>Blaine says the ultimate goal is to renegotiate a consent decree because the one on the table is far too expensive for Jackson.</p>
<p>In the face of the winter-water crisis, Miller had to delay tackling the Siemens Inc. water-meter issues. But, in late April he presented a contract “scope swap” to the council that uses $1.1 million already in the contract to pay Siemens’ contractors to fix the billing system by September and start collecting anywhere from $10 million to $20 million in revenue that the City failed to recoup in Miller’s tenure alone. Then, Miller wants them gone.</p>

<p>Nearly 20,000 customers got water to their homes without paying for it because they were “stranded in the system,” so if they did get a bill, it could be thousands of dollars because the meter readings have been arbitrary.</p>
<p>As of the first week of July, 9,000 customers have been billed for more than $8 million, and half those customers have begun making progress payments amounting to more than $900,000 in cash so far. Miller estimates that the City is halfway through the needed work, and the project is moving like clockwork, he says. To gauge that accurately, the council agreed to bring in West Monroe Partners, LLC, of Chicago to ensure Siemens is in full compliance in executing this contract amendment.</p>
<p>Priester said Miller and Blaine impress him, but he finds the administration organized in some parts, and imbalanced in others. The councilman related this year to a game of Jenga. In order to not collapse everything, the administration has had to be careful. But, to keep the pace of the game going, officials also have to get over what Priester calls “decision paralysis” and make crucial choices, while also keeping in mind how the pieces rely on each other.</p>
<p>Like a Jenga tower after a few rounds, there are holes in the administration, and the longer you stay in the game, the harder it gets.</p>
<p>“I think that the challenges that they actually found were different than the challenges that they expected to find,” Priester said. “That’s why we find ourselves a year into our administration, and we still don’t have a police chief.”</p>
<p>People-Oriented Policing</p>
<p>Following his morning duties at City Hall on June 5, the mayor got into the passenger’s seat of a black SUV, and his driver Hondo took him to Pearl’s Southern Cooking in south Jackson. Lumumba’s phone connected via Bluetooth with the car’s radio system and he scrolled through his music library looking for the right song.</p>
<p>North Carolina native J. Cole is the mayor’s favorite, but he afforded this superlative with a caveat: he doesn’t always like to listen to “conscious music.” He went through Drake’s new album “Scorpion” and listed his favorite songs; “Blue Tint” was among them.</p>
<p>Hondo whips through Jackson’s streets as though he is trying to set a record. Another car with the rest of the mayor’s security detail trailed closely, and the men communicated via walkie-talkie the entire route, joking about who will miss the exit this time. Whether the mayor is out to dinner with his wife or at a city council meeting, you will never see him without some combination of the protective tetrad.</p>
<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba had lunch at Pearl’s Southern Cooking in south Jackson on July 5, 2018. He finished his meal with peach cobbler.</p>
<p>Inside the restaurant, the men dished heaps of macaroni and cheese, yams, smothered and fried chicken, lima beans, green beans, turnip greens and various baked breads onto their plates.</p>
<p>As Hondo ate chicken and piled up the bones on a separate plate, the other men around the table joked about his age. Hondo went to Alcorn State University in the 1970s, and the men around the table wondered if he had used a horse and buggy to get back to Jackson. They erupted into laughter at each new joke, egging each other on, making the stakes higher for the next punchline.</p>
<p>“You see how they do me?” Hondo asked rhetorically in his raspy voice that always gives the impression he needs to clear his throat. “Write this stuff down.”</p>
<p>He laughed too, though, flashing a single capped tooth.</p>
<p>However, things have not been as jovial with the capital city’s protection arm, which still does not have a permanent leader. The mayor does not want to rush his decision on a permanent police chief, which he sees as the most critical one he faces, especially when he did not expect to have to do so.</p>
<p>“When I first came in office, my anticipation was that I had my chief—he was already there,” Lumumba said of now-retired Lee Vance, who left the post in December 2017 with rumors of differences of philosophy with the mayor.</p>
<p>Lumumba brought in Anthony Moore as the first interim chief in January. He was difficult to schedule interviews with and elusive at press conferences, where he often hesitated to step up to the podium. Although Moore brought a promising resume with an academic background in criminal justice and 34 years on the force, it is unclear if he will remain with the force in the future.</p>
<p>“I appreciate the service of Chief Moore, and as we have elevated all of the factors to be considered, there was a need to go in a different direction,” the mayor told the JFP. “That doesn’t mean that his efforts weren’t sincere, that doesn’t mean that he didn’t provide valuable contribution to our City.”</p>
<p>The new interim chief, James Davis, appointed June 28, is in many ways the antithesis to Moore, at least personality-wise. The mayor likes that Davis has a significant presence in the community.</p>
<p>Still no permanent Police Chief @JacksonMSPolice. Mayor Lumumba announced Assistant Chief James Davis to serve as Interim Chief as City begins a permanent search. The outgoing Interim Chief, Anthony Moore, was not at the press conference, and it’s not clear if he’ll remain w/ JPD <a href="http://pic.twitter.com/4wx5JkCNYy">pic.twitter.com/4wx5JkCNYy</a></p>
<p>— ko “that’s it” bragg. (@keaux_) June 28, 2018</p>
<p>“He is a people person, and I think that we need to see that out of our police chief—we need to see someone that people feel warmly towards, they’re encouraged to talk to, communicate with,” Lumumba said of Interim Chief Davis.</p>
<p>Although Lumumba will also look nationwide for chief options, he says this is the season for Davis to prove himself.</p>
<p>Davis inherits a police department bound for change. The understaffed department is working on a new recruit class. At the same time, a mayoral-appointed task force, chaired by his friend and former law partner CJ Lawrence, wrestles with how the City will handle officer-involved shootings and the timeframe in which officers’ names would be released, if at all. The task force has been meeting bi-weekly since April, and has yet to make a decision—the mayor says he eagerly awaits the recommendation, and Omari thinks it is taking too long. The task force members set an August deadline to wrap up and provide recommendations.</p>
<p>Tetrina Blalock lost her cousin Lee Edward Bonner in February when two officers, Roy Dickerson and Warren Hull, shot him over a dozen times behind an abandoned house following a narcotics pursuit near Jackson State University.</p>
<p>“I want officers names released,” Blalock told the Jackson Free Press in March. “It’s amazing to me that (they’ll) release the name of a victim, but you won’t release the name of the officer.”</p>
<p>Dickerson and Hull were not indicted, an April Hinds County grand jury no-bill list shows. Her family is not the only one without answers. Two JPD officers, Rakasha Adams and Albert Taylor, shot and killed Crystalline Barnes, 21, following a traffic stop in January. A grand jury didn’t indict them either.</p>
<p>A high-profile Baltimore lawyer hosted an impromptu press conference on the lawn outside of City Hall in May demanding the same thing Tetrina wanted in her cousin’s case: names and transparency.</p>
<p>“It’s so many names swept up under that rug of fatal police shootings, that rug has now become a mountain,” Blalock said in March.</p>
<p>Lumumba says he personally believes in releasing names following officer-involved shootings, and he intended to make the nationally recommended 72-hour name release Jackson’s practice as well, so long as there was no credible threat to officer’s safety. Omari and Blaine had gone over to JPD headquarters to discuss this policy in the spring, but it didn’t go well.</p>
<p>“It was met with 100-percent disagreement from the police department,” Omari said in her office. “… The question that I raised in that initial meeting was, ‘If 72 hours doesn’t give you enough time, how much time do you need?’ And they couldn’t answer that question.”</p>
<p>To Omari, it was not a question of releasing names or not, but rather when?</p>
<p>Within hours of that meeting, the Jackson Police Department organized a meeting at headquarters on March 27 for citizens to stand in solidarity with them, in hopes that they would go speak at the council meeting later that night. Only one woman did.</p>
<p>In a April Jackson Free Press opinion piece titled, “The Mayor’s Task Farce,” criminal-defense attorney Adofo Minka wrote, “(Mayor Lumumba) could have issued an executive order mandating the names of officers involved in violence against civilians be released without the smoke screen of a task force.”</p>
<p>The officer-ID task force was a compromise with JPD, and also a way for Lumumba to implement the people-first political style he learned from his father. He finds criticism that he chose a bureaucratic approach to be “unfounded.”</p>
<p>“If I am going to submit to a people process, then that means I have to even live by it even when it does not necessarily reflect my personal principles and beliefs,” he said. “… The higher principle that I’m going to engage on people has to win out.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the City is well on track to outpace last year’s 64 homicides with 54 at press time with nearly a half-year left. At least three of those stem from officer-involved shootings. Often, crimes such as homicide take place among familial groups of people, but the local news’ nightly array of mugshots can heighten the perception that Jackson is a war zone. The mayor says whether or not people are statistically more likely to be hurt is not the point.</p>
<p>“If you don’t feel safe it’s a problem—it’s as big of a problem as the reality or the perception is,” the mayor said.</p>
<p>Lumumba talked about an alternative reality: violence-interrupter training to make an impact where police aren’t or don’t need to be—homes and nuclear communities. He brought a violence-prevention leader from New York City in June to assess the city’s potential to create a force of interrupters—typically former criminals who are trained to mentor and “interrupt” violence with direct interaction with high-risk young people.</p>

<p>The mayor’s sister, Rukia Lumumba, hosted a people’s assembly on crime that same week. But no specifics have emerged from the efforts to date. Lumumba knows such programs require the f-word—funding.</p>
<p>“As radical as I want to be, if I don’t have the money to achieve any of this, then it really ties my hands,” the mayor said.</p>
<p>‘Larger than Life’</p>
<p>A lot can change in a year, but a lot of things stay the same in a full revolution around the sun. This first year in the “Antar Era” has been a reactionary one.</p>
<p>Blaine’s hope is to become an intelligent city by using data through OpenGov for instance, instead of continuing on this path of anecdotal decision making.</p>
<p>“When you can be predictive, then you can actually determine your preferred future,” Blaine said. &quot;In any other scenario, you are actually waiting for the future to happen and reacting to it.</p>
<p>Mayor Lumumba (right) talks to CAO Robert Blaine in City Hall on July 5, 2018, as his driver Ervin “Hondo” Bradley (center) looks on after a meeting about the “One Lake” development and flood-control project.</p>
<p>Data and technology become especially important for hiring: a process the City still does by having people physically take applications across the City to get signatures. A consulting firm is looking into digitizing this process now through an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.</p>
<p>One of those recent hires is Candice Cole, the city’s new communication manager and a former reporter for WJTV, who returned to Jackson from Washington D.C. to take over the job after a rocky first year for that department.</p>
<p>Her first few weeks in the role brought small, but notable changes, such as press releases following press conferences that come in the body of the email instead of always as a PDF. She responds quickly to media requests, and her helpful attitude goes a long way toward being able to document important stories at home.</p>
<p>“Bringing on Candice Cole is a huge step for us. To be able to have someone that is a professional in communications will help to tell the story of how Jackson is actually transforming,” Blaine said in an interview in his office.</p>
<p>Another critical hire is Michelle L. Thomas, the City’s new financial consultant who is helping Blaine balance the added role of Interim Director of Finance. She comes to Jackson in the midst of an audit and just ahead of budget season with a track record of getting municipal finances in order, including in Newark, N.J.</p>
<p>The man who promised to make Jackson the most radical city in the world has seen perhaps one of the most tangible changes in his own home. He and Ebony welcomed their second daughter in March. And as the first family watches their girls grow, Ebony said she has seen her husband do the same.</p>
<p>“He has grown in many ways … I see characteristics that were already there, they’ve just been sharpened or honed in this position,” Ebony said.</p>
<p>Ebony finds her husband more comfortable with how deep his feelings for people run into the work he does, as he sets the tone for Mississippi’s capital city, but also for his young girls.</p>
<p>Their oldest daughter, Alaké, had been asking who her mother was talking to on the phone initially during the interview, but by the end of the conversation, she had dozed off. Ebony isn’t sure the 4-year-old quite knows what her father’s job is, but the only reality she knows is one where her dad’s face is plastered on signs and commercials. Not too far off, one can imagine, from how her grandfather’s prominence shaped the mayor’s life.</p>
<p>“This is perfectly normal for her,” Ebony said. “She’s probably the only one who feels that way. … She has big expectations for her dad. I think that comes because in her little world, he’s always been a little larger than life.”</p>

<p>District 22 has been represented since January 2004 by Republican Sen. Eugene “Buck” Clarke of Hollandale, who is white and is chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. Photo by Imani Khayyam.</p>
<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — A state Senate district in Mississippi dilutes black voting power and should be redrawn, three African-American plaintiffs say in a federal lawsuit filed Monday.</p>
<p>The suit asks a judge to order legislators to reconfigure the district before the 2019 state elections.</p>
<p>District 22 has a 51 percent black voting-age population, and the suit says it lacks “real electoral opportunity” for African-Americans.</p>
<p>“The lack of opportunity is the result of white bloc voting and lower African-American turnout that are vestiges of the historical discrimination and extreme socio-economic disparities that have been inflicted upon African-Americans over a long period of time,” the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>The district has been represented since January 2004 by Republican Sen. Eugene “Buck” Clarke of Hollandale, who is white and is chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee.</p>
<p>The district is more than 100 miles (161 kilometers) long, stretching through parts of six counties — Bolivar, Humphreys, Sharkey, Washington, Yazoo and Madison. It goes from the impoverished Delta flatlands down into the affluent Jackson suburbs.</p>
<p>Clarke said Monday that he had not read the lawsuit, but all of Mississippi’s legislative districts were approved in 2012 by the Justice Department under then-President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>“Here’s the problem: The Delta’s losing population,” Clarke told The Associated Press on Monday.</p>
<p>He said changing one legislative district would affect others around it.</p>
<p>“You can’t just move one little line somewhere,” said Clarke, who has not decided whether he will seek re-election in 2019.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says District 22 could be redrawn to have about a 60 percent black voting age population, and “one or two adjacent districts” would have to be changed.</p>
<p>Mississippi’s population is nearly 38 percent black. The lawsuit says the state’s voting age population is at least 35 percent black, while African-Americans hold 25 percent of seats in the state Senate — 13 seats of 52.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says no African-American candidate has been elected to the Mississippi Senate in a district with a 51 percent black voting age population. One current African-American senator is from a district with a 55 percent black population, while all others are from districts that are at least 61 percent black, the suit says.</p>
<p>One plaintiff is Joseph Thomas of Yazoo City, who served in the state Senate from 2004 to 2008 in a district adjoining Clarke’s. More of Yazoo County was added to Clarke’s district after the 2010 Census, and Thomas ran against Clarke in 2015. Clarke won with nearly 54 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant on Friday named an attorney who leads a conservative legal group to be the new state auditor.</p>
<p>Shad White, 32, has been Mississippi Justice Institute director since December. He has also been involved in Republican politics for years, including working as a policy adviser in 2011 for then-Lt. Gov. Bryant and running Bryant’s campaign for a second term as governor in 2015.</p>
<p>“He is uniquely prepared for this job,” Bryant said during a news conference at the Governor’s Mansion.</p>
<p>White has never held elected office, although Bryant said he will help White campaign for a full four-year term in 2019.</p>
<p>White succeeds Republican Stacey Pickering, a former state senator from Jones County who has been auditor since 2008 and is resigning the $90,000-a-year job July 16 to take a $122,500-a-year job as director of the Mississippi Veterans Affairs Board.</p>
<p>White will serve the rest of the current four-year auditor’s term, which ends in January 2020.</p>
<p>“I’m going to work myself to the bone to make sure that Mississippi is as free from corruption as we can possibly get,” White said. “I promise you that. I promise you that I will always tell you the truth, even if it is not fun, even if it makes some people uncomfortable, even if it makes some people who are politically powerful uncomfortable. I don’t care.”</p>
<p>White earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Mississippi, and was then a Rhodes scholar, earning a master’s degree in economic history from Oxford University. He later earned a law degree from Harvard. He also holds a certificate in forensic accounting, which is used to detect fraud, from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.</p>
<p>White and his wife, Rina, live in Rankin County. He grew up in the Jones County town of Sandersville, where his mother has been a teacher and his father still works in oil fields. His father is a former alderman and is now mayor in the town of about 730.</p>
<p>White said Friday that he grew up watching his father come home from work, wash the dirt off his face, eat dinner and then go to city hall.</p>
<p>“He told me that the reason he does that is because that’s what good men and women do for their communities. They serve the public,” White said.</p>
<p>Bryant himself was appointed auditor in 1996 and served nearly 12 years. Republican Gov. Kirk Fordice chose him for the job when a Democrat, Steve Patterson, resigned after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of using a false affidavit to buy a car tag. Bryant was auditor until becoming lieutenant governor in 2008.</p>
<p>Bryant made the announcement about White on Friday in the same spot in the Governor’s Mansion where Fordice announced a generation ago that Bryant would be auditor.</p>

<h2><a class="State_Argues_Against_Receivership_for_Mississippi_Foster_Care_10460"></a>State Argues Against Receivership for Mississippi Foster Care</h2>

<p>The State of Mississippi claims the quality of foster care is improving here despite a legal filing saying it is still not complying with court-ordered regulations. A federal judge set requirements for the State as part of the “Olivia Y” lawsuit.</p>
<p>As the Jackson Free Press previously reported, the State agreed to require 90 percent of caseworkers to meet their caseloads, which means staff cannot work with more than a certain number of children. In December, Mississippi Department of Child Protective Services reached 61 percent, but in May, it regressed to 52 percent.</p>
<p>The lawyers representing the children filed a motion in late May asking U.S. District Judge Tom Lee to hold the State in contempt of court and to turn over the system to a court-appointed receiver who would run the foster care system.</p>
<p>The motion, from July 3, fights the request for receivership. The State argues that even if the foster-care system is in contempt of court, receivership is too drastic of a step, because the agency has tried to comply with the agreement.</p>
<p>Mississippi Department of Child Protective Services faced an unplanned budget shortage for the 2018 fiscal year and will face another deficit for the 2019 fiscal year. Since the shortages are not the fault of the foster-care system, they are not responsible for failing to meet caseloads, the State argued in the motion.</p>
<p>On July 3, the department filed another motion to dismiss the caseload requirements. The motion says it made the necessary requests for funding to hit the 90-percent caseload requirement, but it did not receive adequate funding and, thus, the court should not hold the State responsible.</p>
<p>Olivia Y lawyers have until July 20 to file a response. Mississippi would be the second system in the United States to face receivership. Washington, D.C., was the other; receivership there ended in 2001.</p>

<h2><a class="OPINION_The_End_of_the_Eastland_Machine_10488"></a>OPINION: The End of the Eastland Machine</h2>

<p>The late Brad Dye, Mississippi lieutenant governor from 1980 to 1992 after stints as state treasurer, other offices and in 1954, was a driver for U.S. Sen. James O. Eastland (pictured) during his re-election campaign. Photo by Public Domain</p>
<p>OXFORD—A politician friend came up to me at a restaurant the other day, shook his head slowly, and said in hushed tones, “Well, that’s the end of the Eastland Machine.”</p>
<p>He was referring to the passing of Brad Dye, Mississippi lieutenant governor from 1980 to 1992 after stints as state treasurer, other offices and in 1954, a driver for U.S. Sen. James O. Eastland during his re-election campaign.</p>
<p>Like his mentor, Eastland, whose long stretch of power included a statewide network of lieutenants, cronies, operatives and ward-heelers who could make or break an upcoming politician’s career, Dye came out of a different era—one with some striking contrasts to today’s politics.</p>
<p>As a much younger columnist who’d covered the state Legislature in the early 1980s, I once described Dye as “King Brad,” then the state’s most powerful politician who ruled from his perch in the state Senate, and decided whether missives from the House or even the Governor’s Mansion deserved attention.</p>
<p>I guess I’m getting old, but I look back at Dye’s reign with a hint of nostalgia these days. Cut from the Eastland mold, he was a conservative Democrat back when Republicans were what his mentor called a “zero” who offered voters “mighty dern little.” Still, Dye supported Gov. William Winter’s landmark education reform package in 1982, the highway expansion program of 1987 and decent funding for the state’s universities.</p>
<p>Dye lost power when Republicans began taking over the state’s reins in 1991—ironically the same year I called him “King Brad”—and that transition has proven Eastland’s words to be prophetic as well as true when he said them. Mississippi voters still get “mighty dern little” from Republicans, other than an occasion to rail against liberals, minorities and immigrants.</p>
<p>Sure, politicians often took their cues from Eastland in Washington, D.C., like Dye early in his career, but at least Eastland was a Mississippian with a constant eye on Mississippi; mind you, back then it was not a good thing if you were African American. Perhaps that’s why Eastland finally seemed to soften in his last years, befriending civil-rights leader Aaron Henry, accepting the reality of civil-rights gains and making his office more responsive to the concerns of black citizens in his state.</p>
<p>Today, the state’s Republican rulers take their cues from powerful ideological forces far beyond Mississippi with no non-political interest in the state or its people.</p>
<p>Gov. Phil Bryant, a charter member of the FOD (Friends of Donald) club, sends Mississippi National Guardsmen to the Texas-Mexico border in support of President Donald Trump’s immoral immigration policies. Bryant recently withdrew support for a $70 million three-state plan involving Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama that would have restored Amtrak passenger rail service from New Orleans through the Mississippi Gulf Coast to Mobile, Ala. The states would have split the cost with the federal government.</p>
<p>These days the billionaire Wichita, Kan., and New York City-based Koch brothers, their Americans for Prosperity organization, and the archconservative American Legislative Exchange Council call the shots for Republican politicians across the country, including Mississippi. The Koch brothers, rich with oil holdings and major producers of gasoline, asphalt, tires and seatbelts, don’t like public transit, and they recently helped kill a much-needed $5.4 billion mass-transit plan in Nashville, Tenn. Trump wants to slash Amtrak funding, something the Koch brothers would applaud.</p>
<p>Oh, well, enough nostalgia. In reality, machine politics still rule in Mississippi. It’s just that this go-round, Mississippi’s politicians only take orders—they don’t give them.</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO (AP) — The American Civil Liberties Union said it appears the Trump administration will miss a court-ordered deadline to reunite young children who were separated at the border with their parents in more than half of the cases.</p>
<p>The ACLU said late Sunday the administration provided it with a list of 102 children under 5 years old and that “appears likely that less than half will be reunited” by Tuesday’s deadline.</p>
<p>The Justice Department asked U.S. District Judge Dana Sabraw for more time last week but the judge on Friday did not grant a blanket extension, saying only that he would consider certain exceptions. He told the two sides to discuss possible exceptions and report to him Monday. The Justice Department was working through the weekend on a path toward unification and was preparing a progress report for the court.</p>
<p>Children were increasingly separated from their parents after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in May that a zero-tolerance policy on illegally entering the country was in full effect. While parents were criminally prosecuted, children were placed in custody of the Health and Human Services Department.</p>
<p>Trump reversed course on June 20 amid an international outcry and said families should remain together.</p>
<p>On June 26, Sabraw set deadlines of Tuesday to reunite children under 5 with their families and July 26 for older children. Sabraw, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, wrote that the “situation has reached a crisis level” and that the “chaotic circumstances” were of the government’s own making.</p>
<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Thursday there were “under 3,000” children separated from their parents. Previously, he said 2,047.</p>
<p>“It’s extremely disappointing that the Trump administration looks like it will fail to reunite even half the children under 5 with their parent,” said ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt. “These kids have already suffered so much because of this policy, and every extra day apart just adds to that pain.”</p>
<p>The ACLU sued in March on behalf of a Congolese woman who was separated from her daughter for five months after seeking asylum at a San Diego border crossing and a Brazilian asylum-seeker who was separated from her son after an arrest for illegal entry in August near the Texas-New Mexico border.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (AP) — A protest against U.S. immigration policy forced the evacuation of the Statue of Liberty on the Fourth of July, with a group unfurling a banner from the pedestal and a woman holding police at bay for hours after she climbed the base and sat by the statue’s robes.</p>
<p>The woman and at least a half-dozen demonstrators who displayed the banner were arrested, while the climb forced thousands of visitors to leave the iconic American symbol on the nation’s birthday.</p>
<p>About 100 feet (30 meters) aboveground, the woman engaged in a four-hour standoff with police before two officers climbed up to the base and went over to her. With the dramatic scene unfolding on live television, she and the officers edged carefully around the statue toward a ladder, and she climbed down about 25 feet (8 meters) to the monument’s observation point and was taken into custody.</p>
<p>The woman, Therese Okoumou, told police she was protesting the separation of immigrant children from parents who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally, according to a federal official who was briefed on what happened but wasn’t authorized to discuss it and spoke on the condition of anonymity. A message left at a possible phone number for Okoumou wasn’t immediately returned.</p>
<p>The climber was among about 40 demonstrators who earlier unfurled a banner calling for abolishing the federal government’s chief immigration enforcement agency, said Jay W. Walker, an organizer with Rise and Resist, which arranged the demonstration.</p>
<p>Walker said the other demonstrators had no idea the woman would make the ascent, which wasn’t part of the planned protest.</p>
<p>“We don’t know whether she had this planned before she ever got to Liberty Island or whether it was a spur-of-the-moment decision,” Walker said.</p>
<p>Regardless, he said he felt the publicity would help the group’s cause.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the National Park Service, which runs the monument, saw it differently.</p>
<p>“I feel really sorry for those visitors today” who had to leave or couldn’t come, spokesman Jerry Willis said. “People have the right to speak out. I don’t think they have the right to co-opt the Statue of Liberty to do it.”</p>
<p>The climber ascended from the observation point, Willis said. Visitors were forced to leave Liberty Island hours before its normal 6:15 p.m. closing time, he said.</p>
<p>Earlier and farther below, at least six people were taken into custody after unfurling a banner that read “Abolish I.C.E.,” referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, whose officers arrest and deport immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, among other duties.</p>
<p>Willis said federal regulations prohibit hanging banners from the monument.</p>
<p>Rise and Resist opposes President Donald Trump’s administration and advocates ending deportations and family separations at the border.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has said the president’s immigration policy is a step forward for public safety.</p>
<p>Under Trump’s zero-tolerance policy, the government has begun requiring border agents to arrest and prosecute anyone caught entering the country illegally. That resulted in more than 2,000 children being separated from their parents within six weeks this spring.</p>
<p>Under public pressure, Trump later halted his policy of taking children from their detained parents. A federal judge in California ordered the Trump administration late last month to reunite the more than 2,000 children with their parents in 30 days.</p>
<p>“Abolish ICE” has become a rallying cry at protests around the country and for some Democratic officeholders seeking to boost their progressive credentials. But Trump, a Republican, said on Twitter last week that abolishing ICE will “never happen!”</p>
<p>The Statue of Liberty has long been a welcoming symbol for immigrants and refugees coming to the U.S. It also has been a setting for protests and other actions that forced evacuations.</p>
<p>Last February, someone hung a banner reading “Refugees Welcome” from the observation deck. The sign was taken down about an hour after being discovered.</p>
<p>A year earlier, a West Virginia man was sentenced to time served after calling in a bomb threat that forced the evacuation of Liberty Island, sending 3,200 people on boats back to lower Manhattan and New Jersey.</p>
<p>In 2000, 12 people protesting the Navy’s use of the Puerto Rican Island of Vieques for bombing exercises were arrested after a man climbed out on the spires of the statue’s crown and attached flags and banners to it.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — This spring, the Trump administration began a “zero tolerance” policy to criminally prosecute anyone caught crossing the border illegally. Because children can’t be in jail with their parents, more than 2,300 families caught by Border Patrol were separated. The move prompted mass outrage in the United States and internationally. After first blaming the practice on the Democrats, Trump on June 20 signed an executive order that stopped the separation of families. A June 26 court order by a federal judge set a hard deadline to reunite the families, and that deadline is fast approaching.</p>
<p>Here’s where things stand:</p>
<p>THE NUMBERS</p>
<p>It’s still not clear how many children have been separated from families under the zero-tolerance policy, or how many remain separated. Trump administration officials have said 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 parents between May 5 through June 9. Trump’s order stopped separations on June 20.</p>
<p>About 520 children were reunited with their families within days because the improper-entry prosecutions were finished before the minors were turned over to the custody of Health and Human Services, which is responsible for caring for unaccompanied children. HHS Secretary Alex Azar told a congressional committee on June 26 there were 2,047 such children in his agency’s care.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he said there are somewhere “under 3,000” children who were believed to have been separated, but that includes kids who may have lost parents along the journey, not just parents who were detained at the border. He said none had been transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody yet.</p>
<p>REUNITING FAMILIES</p>
<p>A federal judge in San Diego who had been hearing the case of a woman separated from her child ruled on June 26 that the families must be reunited within 30 days of his order, and by July 10 if the children are younger than 5.</p>
<p>But it’s still not clear yet how that will work. Homeland Security has set up a staging area at the Port Isabel detention center in Texas where the parents can be detained until their children arrive. But it’s not clear where they will go afterward — the three operational family detention centers are near capacity.</p>
<p>It’s also possible not all parents will be reunited with their children; HHS has a strict set of guidelines the agency must follow to determine a suitable sponsor, including a home visit and a criminal background check.</p>
<p>Health and Human Services deployed more than 200 workers to review the cases of separated children. Azar said parents and children are being swabbed for DNA to match paternity and checks are being done as rapidly as possible to make the court deadline. He suggested the children would be transferred to ICE custody at Port Isabel shortly before the deadline. But he signaled they’d ask a judge for more time.</p>
<p>Azar said about 100 of the separated children are younger than 5 and subject to the rapidly approaching July 10 deadline. Officials there say they know the locations of all the children — some were sent hundreds of miles away to shelters around the country operated by nonprofits that care for them until a parent or other sponsor is identified.</p>
<p>A court hearing was scheduled Friday.</p>
<p>FAMILY DETENTION</p>
<p>It’s also unclear if the families, once reunited, will be detained together or released on bond to wait out their cases. Trump administration officials have signaled they want to detain families indefinitely if they cross the border illegally, regardless of whether they are claiming asylum, in part because they say the cases move much quicker. But a court agreement on how children are treated in immigration custody generally prevents the government from holding children in detention longer than 20 days.</p>
<p>Justice Department officials have asked that the agreement, known as the Flores agreement, be modified to allow for longer detentions. Homeland Security requested up to 12,000 more beds for a family detention center at a military base, though it asked for 2,000 to be made available quickly and the rest as needed.</p>
<p>The facilities would have to comply with the standards set by the agreement that governs how children are treated in custody, which include access to medical care, entertainment, counseling and air conditioning; though many who have been detained say the accommodations still feel like prison. Congress would have to approve funding to operate the facility.</p>
<p>ASYLUM</p>
<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who oversees immigration courts, has narrowed the parameters for those seeking asylum, arguing that domestic violence or gang violence is not grounds to grant it — a blow to people arriving from Central American countries like El Salvador that have been ravaged by violent street gangs.</p>
<p>Despite the limits, Homeland Security officials say if someone comes to a port of entry legally and claims asylum, then they won’t face criminal prosecution for improper entry. They generally aren’t detained while their cases are heard. Administration officials say only about 20 percent of asylum claims are granted, though people often spend years exhausting appeals before they are deported.</p>
<p>Some asylum seekers have been turned away at border crossings. Administration officials said it was a temporary measure only to free up space in processing centers. They say that the migrants were told to come back and that it was not an effort to push them into illegally crossing between borders, where they would be more likely to be detained and face criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>ZERO TOLERNACE</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the zero-tolerance policy remains in effect for those who illegally cross the border alone: About half of the illegal crossings are single adults.</p>
<p>The charge of improper entry is a misdemeanor and the practice is usually for those caught to plead guilty and be sentenced to time served, or a brief jail sentence.</p>
<p>Right now, adults who arrive with children are no longer being referred for prosecution because there is not enough space to detain families together. It’s unclear if or whether families will again face criminal prosecution should space become available.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant on Friday named an attorney who leads a conservative legal group to be the new state auditor.</p>
<p>Shad White, 32, has been Mississippi Justice Institute director since December. He has also been involved in Republican politics for years, including working as a policy adviser in 2011 for then-Lt. Gov. Bryant and running Bryant’s campaign for a second term as governor in 2015.</p>
<p>“He is uniquely prepared for this job,” Bryant said during a news conference at the Governor’s Mansion.</p>
<p>White has never held elected office, although Bryant said he will help White campaign for a full four-year term in 2019.</p>
<p>White succeeds Republican Stacey Pickering, a former state senator from Jones County who has been auditor since 2008 and is resigning the $90,000-a-year job July 16 to take a $122,500-a-year job as director of the Mississippi Veterans Affairs Board.</p>
<p>White will serve the rest of the current four-year auditor’s term, which ends in January 2020.</p>
<p>“I’m going to work myself to the bone to make sure that Mississippi is as free from corruption as we can possibly get,” White said. “I promise you that. I promise you that I will always tell you the truth, even if it is not fun, even if it makes some people uncomfortable, even if it makes some people who are politically powerful uncomfortable. I don’t care.”</p>
<p>White earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Mississippi, and was then a Rhodes scholar, earning a master’s degree in economic history from Oxford University. He later earned a law degree from Harvard. He also holds a certificate in forensic accounting, which is used to detect fraud, from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.</p>
<p>White and his wife, Rina, live in Rankin County. He grew up in the Jones County town of Sandersville, where his mother has been a teacher and his father still works in oil fields. His father is a former alderman and is now mayor in the town of about 730.</p>
<p>White said Friday that he grew up watching his father come home from work, wash the dirt off his face, eat dinner and then go to city hall.</p>
<p>“He told me that the reason he does that is because that’s what good men and women do for their communities. They serve the public,” White said.</p>
<p>Bryant himself was appointed auditor in 1996 and served nearly 12 years. Republican Gov. Kirk Fordice chose him for the job when a Democrat, Steve Patterson, resigned after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of using a false affidavit to buy a car tag. Bryant was auditor until becoming lieutenant governor in 2008.</p>
<p>Bryant made the announcement about White on Friday in the same spot in the Governor’s Mansion where Fordice announced a generation ago that Bryant would be auditor.</p>

<p>“The delusion of freedom is far more dangerous,</p>
<p>Than any jail cell or cramped cages” —<a href="http://G.Be">G.Be</a></p>
<p>Genesis Be Photo courtesy Mickey Lewitter</p>
<p>This week we celebrate our nation’s independence. Gladly, I partake in viewing the brilliant firework displays and relaxing with a cold brew as smoke from slow-cooked barbecue ribs bellow over my laughing friends and family. In this moment, I celebrate all of the freedoms my ancestors fought to gain, freedoms that I have inherited via the toil, suffering, fighting and victory of my foremothers. I ponder those freedoms that have been denied to women, black, LGBT and poor Americans up until recent history, and freedoms that we are still fighting to obtain.</p>
<p>This day I’m grateful for Jeff Sessions’ absolutely “sane and humane” reasons for separating families at the border, which are, of course, the natural reaction from our brave leadership to keep our freedoms exclusively for Americans. Why should I have to share my hard-earned privileges with immigrants fleeing the same violence and political turmoil that American policy and meddling in South and Central America created?</p>
<p>This is our American Christian way. Our obvious response is to quote the Holy Bible to justify imprisoning toddlers in internment camps, making them susceptible to predators in uniform and forcing them to stand trial alone. What would you expect us to do? We are the land of the free and home of the brave. My white ancestors immigrated to America from Germany and France looking for a better life, too.</p>
<p>I offer a toast to the freedom of speech that allows a group of white college students visiting a city they didn’t grow up in to drive past my friend’s family and yell “Terrorists!,” mistaking them for who-knows-what ethnicity or religion.</p>
<p>I also celebrate the freedom for hate speech to be deemed harmless until it escalates to an actual attack on another human being or their property. I close my eyes and relish in these freedoms as the fireworks begin to illuminate the sky, each exploding with a sound closer to that of gunfire.</p>
<p>In this beautiful moment, I celebrate the bravery of our troops and the powerful military for which America has become known. I bask in the triumph of our acquisition of territories, the extracting of resources and colonization of other brown people across the globe—all of which make my life as an American exceptionally privileged. Another swig of the brew.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s the suds talking now, but I honestly admire our current administration’s ability to roll back civic freedoms while keeping our attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>Truly, what is more of a testament to freedom for Americans than our great leader canceling the phase-out process of private prisons? Surely rich stakeholders profiting off the excessive and disproportionate incarceration of mostly brown and black Americans is indeed a freedom we can all get behind. This has been the American way far before President Donald Trump and his administration; I can’t give him all the credit. They did not create America’s delusion of freedom; they merely mastered it. The delusion is so powerful that anyone who dares to question America’s abundant freedoms granted to all its citizens equally no matter gender, race or religion is immediately told to “leave America if you don’t like it.”</p>
<p>Even those who simply decide to stand up for unarmed black Americans’ right to not be killed by the police are called “un-American” or “agitators,” penalized by our leadership as if the right to due process and trial is not written into our Constitution.</p>
<p>All irony aside, this day, my full gratitude is for those on the front lines fighting against the illusion and folklore of American freedom. I call them brave hearts: those who spend their days at the polls, or on the street marching, or on the phone with their state representative, or speaking their truth despite threats of backlash and physical harm. They understand the actual freedoms we enjoy are often at the expense of others. It doesn’t have to be this way.</p>
<p>These are the few Americans who use their privilege and compassion to physically, civically or legally combat those who seek to impede the freedoms of other humans based on race, religion or country of origin. With more than six million Americans either incarcerated or on probation, or with the threat of prison constantly looming over them, we have to abolish practices and institutions that discriminate against racism, hatred and fear of the “other.”</p>
<p>Millions of Americans live within the confines of crippling addiction, unaffordable health care and generational poverty caused by the same institutions that were made to help them. We have been hijacked. I critique America because I truly love the ideals of which it was based and the freedoms which I have inherited. We cannot sit back while the freedoms we have gained come under assault from those who perpetuate xenophobia and racism for political and capital gain. As Americans, it is our duty to hold up these ideals and make sure that they apply to all of us, not just a chosen few.</p>
<p>I think the ribs are done.</p>

<p>Michael “Pretty Boy Floyd” Wilson, who had eluded authorities for three days after escaping from a Leakesville prison, was captured Saturday night in St. Martin, officials said.</p>
<p>He was taken into custody at about 6 p.m. Earlier in the day, Mississippi Coast Crime Stoppers had offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.</p>
<p>Wilson, 47, escaped from the South Mississippi Correctional Institution in Leakesville on Thursday by climbing a fence, according to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. He was on the lam for 53 hours.</p>
<p>Wilson was taken to the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility near Pearl on Sunday, the MDOC website shows. SMCI in Leakesville had been on lock-down since Wilson’s escape.</p>

<p>Neighbors gave tips that Wilson was in a home on Sunnyside Drive in St. Martin, according to WXXV News 25. The community is in Jackson County just east of D’Iberville and on the south side of Interstate 10.</p>
<p>Officers found Wilson around Sunnyside Drive and Palfrey Road, thanks to tips called in, Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell told WXXV on Monday.</p>
<p>“It was one of numerous calls where people described him and the questions he was asking the person,” Ezell told WXXV.</p>
<p>“He wanted to borrow a T-shirt, he wanted some sunglasses. So, that was a pretty dead giveaway right there.”</p>
<p>A neighbor, Seth Whittington told WXXV he felt better knowing Wilson was captured.</p>
<p>&quot;I just never thought it would have been here, to be honest with you, &quot;Whittington said.</p>
<p>MDOC Commissioner Pelicia E. Hall commended MDOC officers and local, state, county and federal agencies for helping &quot;to get a dangerous felon back into custody without anyone getting hurt.”</p>
<p>Wilson had first been spotted after he asked an elderly woman to give him a ride to Lucedale, George County Sheriff Keith Havard said. Havard the Sun Herald Thursday that Wilson was believed to be heading south toward Jackson County. Later that night, D’Iberville police said they had reason to believe Wilson was in the city.</p>
<p>Wilson is serving two life sentences after a conviction on two counts of murder in 2015 from Harrison County. He was sentenced Sept. 2, 2015. Wilson was convicted in the 2014 murders of Carmen Dale Edwards of Biloxi and Kenneth Gibson of Gulfport. Wilson beat both of them to death.</p>
<p>Wilson also is serving time on five other felony convictions.</p>

<h2><a class="Our_View_MDOT_should_kill_road_project_Investigation_needed_into_Reeves_influence_10876"></a>Our View: MDOT should kill road project. Investigation needed into Reeves’ influence</h2>
<p class="byline">by: Mississippi Clarion Ledger</p>
<p class="date">2018-07-10</p>
<p class="source">url: <a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/opinion/editorials/2018/07/11/mdot-should-kill-road-project-investigation-needed-into-reeves-influence/774637002/">https://www.clarionledger.com/story/opinion/editorials/2018/07/11/mdot-should-kill-road-project-investigation-needed-into-reeves-influence/774637002/</a></p>
<p>MDOT has plans for an additional $2 million frontage road project along Lakeland Drive that will connect Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves’ gated subdivision to Dogwood Festival Market shopping center. The project is a result of an earmark passed by the Legislature. Sarah Warnock and Geoff Pender</p>
<p>The Mississippi Department of Transportation made the right decision to immediately cease an estimated $2 million project to build a road connecting two gated subdivisions to Dogwood Festival Market. It is clear that this road is not needed. It is further clear that the only reason this road is being built is because of pressure from the office of Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and likely the lieutenant governor himself.</p>
<p>Stopping the project is not enough, however. The project to build a road needs to be killed altogether. Furthermore, Reeves’ potential role in this entire affair needs to be determined. MDOT Executive Director Melinda McGrath would not name Reeves directly to the Clarion Ledger as being involved, but her statements to us and records we obtained all point to his involvement.</p>
<p>Someone needs to investigate to see if the lieutenant governor applied undue political pressure to build this road or if any laws were broken. It could be the attorney general, though AG Jim Hood is expected to run for governor next year, the same office Reeves is expected to seek. An investigation by Hood would be colored by politics, fairly or unfairly. Nevertheless, an investigation is in order.</p>
<p>Original story: MDOT: Political pressure driving road connecting Tate Reeves’ subdivision, shopping center</p>
<p>Legislative hearings into this matter would not be out-of-line, either. The House resisted Reeves’ early attempts to push the Highway 25/Lakeland Drive widening ahead of projects equally as deserving, especially at a time when MDOT was struggling to meet maintenance demands of crumbling state infrastructure. Despite the House eventually acquiescing, they have shown more objectivity and pragmatism in dealing with transportation funding matters. They could be trusted to look into this matter by bringing MDOT officials before a special committee to testify about how the $2 million project came about.</p>
<p>It is no secret that Reeves believes MDOT projects should be overseen by a single person. He admitted as much in his so-called plan to address funding needs for road and bridge maintenance. Reeves’ proposal was more about giving the governor’s office control over road projects than it was about fixing dilapidated roads and bridges. And, of course, Reeves is expected to run for governor next year.</p>
<p>Reeves’ proposal and this glorified $2 million private drive fronting Lakeland is smacks of the way supervisors across Mississippi used to shamelessly use road and work crews to curry favor with voters — even going so far as paving private driveways and building better access to privately owned land to increase property values and development opportunities.</p>
<p>Continue reading after gallery</p>
<p>Finally, the person who could clear up everything is Reeves himself. Surely he doesn’t want people to think he is acting like a real-life Mississippi Gov. Pappy O’Daniel (the “O’ Brother, Where Art Thou” version, not the actual former Texas governor). Reeves should submit to an open questioning about this project. If he has done nothing wrong, he would have no problem providing any and all related records — including email and text correspondence — for review.</p>
<p>At the very least, Reeves should publicly say he supports killing — not just halting — the $2 million road project.</p>
<p>“Yes. Political pressure. From the Legislature. We would not have done this otherwise,” McGrath said, eventually specifying the pressure came “from the Senate side.”</p>
<p>Reeves could end any political pressure “from the Senate side” with a single statement.</p>
<p>“I don’t support this project,” is all it would take.</p>
<p>After all, building a $2 million road from Reeves’ gated subdivision to a retail shopping hub is a massive waste of taxpayer money, something Reeves usually says he is against.</p>

<p>U.S. needs to concentrate on better forms of renewable energy</p>
<p>Recently, Energy Secretary Rick Perry unveiled a plan to “preserve” U.S. coal and nuclear plants. Now in the column, “Let’s not get rid of coal power just yet,” J. Winston Porter claims that this plan will save a vital part of power production. However, that is not the case.</p>
<p>First, the plan will cost consumers more as grid operators will be forced to purchase electricity from more coal and nuclear plants when they could buy much cheaper renewable power. The concern driving this policy is the fear that power production will not be diverse without coal and nuclear power. Although these two industries may be declining, the renewable sector can pick up the slack as it has worked on creating an increasingly more diverse stock of electricity from sources such as solar, geothermal, hydro, and wind. The growth that these different sources have seen as a great boon to the economy would be stifled by the secretary’s plan.</p>
<p>Yet the plan is not only detrimental to the consumer’s wallet but also their environment. Coal plants produced 69 percent of emissions in the power sector for 2017 and also stand attributable to increased cases of asthma in the areas around them. These costs are the reason coal plants are fading away even under an administration that is extremely favorable toward them. Instead, the US needs to put money toward developing better storage mechanisms for renewable energy and increasing renewable development, not pushing cash into a failing hazardous industry.</p>

<p>Saluting community journalists everywhere, including here in Jackson</p>
<p>The newspaper that became the Capital Gazette of Annapolis, Maryland, printed the Declaration of Independence shortly after it was written. It did so on the second page. The first page was reserved for reportage on the community it served.</p>
<p>Then, as now, the “who, what, when, where” of the local community was recognized as the sacred duty of journalism without which none of us could be good citizens.</p>
<p>Five journalists working for the Capital Gazette were murdered while doing their job. So, in this patriotic season, let’s celebrate our own Anna Wolfe, Jimmie Gates, Sarah Fowler, Bracey Harris and all of our other local reporters who, with persistence and shoe leather, are the guardians of our community.</p>

<p>Humor is dead in America and that is a tragedy</p>
<p>Humor is now dead in America. It has simply ceased to exist. This is a tragedy of immense proportions yet it has been ignored by pundits in all of the media. Let me present some evidence that supports my position.</p>
<p>Where are the Bob Hopes or Red Skeletons of today? Why is showing us a picture of our president’s bloody and decapitated head suppose to be funny? Is anybody’s funny bone tickled by the call for the president’s 10-year-old son to be kidnapped and turned over to a pedophile? Why don’t today’s late night talk show hosts attract the huge audiences that Johnny Carson enjoyed? When was the last time you tuned in to watch humorless talk show hosts bash the president? Do you wonder why we are supposed to laugh when exposed to obscenities that were once censored?</p>
<p>There are many more examples. You hear new ones every day. If you agree that I have a point ask yourself this question: Can a society without humor continue to exist?</p>

<p>1962, James Meredith became the first known African-American student admitted to the segregated University of Mississippi-only after federal government intervention. Four years later Meredith planned a solo 220-mile March Against Fear through the south. He wanted to highlight racism in the South and encourage voter registration. Now, his renewed and stated final mission is to encourage the African-American church to lead humanity in living the Ten Commandments, thus restoring morality to modern times. Wochit</p>
<p>James Meredith says he has one last mission from God.</p>
<p>“It’s what I’ve believed for a long time but have been too scared to say,” said the 85-year-old civil rights pioneer.</p>
<p>He wants to see a “Race to Heal Church,” he said. “There is nobody who has clarified it better than the queen of England in the last few weeks by her reaction to her grandson marrying a black woman.”</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth supported Prince Harry’s choice of Meghan Markle, whose mother is African American. The couple married in Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>Meredith’s mission is to heal racial divisions through honest dialogue and to foster good moral character in today’s youth.</p>
<p>Meredith’s first mission took place when he became the first known black student at the all-white University of Mississippi in fall 1962.</p>
<p>That mission, he said, was “about breaking the system of white supremacy.”</p>
<p>The second mission came June 5, 1966, when he began what became known as the “March Against Fear.”</p>
<p>On the second day of that one-man walk from Memphis to Jackson, a white man shot him.</p>
<p>Meredith survived. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights activists came to Mississippi to finish the march.</p>
<p>Meredith said this second mission challenged the fear connected to the Southern “way of life” — a fear that affected both black and white Mississippians.</p>
<p>Ironically, it is fear that has kept him from starting his last mission, he said. “Here I am, considered the bravest man in the world, scared to do God’s will.&quot;</p>
<p>Meredith recalls MLK’s ‘Mountaintop’ speech</p>
<p>The night before his April 4, 1968, assassination, King delivered what would be his final speech.</p>
<p>“Like anybody, I would like to live a long life,” he told the crowd. “Longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land!”</p>
<p>Meredith cited this speech, saying he, too, wants to do God’s will.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with taking care of man’s business,” he said, “but when you neglect God’s business, everything falls apart.”</p>
<p>The civil rights pioneer who once said he never made a mistake now admits he has.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, Meredith became so well-known and so respected that NBC named him one of the top six black leaders in the nation.</p>
<p>But he has often defied description since, alternately intelligent and eccentric, brainy and bizarre, a man who graduated from Columbia Law School but never bothered to take the bar exam.</p>
<p>What he thought of himself came through in his book, “Three Years in Mississippi,” in which he opined about his mission to integrate Ole Miss: “I have never made a mistake.”</p>
<p>But as the civil rights legend enters his twilight years, he is showing signs of self-deprecation.</p>
<p>“James Meredith was the son of a poor dirt farmer. That may be who I was, but that’s not who I thought I was,” he said. “James Meredith thought he was the smartest man in the world.”</p>
<p>He said he has recently concluded that he is no better than others.</p>
<p>Meredith says black families are being split every day by the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>Four decades ago, Meredith purchased property in west Jackson to establish a Bible Society Church, he said. “But for 40 years, I told God, ‘You’re wrong. You’re going to get me lynched.’”</p>
<p>He spoke of the outcry regarding children being snatched away from their immigrant parents.</p>
<p>He said that is unfortunately happening every day in the black community — families split not by immigration authorities, but by the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>At one point in sharing his thoughts, he grew silent, finally saying, “boy, that fear is powerful.”</p>
<p>Some preachers are afraid of sharing the truth because “they ain’t about to lose good parishioners,” he said.</p>
<p>“We have been perpetuating a lie and not dealing at all with the truth,” he said. “All Christ has ever required was the truth, but man has always found a way around dealing with it, including old James Meredith.”</p>

<p>Meredith likened to Gary Cooper in ‘High Noon’</p>
<p>Author William Doyle, who co-wrote Meredith’s memoir, likens him to Gary Cooper in “High Noon,” “the quintessential American loner-hero, the guy on a horse who rides into town, puts his life on the line and changes history not once but twice, then rides off into the sunset.”</p>
<p>Now, more than a half-century later, Doyle sees him as perhaps “the most complex and illuminating hero in civil rights history, someone who has glimpsed insights like a biblical prophet. …</p>
<p>“He sees the beginning of a solution to racial issues in America to be a simple one — he wants black and white Americans to be honest about themselves and about each other. These are radical ideas, but they show us a possible path to a better future.”</p>
<p>Beyond his personal heroism, Doyle said, Meredith’s “biggest contribution is to show us the power and potential of American citizenship — to tell the truth about yourself and your country, to admit your mistakes and to change your mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Meredith says God has let him live to carry out this last mission.</p>
<p>On Martin Luther King Day, Meredith toured the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, filled with pictures of the civil rights pioneer.</p>
<p>When two people saw the white-bearded man, they whispered as they pointed at him.</p>
<p>“That’s James Meredith,” one said.</p>
<p>“No,” the other replied, “he’s dead.”</p>
<p>Meredith laughed in recalling the encounter.</p>
<p>Meredith, who underwent surgery for prostate cancer in 1996, said God has let him live long enough to carry out this last mission, pushing to raise society’s moral character.</p>
<p>For the past 40 years, “we’ve been afraid to use the word ‘moral character,’” he said. “We need to be about instilling good and right values in people.”</p>
<p>If the black church takes on this task, he said, “the world will follow.”</p>
<p>Racial reconciliation needed because ‘we’re not hearing each other.’</p>
<p>The Rev. John Perkins of Jackson, who has spoken from middle America to the Middle East, welcomes Meredith’s idea of healing. “That has been my mission in life,” he said.</p>
<p>Racial reconciliation is needed more than ever because society’s messages have devolved into babble — the nation’s political parties, constituencies and cultures all speaking different languages, he said. “We’re not hearing each other.”</p>
<p>His new book, “One Blood,” discusses why more work must take place across racial lines. “We all bleed the same,” and yet some still put race ahead of friendship, he said.</p>
<p>Rather than people seeking to “demonize others,” he said, seek to solve the problems.</p>
<p>He said he differs with Meredith on some of his views but welcomes his call for instilling good values. “There has been a family breakdown,” he said, “and children suffer the most.”</p>
<p>‘God is blaming me for their lives’</p>
<p>Meredith clutched a picture of 6-year-old Kingston Frazier of Jackson, who had been sleeping in the back seat of car before he was killed last year in a carjacking.</p>

<p>Meredith pointed at photographs of several teens charged in connection with the slaying. “My God is blaming me for their lives …”</p>
<p>He moved his finger toward Frazier’s picture. “… the same way he is for this one’s life.”</p>
<p>He said he believes God is telling him, “You didn’t do your job. If you had done your job, if you had taught moral character, right and wrong, good and bad, them boys would have known better, and this boy would still be alive.”</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves talks about controversial state-funded road from his gated neighborhood. Sarah Warnock, Clarion Ledger</p>
<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves said Wednesday he had nothing to do with a push for a state road being built from the entrance of his gated subdivision to a nearby shopping hub and said if there were any inappropriate legislative influence on the project, he wants to know about it and investigate.</p>
<p>Reeves said if his staff communicated with the Mississippi Department of Transportation about the road, it’s because his neighbors or other constituents wanted updates on it, not him. He said his staff routinely inquires about state road projects on behalf of constituents or other elected officials who can’t get information.</p>
<p>He also accused the Clarion Ledger of “creating a story that doesn’t exist” and other media of suffering confusion at best, or practicing “conflagration.”</p>
<p>Reeves said he openly pushed for a project to widen busy Lakeland Drive near where he lives but had no role in or conversations about the final phase of the project, building the road to his neighborhood. It was ostensibly needed for safety after Lakeland was widened to six lanes that neighborhood motorists would have to cross to turn left.</p>
<p>Reeves successfully championed a legislative “earmark” to force MDOT to spend $43 million to widen Lakeland over other projects. Reeves said media are confusing the two roadways.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, Central District Transportation Commissioner Dick Hall said he believed the $2 million state-funded road from the entrance to Reeves’ and another gated subdivision — about 130 homes total — was needed for safety reasons but that he’s halted it because “I may have been wrong.”</p>

<p>“If anybody’s to blame for this, it’s me because I did feel it should be built as far as safety reasons,” Hall said at a news conference. “… If a study shows that we don’t need to build it because of safety concerns, then we are not going to build it. It won’t have anything to do with what anybody in elected office has to say to me, whether it be the lieutenant governor, the mayor or anybody else.”</p>
<p>MDOT records obtained by the Clarion Ledger shows the Lakeland intersection was considered safe before and during widening, and safer still after.</p>
<p>Halting of the road project came after a Clarion Ledger article in which Melinda McGrath, executive director of MDOT, which Hall and two other elected commissioners oversee, said it was being built only because of political pressure from the state Senate, which Reeves oversees.</p>
<p>More: MDOT puts brakes on building road near Lt. Gov. Reeves’ neighborhood</p>
<p>Hall has not refuted McGrath’s statements but reiterated on Wednesday that “the lieutenant governor has never talked with me about this road.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Hall said he has no reason to doubt McGrath and plans to look into her statements about political pressure. As for whether to build the road, he said, “She is an engineer and knows a lot more about it than I do … Now that our engineers, including the director told me it’s not quite as severe as I thought it was for safety, we are going to re-evaluate it.”</p>
<p>Reeves said “I appreciate his honesty” about Hall’s mea culpa. Previously, he said the city of Flowood was the driving force behind the frontage road. But records show his office communicated with MDOT about the project and his neighborhood homeowners’ association, not the city, appeared to be negotiating particulars of the road.</p>
<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves ponders a reporter’s question as he talks about controversial state-funded road projects during a news conference Wednesday, July 11, 2018, at the Capitol in Jackson, Miss.</p>
<p>Reeves on Wednesday said he never had any substantive conversations with his neighborhood property owners’ association about the project, either, other than “there were some conversations in the neighborhood.”</p>
<p>MDOT has spent more than $300,000 buying easements and had planned to let a contract in two weeks for the road. Hall said he doesn’t know at this point whether the road will be built, or when a decision will be made.</p>
<p>Hall said: “Safety numbers now show it has improved, it’s a safer place now, easier to cross the highway … Our engineers are going to reassess it, with all that in mind and determine whether or not that frontage road needs to be built.”</p>
<p>Hall said he was unaware of MDOT’s records showing the neighborhood’s Lakeland intersection was safe until he read about them in the Clarion Ledger and had a conversation with McGrath.</p>
<p>“It brought to mind a lot more discussion about it, particularly from our staff,” Hall said, “because I started asking more questions about it — probably questions I should have asked earlier, but some of them couldn’t be answered because the highway had not been completed.”</p>
<p>Reeves on Wednesday announced that he had sent a letter to McGrath, and supplied a copy to media, wanting to know about any political pressure to build the road.</p>
<p>“Knowing that facts are not always presented accurately or in proper context in deadline-driven news reports written by journalists stretched too thin by decreasing news budgets, I would like to investigate this matter directly with you,” Reeves wrote. “…I feel the responsibility — as the Senate’s presiding officer — to delve further into the details of those accusations … and take corrective steps if warranted.”</p>
<p>McGrath could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Reeves, who plays a large role in setting MDOT’s state budget, said he has only had five meetings with McGrath in the last six years and listed them, saying they were mainly about MDOT’s budget.</p>

<p>Victor Mason is the sheriff of Hinds County, but he’s also a father to two sons.</p>
<p>Most recently, he’s the sheriff who was featured in the June TIME Magazine article about black fathers in America. At first he thought the call was a joke.</p>
<p>“I’m in town, I’d like to do a story with you,” the reporter said. “About you and your son.”</p>
<p>“Man, stop playing,” Mason said.</p>
<p>But the man was in his office to interview him in about 10 minutes after the phone call, he said, and it ended up being more than just a chance to have his voice heard nationwide. The article included two other fathers and sons from Jackson, but also included men from all over the country.</p>
<p>“I was fortunate enough to be able to be raised around a father that was in the workforce, and he was a teacher. So I saw a work ethic early,” said one of those Jackson dads, 50-year-old Jesse Starr III. “… So my son picked that up. You’d make two dollars, you turn it into four. All black men in America and beyond need to have their own business.”</p>
<p>Starr was shown with his son, Jesse Starr IX, 28, of Jackson. Also featured was Vincent Wade Jenkins, 58, and his son, Vincent Wade Knight, 26.</p>
<p>“I won’t say nothing to him that ain’t going to be beneficial for him,” Jenkins said. “I say some sh-t that I know he needs, you know what I’m saying? And whether he listens or not, fine. But I come to find out, he listens to everything I say.”</p>
<p>Mason said being in TIME Magazine was an honor for which he’s “still on a high,” but more than that, he was touched by how similar the story is for so many black fathers.</p>
<p>“If you read these guys, we all talk the same language, we’re all old-school dads,” Mason said. “What you’re dealing with now is a different generation. These kids were raised up on videos and violence and back then we didn’t have that, we just watched planes and trains go by. We had the rules where, ‘Be in when the lights go on, don’t make me come find you.’ We were ruled by belts and switches. All that’s gone.”</p>
<p>A photo of the TIME Magazine in which Hinds County Sheriff Victor Mason is featured.</p>
<p>Mason said when his sons were growing up, he exposed them to life’s “raw footage, that’s all it was. You can talk until you’re blue in the face but, unless you see it, you don’t understand it.”</p>
<p>The first time with his son Christopher was when they were spending the night at a local fire station. His son was 7 years old.</p>
<p>“Every call they went on, we went on,” Mason said.</p>
<p>One of the calls was a head-on collision, the sheriff said. The driver had come from a local bar and was driving under the influence.</p>
<p>“(Chris) knew what Daddy’s job was, so I gave him my flashlight, and I said, ‘Go look. That’s what happens when you drink and drive,’” Mason said.</p>
<p>Another time, Mason and Chris, now 35, walked into the funeral home where a man who had been killed in a shooting was on a gurney.</p>
<p>“‘This is what happens when you think you can play with a gun and try to hurt somebody,’” Mason told his son. “And he was scared, he was really scared.”</p>
<p>Younger son Calen, now 27, got the same treatment, Mason said.</p>
<p>Those, and other lessons like them, have stuck with his sons. Chris now works at Best Buy, and Calen is a professional DJ. Both live in Jackson.</p>
<p>“I brought them down here (to the downtown jail) a couple of times, and they knew this is not where they wanted to live,” Mason said.</p>
<p>There are a few basics missing from how children were raised in Mason’s day and how they are raised today, he said. Children used to be taught to respect their elders and they were guided by their grandmothers.</p>
<p>“Grandmothers raised a lot of these dads now. Back then we called them ‘Big Mamas.’ When you would get in trouble and then you would hug Grandmama, you’d have the smell of powder puffs and peppermints,” Mason said with a smile. “But after enough times, Grandmama would tell you, ‘I’m not going to do this again, so your favors have run out.’”</p>
<p>While the TIME Magazine article highlights fathers who are doing it right, there are a lot who are absent or disconnected, Mason said. And it’s hurting the younger generations.</p>
<p>“This generation, 25 and under, this is probably the most violent generation we’ve seen. I’ve got a 13-year-old (in jail) at Raymond for two counts of armed robbery,” Mason said. &quot;Let’s be real, at 13, what were you doing?</p>
<p>“Gun sales are soaring through the sky, gun permits are soaring through the sky, our jails are popping at the seams. Most of them will tell you, ‘I don’t have a father.’”</p>
<p>Mason said there’s still hope, though, as long as “the village” that it used to take to raise a child is still willing to do that.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have a father either, but I listened to my mother. I listened to the neighbor, I listened to my mama’s friend,” Mason said. &quot;If you know stealing is a crime and not going to school, per se, is a crime, don’t do that.</p>
<p>“Go to someone’s church. Even if you’re not a member, go, because there is a heaven and there is a hell. We as adults need to do better. We need to take (the younger generation) back.”</p>
<p>Mason said he still remembers times at the beauty salon with his mother. It was not exciting to a young boy to see his mother get her hair cut, nor to listen to beauty parlor gossip, but it was time they spent together each week. Time like that, whether it be just going to the grocery store or reading to children at night, is time a parent can strengthen a child’s moral compass, he said.</p>
<p>“I think that now with the climate we live in, we need to grab a-hold of this thing because it’s going to get worse, not better,” Mason said.</p>
<p>That’s the kind of advice Mason said he gives younger fathers who are trying to be good dads. And he said he was encouraged to see in TIME Magazine that he’s not the only one.</p>
<p>“It was interesting reading what a guy from Chicago is saying, versus what I’m saying. And you would think just by the talk we do that we know each other, but we don’t,” he said. “I don’t know any of these guys, but it’s that universal language — ‘I know what I have to do to raise my child because I don’t want him to be a stat.’”</p>

<p>She was Juror No. 2 on one of the panels that sentenced Bobby Glen Wilcher to death in 1994.</p>
<p>Wilcher was 43 when he was put to death 12 years later in October 2006 for the 1982 stabbing deaths of Katie Bell Moore and Velma Odell Noblin. The two Scott County women were stabbed more than 20 times each aftergiving Wilcher a ride home from a Forest nightclub.</p>
<p>Wilcher was tried separately for each woman’s death.</p>
<p>Lindy Lou Wells Isonhood of Yazoo City, or Juror No. 2, regrets agreeing to sentence Wilcher to death, not because she believed him to be innocent, but rather because of what it did to her as a juror.</p>
<p>Isonhood, who went by the last name of Wells at the time, details her experience in the Wilcher case in a national documentary that will air on Mississippi Public Broadcasting, July 16 at 9 p.m…</p>
<p>Isonhood said she was once like most conservative Mississippians who believed an eye for an eye, that if someone murdered another person, he or she should get the death penalty. But her views changed after serving as a juror in Wilcher’s trial in 1994.</p>
<p>She said she was struck during the trial at how Wilcher’s defense didn’t put up an offense. She said it was like his attorneys totally expected the death penalty for their client.</p>
<p>Isonhood said she wanted to give Wilcher life without parole but was given erroneous information when the jury was deliberating that the state didn’t have a life without parole penalty at the time.</p>
<p>The “Point of View” documentary follows Isonhood as she reconnects with fellow jurors to discover how the case has or hasn’t challenged their views on the death penalty.</p>
<p>Isonhood became friends with Wilcher years after he was put on death row, and she visited him the day of his execution.</p>
<p>“‘Lindy Lou, Juror Number 2’ is a film that deals with the criminal justice system in an unusual way. It is not about the murderer or the murders themselves, nor is it about the victims or the investigators. It is about us, about our moral responsibility when the state gives the people the power to decide about someone’s life,” Florent Vassault, the French filmmaker and director of the documentary, said in a statement. “Because any citizen in America could potentially serve on a jury, I thought this story would offer an opportunity to shift our vision of the death penalty from a vague and distant idea to something more tangible and complex.&quot;</p>
<p>Isonhood said when she returned after serving on the jury, she was angry and just wanted to be alone and that went on for weeks.</p>
<p>“Jurors were the forgotten ones,” Isonhood said. “We walked out of the courthouse and just went home.”</p>
<p>Isonhood said she didn’t enjoy life anymore after serving on the jury. She said she found it difficult to talk to anyone about the case because no one wanted to hear about a death penalty case.</p>
<p>Isonhood said she eventually attended professional counseling. “It has helped me heal.”</p>
<p>After serving in death penalty cases, jurors should receive counseling or be given the opportunity for it, Isonhood said.</p>
<p>It’s far-reaching, Isonhood said, when serving as a juror on a death penalty case. “Most walk away a changed person,” she said.</p>
<p>Mississippi’s last execution was in 2012. Executions have been delayed partly because of legal challenges to the drugs used in execution.</p>

<p>Mississippi’s transportation commissioners have halted movement on building a $2 million road from Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves’ neighborhood to a nearby shopping hub.</p>
<p>Central District Transportation Commissioner Dick Hall said that a Clarion Ledger article about the project and concerns raised by Mississippi Department of Transportation Director Melinda McGrath that the road was being built because of political pressure prompted commissioners to postpone taking bids on the project this month.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying we’re not going to do it, but we’re going to postpone it and re-evaluate the need for it,” Hall said.</p>
<p>Hall said that he had believed the road was needed for safety, but that the Clarion Ledger article and McGrath’s comments caused him concern. He said he spoke with his two fellow elected commissioners and they decided to hold off on bidding out the project while they examine it further.</p>
<p>“(McGrath is an engineer — she’s the head engineer — and knows a lot more about it than I do as a layman,” Hall said. “Now that our engineers including the director told me the need for it might not be quite as severe as I thought it was, we are going to re-evaluate.”</p>
<p>Hall said MDOT might reconsider putting a “J-turn” at the neighborhoods’ current Lakeland intersection. MDOT had proposed this, which would cost about $200,000 compared to $2 million for the new road, but the property owners’ association in Reeves’ neighborhood, which has appeared to be calling the shots on the project, rejected it.</p>
<p>More: MDOT: Political pressure driving road connecting Tate Reeves’ subdivision, shopping center</p>
<p>Records obtained by the Clarion Ledger showed MDOT had purchased more than $300,000 in rights of way and was planning to take bids for an estimated $2 million “frontage road” from the gated neighborhoods of Oakridge, where Reeves lives, and Dogwood subdivisions off Lakeland Drive. The road would run to nearby Dogwood Festival Boulevard and its shopping centers. The public is not allowed to drive through the neighborhoods and the frontage road — which would not front any current development — would primarily serve only motorists in the 130 or so homes in the subdivisions.</p>
<p>The road would be the second and final phase of a $45 million project to widen Mississippi 25/Lakeland Drive to six lanes near Reeves’ neighborhood. Reeves and the Senate over which he presides forced MDOT to leap-frog the Lakeland project over repairs to deteriorated roads and bridges elsewhere that MDOT had slated.</p>
<p>McGrath said the new road is being driven by “political pressure … from the Legislature.” She would not specify from whom the pressure is coming other than “the Senate side.” But MDOT communications records indicate staff in Reeves’ lieutenant governor’s office and his neighborhood property owners’ association have communicated with MDOT on the project.</p>
<p>The new road is ostensibly for safety of neighborhood motorists, an alternative to trying to turn left onto Lakeland Drive at their current intersection. But MDOT records indicate safety is not the issue. The intersection was relatively safe before Lakeland was widened and safer now, according to MDOT records. The road was being pushed ahead of many others with worse safety concerns and more traffic.</p>
<p>The new road comes as the state grapples with paying for repairs to deteriorated bridges and roadways statewide. Much “new” construction is being postponed so MDOT can focus on “preservation.”</p>
<p>Reeves has been unapologetic about pushing for the larger Lakeland widening project. But through a spokeswoman declined to be interviewed about the new frontage road before the article and again on Tuesday. His office issued a statement saying the city, not his office, had been pushing for the new road. McGrath countered this and said MDOT would not have been building it at the city’s request.</p>
<p>Hall’s Northern District and Southern District counterparts could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>

<p>Senators debated the merits of President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. A day after he announced his choice, Democrats expressed their concerns while Republicans urged their Democratic colleagues to “give him a chance.” (July 10) AP</p>
<p>Rallies are planned at three Senate District offices in Mississippi Tuesday night in response to President Trump nominating Brett Kavanaugh for the United States Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Organized by Planned Parenthood Southeast, the rallies will take place in Gulfport and Hattiesburg at 5:30 p.m. and in Jackson at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Abortion rights activists have expressed concern that, with a largely conservative court, Roe vs Wade could be overturned. One in four American women will have an abortion by age 45, according to a 2017 study by the Guttmacher Institute.</p>
<p>Felicia Brown-Williams, with Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates, said Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court would be “dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I cannot overstate how dangerous Kavanaugh’s nomination is for millions of women across this country,&quot; Brown-Williams said. “At least 20 states are poised to immediately seek to ban abortion if Roe v. Wade were overturned.— Mississippi included. Not only that, but this open seat is an invitation for hostile states like ours to pursue additional restrictions and bans.”</p>
<p>As examples, Williams pointed to the 15-week abortion ban Mississippi legislators approved earlier this year and the constitutional amendment on the ballot in Alabama in November that would “pave the way to ban abortion in all cases — even in cases of rape, incest, or if the life of the women is at risk.”</p>
<p>“This nomination would have real, immediate consequences for the people we serve, and that is especially worrisome here in Mississippi, where women are consistently underserved and infant and maternal health is among the worst in the country,” she said.</p>
<p>Mississippi Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith issued statements Monday night, supporting Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>Staci Fox, president and CEO at Planned Parenthood Southeast Advocates, said her organization opposes the nomination of Kavanaugh and is calling on senators to do the same.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, the right to access abortion in this country is on the line,” Fox said. &quot;President Trump promised to only appoint justices who will overturn Roe v. Wade and with the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, he has done just that. Brett Kavanaugh has already ruled to limit access to safe, legal abortion and he’s even ruled against women’s access to birth control.</p>
<p>“For more than 45 years, abortion has been a safe and legal medical procedure in this country and it must remain safe and legal for a woman to consider if and when she needs it.”</p>

<p>Mississippi Civil Rights Museum Director Pamela Junior talks about the new museum’s central exhibition before presenting a question which may provoke introspection in visitors. Sarah Warnock</p>
<p>JACKSON — Two Mississippi history museums have attracted more visitors in their first seven months than officials predicted for an entire year.</p>
<p>More than 185,000 people have toured the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the adjoining Museum of Mississippi History since they opened in December as part of the state’s bicentennial celebration, state Department of Archives and History director Katie Blount said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The original prediction was for about 180,000 visitors the first year.</p>
<p>The side-by-side museums are in downtown Jackson, near the state Capitol. The Museum of Mississippi History takes a 15,000-year view, from the Stone Age through modern times. The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum concentrates mostly on 1945 to 1976, including exhibitions on the push for voting rights for African-Americans. The two museums are funded by state money and private donations.</p>
<p>About 16,000 people toured the museums when the W.K. Kellogg Foundation provided free admission for four days in January to commemorate the birthdate of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
<p>Blount said visitors have come from all 82 counties in Mississippi and several countries, including Australia, Brazil, China, France, Japan, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Almost 100,000 students, from kindergarten to high school, have visited.</p>
<p>“It is especially gratifying to see so many school children experiencing the museums and learning about our shared past,” Blount said in a news release.</p>
<p>The museums’ administrator, Cindy Gardner, said group tours have been popular, with people visiting from summer camps, family reunions, church groups and special interest tours.</p>
<p>The museums are open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and 1-5 p.m. Sunday. They are closed Monday.</p>

<p>WEST POINT, Miss. (AP) — A Mississippi tire factory says it has fired 29 employees for not meeting job requirements.</p>
<p>WCBI-TV reports employees at the West Point plant of Yokohama Rubber Co. Ltd were fired for using fake worker certifications. The Japanese company neither confirms nor denies that, but says it’s investigating and has created safeguards to prevent problems from happening again.</p>
<p>The workers obtained fraudulent certificates from a job-training program that companies use to determine the aptitude of potential hires.</p>

<p>U.S. Sen. Doug Jones introduced a bill Tuesday that would clear the way to open records from civil rights cold cases — a bill written by high school students.</p>
<p>The Alabama Democrat, who was joined on Capitol Hill by 18 of the students who helped craft it, knows these cases well. In the early 2000s, he led the successful prosecutions of Bobby Frank Cherry and Thomas Blanton in connection with the Ku Klux Klan’s bombing of a Birmingham church that killed four girls in 1963.</p>
<p>Jones, whose bill is co-sponsored by Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, said these records can play an important role, not only for the victims’ families, but for communities and even relatives of those who committed these crimes.</p>
<p>“An incredible level of healing and reconciliation can accompany knowledge,” he said. “Given the age of these cases and the fact it is highly unlikely that these cases could be resurrected, this is the way to get that healing and reconciliation.”</p>
<p>The students’ teacher, Stuart Wexler, said when he told his students in 2015 about how many civil rights cold cases had gone unsolved and how many of those files remained redacted, they were upset.</p>
<p>Abigail Nickerson, now a 19-year-old junior at Vanderbilt University, said she and her fellow high school students voted to create a bill to address the problem.</p>
<p>“I could see that this was a chance to work towards something far more important than a 5 on the AP Government Exam,” she said, “something that could directly impact the lives of hundreds of Americans and work towards addressing past injustices in our country.”</p>
<p>The bill would create an independent review board of experts to analyze and release government files on civil rights cold cases. The bill mirrors the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992, which cleared the way for releasing thousands of documents related to the assassination.</p>
<p>Louis Allen was ambushed and killed outside his home near Liberty on Jan. 31, 1964.</p>
<p>On Jan. 31, 1964, Louis Allen was fatally ambushed in front of his home near Liberty, Mississippi, not long after he identified the killer of Herbert Lee as a Mississippi lawmaker.</p>
<p>Allen’s grandson, who bears the same name, said he has seen the FBI documents on the case. “The majority of it is redacted,” he said.</p>
<p>Opening the records so that the family can finally learn the truth “would mean as much as it would to a person who grew up in South Africa and had the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,” he said.</p>
<p>Even without justice, he said, opening the records would provide “at least a measure of hope that the system has changed.”</p>
<p>Louisiana journalist Stanley Nelson, who is now investigating the 1965 killing of deputy Oneal Moore in Bogalusa, said if the bill passed, it would aid investigations like his “by light years.”</p>
<p>Nelson, who was named a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his work in reopening the 1964 killing of Frank Morris, said one of the most frustrating things is so many parts of the FBI files are redacted, blotting out the names of suspects or witnesses in cases.</p>
<p>As a result, it “may take months, if not years, trying to figure out who they are and then figure out if they are alive or dead,” he said.</p>
<p>If the bill were to pass, he said, “what has been a constant struggle the last 10 years of my life would suddenly be a struggle no more.”</p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Hank Klibanoff, an Emory University journalism professor who works with students in investigating civil rights cold cases, said government “spends a lot of time with problems for which there are no solutions. In this case, it strikes me as a simple problem with a simple solution. And Doug Jones has that solution in the bill.”</p>
<p>One of the students who worked on the bill, James Ward, a 17-year-old senior at Hightstown High School in New Jersey, noted that the Justice Department has closed 113 civil rights cold cases.</p>
<p>“At the very least, the families of victims deserve to see the files of the cold cases,” he said. “Additionally, every solved civil rights cold case has been figured out with the help of investigative reporters, historians and even high school students. By giving the public access to the case records, the possibility to solve any civil rights cold case remains open. There is no statute of limitations on murder.”</p>
<p>Oslene Johnson, now an 18-year-old marketing communications student at Berkeley College, said passage of this bill would “signify to our entire nation that the people whose lives and livelihoods were stolen because of racial discrimination mattered then, and they and their families matter now.”</p>
<p>Ali Husaini, 18, who just graduated from Hightstown and is headed to Franklin &amp; Marshall College this fall, led class discussions on the best strategies for approaching lawmakers.</p>
<p>He sees the bill as something that could affirm the allegiance we pledge each day to our nation, enabling the nation to address its “complicated civil rights history” while staying “true to its core foundation of justice under the law.”</p>
<p>Samantha Harrison, a 17-year-old senior at Hightstown, has been involved in contacting lawmakers and meeting with their staffs, urging them to pass the bill.</p>
<p>“It’s showed me that even though I am not old enough to vote and I’m not an adult yet, I can still have a voice and make an impact in our government,” she said.</p>
<p>If the bill were to become law, she said, “I honestly would probably cry, cry for me, for my fellow students, for supporters and for the families of the people who have faced racial injustices.”</p>

<p>Prosecutors in the burning death of 19-year-old Jessica Chambers have new evidence they believe plugs a previous hole in their case, and it might not have gone public if not for Monday’s hearing.</p>
<p>Quinton Tellis has pleaded not guilty to capital murder in Chambers’ slaying. Prosecutors believe Tellis had sex with Chambers before he set her and her car on fire and left her to die the night of Dec. 6, 2014, in Courtland in Panola County. She died at a hospital in Memphis.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Monday that a witness has been found who allegedly gave Tellis a ride from an area close to where Chambers’ car keys were found to Tellis’ sister’s home. Three additional witnesses connected to that information will also be introduced in the Tellis’ retrial, officials said. The first trial ended in a mistrial after the jury deadlocked on a verdict.</p>
<p>That information could be key in filling in a blank regarding Tellis’ whereabouts throughout the night Chambers died.</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Jay Hale argued at a hearing in the case Monday was that the prosecution had just turned over discovery on that information to the defense on June 28. On July 2, four days later, the defense filed motions to sanction District Attorney John Champion for prosecutorial misconduct, to have him and his team removed from the case, and to delay the trial from its scheduled date of Sept. 24.</p>
<p>Champion had spoken to Jalen Caudle, a possible witness who alleged he had information from Tellis. Caudle is also another client of Tellis defense attorney Dana Palmer, and Palmer said Champion should not have talked to Caudle without her present. Champion argued he was seeing Caudle as a witness in the Tellis case and had advised him they would not talk about his capital murder case.</p>
<p>Judge Gerald Chatham threw out the defense motions to continue the trial and remove the prosecution team, and said it was up to the Mississippi Bar rather than him to sanction a district attorney.</p>
<p>During Tellis’ first trial, federal intelligence analyst Paul Rowlett detailed the movements of Tellis and Chambers through phone records and security video. The two had been parked in a driveway next to Tellis’ home, and their phones were both inactive between 6:49 and 7:26. Within four minutes, Chambers’ phone signal then shows up on Herron Road, where she was later burned alive.</p>
<p>At 7:42 p.m., Tellis’ phone “woke up,” and he used it to call Chambers and tell her he had a girlfriend coming over and he couldn’t see her that night.</p>
<p>After that, Tellis called an out-of-state girlfriend to tell her he was walking to his sister’s house to borrow her Tahoe. Investigators pointed out a cut-through trail from where Chambers was found on Herron Road to the subdivision in which Tellis’ sister lives. Chambers’ keys would later be found in a yard along that route.</p>
<p>That is where the witness is said to have picked Tellis up and taken him to his sister’s house to borrow her car.</p>
<p>Tellis’ cell data showed no activity again until 8 p.m., according to the prosecution. During that time, a vehicle could be seen on gas station video pulling into a storage shed where gasoline was stored, but the image of the vehicle was dark.</p>
<p>At 8 p.m., a vehicle matching the description of Tellis’ sister’s SUV could be seen on gas station video speeding toward Batesville. Tellis told investigators it “could be” him.</p>
<p>At 8:04 p.m., Chambers’ phone made its last communications with a cell tower. Investigators say it shut off when it got too hot.</p>

<p>MDOT has plans for an additional $2 million frontage road project along Lakeland Drive that will connect Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves’ gated subdivision to Dogwood Festival Market shopping center. The project is a result of an earmark passed by the Legislature.</p>
<p>While the state grapples with how to pay to fix crumbling roads and bridges, the Mississippi Department of Transportation is being politically forced to build a $2-million drive from Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves’ gated neighborhood to a nearby shopping hub.</p>
<p>The project is ostensibly for safety of neighborhood motorists, but MDOT records obtained by the Clarion Ledger indicate safety is not the issue and that Reeves’ office kept tabs on it while his neighborhood’s homeowners association was deeply involved in the project’s planning.</p>
<p>The new road project comes after Reeves and the Senate forced MDOT to leap-frog $43 million to widen Mississippi 25/Lakeland Drive near his neighborhood over repairs to deteriorated roads and bridges elsewhere across the state.</p>
<p>As some lawmakers continue to criticize MDOT as inefficient and lacking priorities for roadwork, the Legislature frequently overrides the agency’s priorities by ordering millions of dollars of pet projects in MDOT’s annual budget legislation.</p>
<p>This map shows the location of the proposed $2-million road between the entrance to two gated subdivisions — Dogwood Place and Oakridge Trail — and Dogwood Boulevard. (If you cannot see the map, click here.)</p>
<p>MDOT: No road without ‘political pressure’</p>
<p>MDOT plans to start an estimated $2 million project this month to build a “frontage road” from Oakridge Trail to Dogwood Boulevard, as part of the larger Lakeland Drive widening project.</p>
<p>The new road will start near the locked-gate entrances of Oakridge Trail — where Reeves lives — and Dogwood Place subdivisions and end at the Dogwood Festival Market shopping center. The road would not front any current developments and would likely receive little public traffic besides those living in the 130 or so houses in Oakridge and Dogwood.</p>
<p>“Yes. Political pressure. From the Legislature,” said MDOT Director Melinda McGrath when asked why the new road is being built. “We would not have done this otherwise.”</p>
<p>Normally, MDOT would build such a road only if its other construction had homes or businesses “landlocked” from a major roadway or a development was coming, in which case the developer and/or local government would foot much of the cost.</p>
<p>McGrath would not specify from whom the pressure is coming, other than “the Senate side.” McGrath said much of the communication from the Capitol to MDOT on the new road has been verbal. But MDOT communications records indicate staff in Reeves’ lieutenant governor’s office and his neighborhood’s property owners’ association have communicated with MDOT on the project.</p>
<p>And Reeves has been unapologetic about pushing for the larger Lakeland Drive widening, of which the new road from his neighborhood is the second and final phase.</p>
<p>Reeves through a spokeswoman declined an interview about the new road but issued a statement saying, “Reeves has not spoken to anyone at the agency regarding the Frontage Road and believes (the project) was negotiated between the city of Flowood and MDOT.”</p>
<p>But MDOT records indicate Reeves’ neighborhood property owners’ association, not the city of Flowood, has attempted to call the shots on how the new road is built.</p>
<p>In a list of early “demands” the neighborhood gave MDOT, it wanted the new road to have only one-way traffic from the neighborhood to Dogwood Boulevard. MDOT balked at building what would have essentially been a state-funded private driveway.</p>
<p>Flowood Mayor Gary Rhoads said he knows of no political pressure from Reeves for MDOT to build the new road, and the city supports it as a “safety issue.” He agreed with Reeves that the city was the impetus for building the road. He said any talk that Reeves pushed for it is “BS if I’ve ever heard it.”</p>
<p>But records indicate the Oakridge Property Owners’ Association at one point shot down the city of Flowood’s support for MDOT building a “J-turn,” which could have been a cheaper, roughly $200,000 alternative to the new $2 million road — at the existing Oakridge/Lakeland intersection.</p>
<p>In a letter to Rhoads in June 2017 urging the city to drop its support for a J-turn, the head of the Oakridge Property Owners’ Association gave Rhoads an update on the progress of frontage road negotiations, “Since you have not been privy to our communications with MDOT concerning the proposed frontage road ….”</p>
<p>McGrath said: “That frontage road is not being built because the mayor or city requested it. We do not feel any pressure to build it because the mayor would say so.”</p>
<p>MDOT records show much dickering between the Oakridge Property Owners’ Association and MDOT from 2016-2017 over the frontage road. The neighborhood voiced concerns over whether it would be reimbursed for easement property for the project (the neighborhood eventually agreed to donate it). MDOT paid other property owners along the stretch a total of $323,000, including $297,000 to the Hogg family trust.</p>
<p>Oakridge Property Owners’ Association also haggled over what plants and trees MDOT would replace after construction, whether the road could be restricted to one-way traffic from the neighborhood to Dogwood Boulevard (it won’t be) and whether MDOT would promise to never close the existing Oakridge/Lakeland intersection or put in a J-turn (it would not).</p>
<p>At one point in negotiations an MDOT attorney in a letter to the head of the homeowners’ group wrote: “MDOT instructed me to point out that this project is for the benefit solely of the Oakridge homeowners and expeditious execution (of deeds and easements) would be appreciated.”</p>
<p>Lakeland intersection not a safety concern</p>
<p>The new road is ostensibly for safety — so those leaving the gated neighborhoods don’t have to navigate across a busy Lakeland Drive intersection when attempting to head west, particularly since Lakeland has been widened to six lanes.</p>
<p>But records indicate the intersection was relatively safe before the widening and has become safer since.</p>
<p>From December 2017 through May — the six months after Lakeland Drive was widened — there was only one crash, and it was not severe. It was a fender-bender involving a driver who was admittedly not paying attention and was not related to anyone turning at the intersection.</p>
<p>The existing intersection has scored low on MDOT engineers’ “severity index” before and after widening.</p>
<p>In fact, the Oakridge Property Owners’ Association in a letter to Flowood Mayor Gary Rhoads urging him to drop the idea for a J-turn said the existing intersection is safe and relatively easy to navigate.</p>
<p>“As someone who utilizes our existing median cross-over for westbound turns on a daily basis, I can tell you that traffic lights at Dogwood Festival Boulevard and further east at Luckney Road are timed such that we have ample opportunities to safely cross at the existing median cross-over,” Walter Brand, attorney and board president of the Oakridge Property Owners’ Association, wrote to Rhoads. “… We have used that cross-over for more than ten years (since the inception of our neighborhood) with relatively few safety problems.”</p>
<p>Brand did not return calls for comment.</p>
<p>The statement from Reeves’ office said: “The lieutenant governor suggested a red light years ago at the intersection due to a number of accidents that had occurred. MDOT evidently did not view that as a good option … He does support the Frontage Road as a safe alternative since the red light suggestion was not viewed by MDOT as a good option. He appreciates city leaders for many years of work on this entire project.”</p>
<p>Senate, Reeves pushed Lakeland to top of list</p>
<p>Reeves drew fire from House leaders in 2014 after Senate negotiators inserted the Lakeland Drive widening and other projects into MDOT’s budget bill in the 11th hour of heated negotiations.</p>
<p>House leaders noted the project was near where Reeves lives and killed the bill just before the deadline for its passage.</p>
<p>“I make no apologies for fighting to prioritize projects in our state,” Reeves said at the time. “Have you ever ridden down Highway 25? It is without question the project that needs funding more than any other, and for whatever reason the Department of Transportation has not made it a priority.”</p>
<p>The standoff left MDOT’s budget in limbo and lawmakers were forced to return to Jackson in special session to pass MDOT’s budget and other unfinished business.</p>
<p>House members in the special session refused to accept what they called the Senate’s “pet projects” in the MDOT bill, and it was passed without them.</p>
<p>But Reeves persisted.</p>
<p>MDOT communications records show his office sent the agency pointed questions about progress on the widening project, and “The Lt. Governor sent word that he was aggravated and wanted a definitive construction letting date,” said an email from an MDOT government affairs official that was circulated among other officials.</p>
<p>The need to widen Lakeland Drive from Mississippi 475 to Grants Ferry Road, a stretch that carries about 40,000 cars a day, was on MDOT’s radar — along with numerous roadways across the state with heavy traffic. But dozens of such projects have been on hold in recent years as MDOT focuses on repairing deteriorated roads and bridges. Records show the agency has 13 arteries across the state carrying 40,000 to 112,000 cars a day listed as needing “immediate” improvements because of traffic.</p>
<p>McGrath sent Reeves a letter on Aug. 4, 2014, explaining that because of budget restraints MDOT had been “forced to shift to a system preservation program” — focusing on repairing dangerously deteriorated roads and bridges more than new projects such as widening Lakeland Drive. She explained that tackling the Lakeland Drive project would require delaying $35 million worth of other projects slated for fiscal 2016.</p>
<p>Reeves apparently didn’t like the agency’s answers. In 2015, the Senate successfully added the widening project as an “earmark” to MDOT’s budget bill, over continued criticism from House leaders. The earmark effectively required the agency to spend millions in state and federal funds and make the project a priority, without allocating more money for it. (See an MDOT list of projects with immediate need at bottom of story.)</p>
<p>The recent statement from Reeves’ spokeswoman said: “The Lieutenant Governor thought MDOT was moving too slow on this critical project, so he worked with House and Senate appropriators to specify the funds in MDOT’s budget to jumpstart the project. It is now complete, and he is proud the Legislature did their job in getting this much needed project to completion.”</p>
<p>The drive from Reeves’ neighborhood to Dogwood Boulevard is the second and final phase of a project that will total about $45 million.</p>
<p>Reeves has shown a special interest in the project. He was on hand at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the expanded six-lane stretch of Lakeland and said: “Any commuter has seen the difference this finished project has made over the past few weeks, and I look forward to seeing more private investments and jobs in Rankin County as a result.”</p>
<p>MDOT not insulated from politics</p>
<p>Other than the work near his home, Reeves has been critical of MDOT and had a rocky relationship with the agency. This year, as the House and Senate sparred over road and bridge spending plans and failed to pass anything, Reeves proposed the “BRIDGE Act.” A key component of Reeves’ plan was to strip $125 million from MDOT over five years, and give the governor — an office Reeves hopes to win next year — control over much state road spending.</p>
<p>“The really galling thing is (the proposal) sets up two special funds to be utilized by the governor and prevent MDOT from buying right of way,” Central District Transportation Commissioner Dick Hall said at the time. “That means whoever the next governor is will decide where the projects are built … It will be like Louisiana: The governor picks out his friends and political supporters and that’s where the roads get built … It’s a political answer to a very serious question, and I am really disappointed.”</p>
<p>MDOT is governed by a three-member elected commission, one each from northern, central and southern districts and the agency is run by a director appointed by the commission. This setup is in part to insulate road-building decisions from legislative and gubernatorial politics.</p>
<p>Hall, when first asked about the road from Reeves’ neighborhood, said he believed it was “strictly a safety deal” and no one from the lieutenant governor’s office — “no one in a political office” — had pressured or talked with MDOT about building it. He also said he didn’t recollect the larger Lakeland Drive project being pushed by Reeves or a legislative earmark.</p>
<p>He called back later that day and said, “I may have spoken too soon.”</p>
<p>“The lieutenant governor did not talk to me about (the new road), but the lieutenant governor’s office did talk to our staff about it, I am told, and they had also wanted that money spent on adding lanes to the highway,” Hall said. “… (Reeves’) office did stay in touch with our staff about the progress (of widening) and wanted the project moved up in priority.”</p>
<p>But Hall said he still believes the new frontage road is needed for safety.</p>
<p>Stop lights, J-turns would be cheaper</p>
<p>McGrath said that as Lakeland Drive was being widened, there was more “legislative pressure” for MDOT to put a traffic signal at the neighborhoods’ Lakeland Drive intersection to help those leaving the neighborhoods turn left onto the highway more easily. But MDOT engineers determined it would be too close to the light at Dogwood Boulevard and would create a traffic “bog” and safety issues.</p>
<p>McGrath said “there were then discussions that if we didn’t do a traffic signal there that there would be attempts made to force us legislatively to put a light there.”</p>
<p>MDOT offered to build a “J-turn” at the intersection. A J-turn design has drivers turn right in the same direction as traffic, then merge into the left lane to make a U-turn to avoid crossing traffic. There are other J turn intersections in similar areas along Lakeland. Building such a turn would have cost about $200,000, McGrath estimated.</p>

<p>This idea was rejected, and the new, $2-million frontage road project was born.</p>
<p>MDOT communications records from Feb. 1, 2016, from MDOT’s head of governmental affairs said, “The Lt. Governor (staff) has called to ask if we could provide a comprehensive update on:</p>
<p>“1. The progress of the Lakeland Drive construction project</p>
<p>“2. The latest ongoings on the access to the two gated neighborhoods, specifically related to signalization and the frontage road that has been discussed.”</p>
<p>MDOT responded by copying an engineer’s response that said completion of the widening is on schedule and provided details. It also responded that MDOT was in discussions with the city about the frontage road and would know more in a couple of weeks. MDOT plans to turn the road over to the city when it’s complete.</p>
<p>A Reeves staffer emailed in response: “Never told you thank you for this, but thank you. Very helpful.”</p>

<p>A man who allegedly stabbed his mother and grandmother at the McComb Social Security office Monday is dead after being shot by a security guard.</p>
<p>The Enterprise-Journal posted to social media that three ambulances, each carrying a person on a stretcher, left the office, and said hospital officials confirmed the alleged attacker, 21-year-old Branen Carter, is dead.</p>
<p>Carter’s mother, Lee Anna Turnage, and grandmother, Ann Carter are in stable condition at Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center in McComb.</p>
<p>Pike County Coroner Jason Jones told The Associated Press that a relative of the family told him the two women had an appointment at the office and gave Branen Carter a ride. The family came from Foxworth, about 40 miles east of McComb.</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security Cmdr. Russell Adcox confirmed the assault and shooting, which occurred about 11 a.m. The Federal Protective Service, which provides security for government agencies, released a statement:</p>
<p>“At approximately 11:00 A.M. Central, a protective security officer at the McComb, Mississippi, Social Security Administration Office witnessed an individual attack and stab two other individuals in the lobby, ultimately shooting the attacker. Three individuals were taken to Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center. The details of this incident are currently under investigation by the Federal Protective Service, McComb Police Department, and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.”</p>
<p>Director of Communications for the Federal Protective Service, Robert Sperling said his agency has a long history of using armed security guards at federal agencies it oversees.</p>
<p>“It’s a cornerstone. We have officers in Social Security offices and most federal agencies across the country, such as the IRS,” Sperling said.</p>
<p>Sperling said the department would release the identity of the security guard once the investigation is completed.</p>

<p class="byline">by: Therese Apel</p>
<p class="date">2018-07-08</p>
<p class="source">url: <a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2018/07/09/defense-motion-jessica-chambers-case-reaches-closing-arguments/768533002/">https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2018/07/09/defense-motion-jessica-chambers-case-reaches-closing-arguments/768533002/</a></p>
<p>After about three hours of testimony and arguments, Panola County Circuit Judge Gerald Chatham ruled that the trial in the December 2014 burning death of 19-year-old Jessica Chambers will continue as scheduled.</p>
<p>What was originally scheduled as a status hearing became much more dramatic Monday in Chatham’s courtroom as Quinton Tellis, accused in Chambers’ death, sat quietly next to his attorneys waiting on the judge to rule on three motions his attorneys had filed.</p>
<p>The hearing became less about Tellis and more about the man prosecuting him.</p>
<p>The motions filed against District Attorney John Champion by Tellis’ defense attorneys Darla Palmer and Alton Peterson asked that the DA’s office be recused and sanctioned. The defense alleges Champion attempted to coerce an inmate into testifying against Tellis. The defense also asked for a continuance in the scheduled Sept. 24 retrial.</p>
<p>Chatham ruled against the defense so the case will go on as planned on Sept. 24, 2018.</p>

<p>Chambers was found on Herron Road in the Panola County town of Courtland a little after 8 p.m. on Dec. 6, 2014, walking away from her burning vehicle with burns over 98 percent of her body. In the small community of barely 500, almost all the first responders on the scene knew her and her family.</p>
<p>She was flown to a Memphis hospital, where she died just hours later. Coroner Gracie Gulledge said the cause of the young woman’s death was thermal injury.</p>
<p>On Feb. 23, 2016, authorities identified a suspect. They announced that Tellis had been indicted that month on capital murder charges by a special grand jury in Panola County. He went to trial in October, which resulted in a hung jury. Chambers appeared to name “Eric” as her assailant, according to testimony from multiple first responders at Tellis’ trial. Authorities interviewed a number of people named Eric and Derrick and found no viable leads.</p>
<p>Tellis’ defense attorneys say inmate Jalen Caudle alleges that on April 5, Champion met with him to try to get him to testify that Tellis told him that Chambers had called him “Eric” as a pet name. Caudle testified before the judge that Champion told him that he could escalate and/or de-escalate charges and that if he didn’t say Tellis had made that statement, that Caudle would go to prison for the rest of his life. Caudle is charged with capital murder in a DeSoto County case.</p>
<p>Palmer represents Caudle as well as Tellis.</p>
<p>Champion testified he did meet with Caudle after another inmate, Kenneth Vogt, told his attorney Jeff Odom that Caudle had said Tellis had told him Chambers’ nickname for Tellis was “Eric.”</p>
<p>Since it seemed Vogt was angling for a deal, Champion said he circumvented talking to him and went straight to Caudle, the source of the alleged information.</p>
<p>Champion said the moment he met Caudle, he told him who he was and that he, by the Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct, could not speak to Caudle about his case. He said then that Caudle volunteered the “Eric” statement.</p>
<p>Caudle’s testimony was that the district attorney threatened him and told him he would have to fire Palmer as his attorney and get a different one so he could testify.</p>
<p>According to jail records, Caudle then sent a communication to his father that this was a serious situation and he needed to speak to Palmer immediately. Palmer stressed that her client had to have been upset by the communications with the DA in order to react like that.</p>
<p>Palmer said she met with Caudle on April 10, and then again with co-counsel Peterson on April 18. The motions weren’t filed until July 2, which was brought up by the prosecution.</p>
<p>That, Palmer said, was because she has several other cases in the 17th district and she wanted to make sure she could get all her details before she risked prejudicial treatment for her other clients.</p>
<p>After speaking to Palmer, Caudle sent a communication to his sister that said he believed he was going to “get a lawsuit out of this” and that he would “be home by July.”</p>
<p>Caudle testified that what he meant was that Palmer had told him these were serious allegations against the DA’s office and that his saying he’d be home by July was simply mirroring Palmer’s confidence in his case.</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Jay Hale stated in closing arguments that the prosecution had just turned over discovery on some new evidence in the case. The discovery was turned over June 28, he said.</p>
<p>But as to Caudle’s story, Champion said once he heard it, he knew it wasn’t true. His main reason was that Tellis, he said, was an “experienced convict,” and wouldn’t just volunteer such evidence to a young kid he had just met while incarcerated.</p>
<p>One of the defense’s hangups was that Champion had initiated contact with Caudle without Palmer’s presence, which would be forbidden should he be talking about Caudle’s case. But Champion told the court he looked at Caudle as a possible witness, and that he told him up front that he could not discuss Caudle’s case with him.</p>
<p>Palmer argued that by simply being the district attorney, which can be intimidating, that in essence, Caudle felt as though Champion was discussing Caudle’s case with him.</p>
<p>Champion testified that he consulted colleagues and the Mississippi Rules of Professional Conduct before he spoke with Caudle. He argued that since he was seeing Caudle as a witness, he was within his bounds since he did not discuss his case.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Champion said, he did not believe Caudle’s story. He said the prosecution does not plan to use any part of it. He didn’t tell Caudle he didn’t believe him, he said. But, he asserted, if that had been true, it would have been huge for the prosecution. He stated that he wasn’t going to risk his case on what appeared to be bad testimony.</p>
<p>Both sides of the case agreed that communications between the prosecution and the defense have been good if not absolutely amicable. But that’s part of why the lack of communication caused the rift, they said.</p>
<p>Palmer and Peterson pointed to the fact Champion didn’t consult them about Caudle’s story and the meeting. Palmer said she wasn’t sure she could trust the prosecution anymore.</p>
<p>Hale pointed out that perhaps Palmer or Peterson could have called Champion as well to ask about the meeting. He said all of their research into the situation that Palmer said had set her back in her other cases stemmed from the words of one person: Caudle.</p>
<p>Chatham said that he does not feel that the Circuit Court is the proper venue to decide if there was any prosecutorial misconduct, saying instead it should be brought up with the Mississippi Bar.</p>
<p>“I see no misconduct that would prejudice the case against Quinton Tellis,” he said.</p>
<p>He then overruled the motion for the DA’s office to recuse itself and the request for a continuance and sanctions against the prosecution.</p>

<p>BYRAM — Mississippi anti-drug officials have handed off prosecution of a suspected drug dealer to federal officials in hopes of punishing him more harshly in connection with heroin overdose deaths.</p>
<p>The move comes after a bill to mandate harsher punishments in state law failed earlier this year in Mississippi’s Legislature.</p>
<p>Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics Director John Dowdy confirmed Monday that the state handed off prosecution of 59-year-old Kelvin Roy Thompson of Jackson to federal agencies. Federal criminal sentences can be lengthened for people selling drugs resulting in overdose deaths.</p>
<p>Thompson has pleaded not guilty to three counts of distributing methamphetamine. He’s being held without bail pending a trial currently scheduled for Aug. 27 before U.S. District Judge David Bramlette III in Jackson. He faces up to 120 years in prison if convicted of the methamphetamine charges.</p>
<p>Kelvin Thompson (Photo: Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics)</p>
<p>Thompson’s lawyer didn’t immediately respond Friday to an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>Agents say they arrested Thompson in January with not only about 40 grams of suspected methamphetamine but also approximately four grams of suspected heroin. He was released from jail on bail and then arrested again in mid-February.</p>
<p>“There are a number of incidents relating to drug overdoses and drug overdose deaths that we are continuing to investigate with this individual,” Dowdy said, saying Thompson was “moving a substantial amount” of illegal drugs in Jackson. Dowdy said following a news conference at bureau headquarters in Byram that there were no drug overdoses in Hinds County for two-and-a-half months after Thompson’s arrest, indicating that showed Thompson’s significance as a heroin dealer.</p>
<p>Federal law calls for a 20-year minimum mandatory sentence for selling an illegal drug if death or serious bodily injury results. Dowdy said state and federal agents continue to investigate overdoses with hopes of submitting additional evidence to U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst. Dowdy, a former federal prosecutor, said that could lead to Thompson being re-indicted for additional crimes.</p>
<p>House Judiciary A Committee Chairman Mark Baker, a Brandon Republican, proposed the unsuccessful House Bill 183 . It would have required anyone who sold or transferred an illegal drug that resulted in death to be sentenced to at least 40 years in prison and up to life. It passed Baker’s own committee, but died in the House Drug Policy Committee.</p>
<p>Baker said one Mississippi district attorney is trying to convict a drug dealer of second-degree murder in relation to an overdose, but that the matter is currently on appeal.</p>
<p>“The DA is having to try to work through the law that exists, that should have been much more clear cut and easier to get to.”</p>
<p>Some people oppose the stiffer sentences like those set out under federal law, though. The Drug Policy Alliance, in a November report, said 20 states can charge people with murder or manslaughter in the case of drug overdoses. The alliance, though, derides those harsh sanctions, saying they are more of the failed idea that harsh sanctions will deter drug sales, when instead they’ll only result in harsh sentences.</p>
<p>“Drug war proponents have been repeating the deterrence mantra for over 40 years, and yet drugs are cheaper, stronger, and more widely available than at any other time in US history,” the alliance wrote.</p>
<p>The report’s authors also warn that people may not seek assistance for someone suffering an overdose if they fear prosecution.</p>
<p>“People positioned to save lives are unlikely to call 911 if they fear being charged with murder or manslaughter,” the alliance wrote.</p>

<p>This is the last story in a five-part series, produced in collaboration with APM Reports, examining the case of Curtis Flowers. This series is adapted from “In the Dark,” an investigative podcast by APM Reports.</p>
<p>One day in 2001, Jeffrey Armstrong was at his mother’s house on the east side of Winona when he heard his dog barking in the backyard. He walked out and saw that the dog had dug up something from under the house.</p>
<p>It was a gun — a .380 automatic, rusting and dirty on one side. Armstrong immediately thought of the Tardy Furniture murders five years earlier, a crime for which Curtis Flowers had been convicted and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Armstrong knew that the gun used to shoot the four Tardy employees on July 16, 1996, was a .380, and that the murder weapon had never been found. He gave the gun to investigators. Then, he says, it disappeared.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have said that Flowers was the only serious suspect from the beginning of the case. But a yearlong investigation by APM Reports has found compelling evidence that points away from Flowers.</p>
<p>APM Reports recently interviewed a man named Willie James Hemphill, who said he was a suspect early in the investigation. And the gun that Armstrong says he discovered is additionally important because of where it was found — in the opposite direction from where the prosecution claims Flowers fled from Tardy Furniture. If the gun is the murder weapon, it indicates that perhaps someone else committed the crime.</p>
<p>The revelations are among a number of discoveries by APM Reports journalists investigating the 22-year-old case. Previous stories have reported that there’s no direct evidence against Flowers, including no reliable evidence placing him near the scene or linking him to the murder weapon. Moreover, all three jailhouse informants who testified against Flowers have recanted, one directly to a reporter.</p>
<p>A gun found on an alternate escape route</p>
<p>The question of what happened to the .380 lingers.</p>
<p>Armstrong says he turned the gun over to the Winona Police Department. Police Chief Tommy Bibbs and Dan Herod, the department’s chief investigator, told APM Reports that Armstrong had turned in a gun. They said the pistol was sent to the district attorney’s office for testing by the Mississippi crime lab.</p>
<p>The state crime lab told APM Reports that it has no record of receiving the gun. It’s not clear if the gun was tested or whether it’s the murder weapon.</p>
<p>“They’ll never know the whole truth,” said Armstrong, who’s long believed that Flowers is innocent. “This thing has been a mess since the day it happened.”</p>
<p>District Attorney Doug Evans has refused to answer specific questions from APM Reports about evidence in the Flowers case.</p>
<p>In 2016, Flowers’ defense team asked a state judge to order prosecutors to produce the gun for testing. At the hearing, Evans and a lawyer with the Mississippi Attorney General’s office assisting on the case denied that prosecutors had the gun. The judge ruled against the defense. The gun’s present whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>If the gun was the murder weapon, it could have undermined the case against Flowers. The gun, said Armstrong, was found just 700 feet east of Tardy Furniture. That’s the opposite direction that prosecutors say Flowers fled.</p>
<p>On June 14, 2010, in Greenwood, during Curtis Flowers’ sixth trial for the Tardy Furniture murders, Clemmie Flemming points out to prosecutor Doug Evans, center, where she spotted Flowers on the morning of the Winona slayings on July 16, 1996.</p>
<p>(Photo: File Photo/The Greenwood Commonwealth via AP)</p>
<p>One key prosecution witness said she saw Flowers running west from the store not long after the murders, though other witnesses later questioned the veracity of her claims.</p>
<p>East of Tardy Furniture — a direction an assailant could have traversed within minutes of committing the crime — there’s a direct path from the store to where the gun was found. Moreover, the path includes a drainage tunnel under railroad tracks leading to a drainage ditch, all of which could have allowed the shooter to escape largely unseen.</p>
<p>Men with criminal histories lived just a few blocks from where the gun was found. That includes Hemphill, who lived in the neighborhood on and off during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Hemphill questioned for hours, jailed</p>
<p>As the Clarion Ledger previously reported, the APM Reports investigation found evidence that investigators considered Hemphill a suspect in the days after the Tardy Furniture murders.</p>
<p>The investigative file compiled in Flowers’ case contained only one mention of Hemphill —- the document he signed waiving his Miranda rights before questioning.</p>
<p>Flowers’ attorneys asked investigators about Hemphill briefly during the sixth trial in June 2010. Investigators said they quickly eliminated him as a suspect.</p>
<p>“I think they talked to him for five minutes, I don’t think they learned anything,” John Johnson, an investigator for the DA’s office, testified. It wasn’t clear exactly why investigators ruled Hemphill out.</p>
<p>It took APM Reports months to track down Hemphill, but when reporters found him — at a courthouse in Indianapolis — he said he was questioned for two or three hours about the murders and that his statements were tape recorded.</p>
<p>No documents or transcripts about Hemphill’s questioning were turned over to the defense. Legal experts say that prosecutors are usually required to turn over to the defense information about alternative suspects.</p>
<p>Told by reporters that investigators said they only questioned him for five minutes, Hemphill said: “It was definitely more than five minutes that they talked to me. It took five minutes to read me my Miranda rights and have me sign papers and set up the recording, the tape recorder. That takes five minutes.”</p>
<p>He said investigators were very interested in his shoes. He wore Grant Hill Fila sneakers in size 9 or 10 — the same kind of shoe that left the bloody shoe print at the murder scene.</p>
<p>Hemphill told APM Reports that he was shopping at a mall in Memphis at the time of the murders. His alibi witness didn’t return calls.</p>
<p>County records uncovered by APM Reports show that Hemphill was booked into jail after his questioning in 1996 and that he remained in jail for 11 days.</p>
<p>After Hemphill’s release, the investigation remained focused on Flowers. Regardless of why investigators ruled out Hemphill, if he was a serious suspect and if the prosecution didn’t turn over that information to Flowers’ defense, it might endanger the conviction, legal experts say.</p>
<p>In a motion filed in the weeks since the release of the “In the Dark” podcast, Flowers’ defense team cited the Hemphill revelations as a reason the court should move forward with the latest appeal. The lawyers termed it “stunning new evidence that has come to light.”</p>
<p>While his appeals continue, Flowers remains on death row. He will soon have spent more than half his life in prison.</p>

<p>On the night of Graduation 2018 for a lot of local high schools, teens were out in force celebrating their new steps in life and education.</p>
<p>While some feel like marijuana should be legal, it still isn’t in Mississippi, so police are still required to confiscate it and ticket or arrest you if you’re in possession, depending on the jurisdiction and the agency.</p>
<p>This year a multi-agency detail was in operation in violent crime areas on the streets of Jackson, and federal, state and local authorities were out in force.</p>
<p>And as you may have learned before in previous #BehindTheScenesJPD episodes, your pants are not a safe place to store your drugs. Authorities can legally search your pants for drugs, weapons, and other contraband.</p>
<p>It’s better to just tell them what’s in your pants.</p>

<p>IUKA, Miss. — A northeast Mississippi man who was already jailed now faces five felony charges for threatening city and county officials.</p>
<p>Brandon Adam Pendergrass of Iuka was in the Tishomingo County Jail when he threatened to inflict bodily harm on all five county supervisors as well as the Iuka municipal judge when he was released from custody.</p>
<p>Tishomingo County Sheriff John Daugherty tells local news outlets the threats were treated as a serious incident. The 29-year-old Pendergrass was charged with five counts of simple assault on a public official.</p>
<p>During his initial appearance in justice court on the new charges, bail was set at $200,000. Pendergrass is currently on probation with the Mississippi Department of Corrections for another conviction.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if Pendergrass has an attorney to speak for him.</p>

<p>The Miami-Dade Police Department must return nearly $20,000 in cash to a woman after prosecutors admitted that officers illegally searched her car and seized several lawfully owned guns.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald reports that the department will also pay $3,000 in legal fees to Lizmixell Batista, a dancer at the local Cheetah Gentleman’s Club, and her husband, Ras Cates. The case is textbook example of how asset forfeiture laws and the drug war incentivize constitutional violations and bad police work.</p>
<p>Batista and Cates were arrested following a traffic stop in May. Police allegedly smelled marijuana in their car, and a subsequent search turned up six guns, several large bottles of what cops suspected to be codeine cough syrup, and nearly $20,000 in cash in Batista’s purse.</p>
<p>At the time, police touted it as a major bust. CBS Miami ran an “exclusive” story about the “arsenal of weapons, cash and illegal drugs”:</p>
<p>“It’s amazing how something as simple as a traffic stop can lead us to crack a lot of cases,” said Miami-Dade Police Detective Alvaro Zabaleta. “A lot of serial killers are behind bars because of traffic stops. These traffic stops lead to so many things in the criminal world and they are never routine. We warn our officers that there is no such thing as a routine traffic stop. You never know what you are going to get.”</p>
<p>Just like life, and boxes of chocolate. But for police, what looked like a delicious nougat of a drug bust turned out to be the coconut cream of disappointment.</p>
<p>Prosecutors dropped the charges against Batista and Cates when body-cam footage showed police didn’t have permission to search the couple’s trunk. The guns were all legally owned, Cates had a concealed carry license, and no testing had been done on the suspected codeine or hash oil to determine if they were illicit drugs.</p>
<p>“What is most disturbing is that immediately following the arrest, the department went on TV and engaged in incendiary speculation without knowing the facts or even acknowledging the rampant violations of my clients’ constitutional rights,” defense attorney Jude Faccidomo tells the Herald.</p>
<p>But there was still that sweet, sweet cash. Under civil asset forfeiture laws, the department could still claim it even though there were no longer any criminal charges against Batista.</p>
<p>Batista had explained to officers why, given her profession, she would be carrying large amounts of cash, but the department initiated a forfeiture case against the money anyway. The Herald reports:</p>
<p>The Miami-Dade police department’s legal bureau, suspecting it was dope money, asked a civil-court judge to allow the department to keep the $19,934 seized in the car. The department said a Miami-Dade police dog, Roxie, alerted that the cash had been “in close proximity” to large amounts of narcotics.</p>
<p>But at the hearing, a fellow stripper named Haley Heath testified that her friend, Batista, earned “significant cash tips” at the Cheetah club.</p>
<p>“I felt that the glitter on the seized cash was compelling evidence, but apparently the police department disagreed,” said defense lawyer Jude Faccidomo.</p>
<p>The judge agreed with Faccidomo and ordered the cash to be returned.</p>

<p>Joshua Roberts / Reuters</p>
<p>Associate Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer</p>
<p>Justice Stephen Breyer hasn’t given up on working to convince his colleagues — or America — that the time has come to reconsider the constitutionality of the death penalty.</p>
<p>“In my view,” Breyer wrote last week in disagreeing with the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear the appeals of two inmates on Mississippi’s death row, “many of the capital cases that come before this Court … involve, like the cases of Richard Jordan and Timothy Evans, special problems of cruelty or arbitrariness.” As such, he wrote that he “remain[s] of the view” that the court should take a case to “consider whether the death penalty as currently administered violates the Constitution’s Eighth Amendment,” which bars cruel and unusual punishments.</p>
<p>Breyer made the statement even as the court and country were taking in the news that Justice Anthony Kennedy, the key vote over the past two decades in cases seeking to curb uses of the death penalty, would be retiring at the end of July. Kennedy sided with the more liberal justices in several key cases limiting who is eligible for the death penalty, but regularly joined his more conservative colleagues in rejecting challenges to the method of execution a state chose to use.</p>
<p>While most liberals across the country were writing out their concerns about how the court’s close decisions that went to the left could be reversed under a more conservative court, Breyer was putting the final touches on his dissent regarding Jordan’s and Evans’ petitions. It was not, however, a cry of defeat or even a plea from the losing side of a battle. Far from that, his statement on the day after Kennedy announced his retirement was written in a way that suggested Breyer continues to believe, at least outwardly, that he can win over his colleagues to take up the question and end the death penalty.</p>
<p>Three years earlier, Breyer began this effort, writing a lengthy dissent in a death penalty case out of Oklahoma, Glossip v. Gross.</p>
<p>In the dissent, Breyer noted that the court had previously declared that the finality of the death penalty creates a heightened “need for reliability” in decisions that death is “the appropriate punishment” in any particular case. “There is increasing evidence, however, that the death penalty as now applied lacks that requisite reliability,” he wrote, in an opinion joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p>
<p>The unreliability question was one of three areas that Breyer spent 40 pages addressing. The second — arbitrariness — focused on data showing that the death penalty does not punish “the worst of the worst,” as intended, and that a “county-by-county disparity” exists, resulting in most death sentences across the country being imposed in a small handful of counties. The final area — “in part a problem that the Constitution’s own demands create,” Breyer acknowledged — is excessive delays that Breyer, like retired Justice John Paul Stevens before him, believes lead to “a third independent constitutional problem.”</p>
<p>For these reasons, Breyer concluded, “I believe it highly likely that the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment.” He, with support from Ginsburg, called for a “full briefing” on that “more basic question.”</p>
<p>In the three years since Breyer’s Glossip dissent, the court has trudged a complicated path on the death penalty — repeatedly refusing death row inmates’ requests for the court to take up that more basic question but halting a handful of executions and at times reversing individual death sentences or specific states’ procedures due to particularly egregious circumstances.</p>
<p>In those times when death row inmates have succeeded before the Supreme Court over the past few years — and particularly relevant now — Chief Justice John Roberts often has joined with Kennedy and the four more liberal justices in the majority.</p>
<p>Throughout that time, though, Breyer regularly has weighed in to remind his colleagues of the broader path he recommends. And while some advocates were pressing for a quick resolution — bringing cases to the court regularly that posed the question — Breyer has not taken the fact that the court has not done so as a sign that he should give up the effort. Rather than issuing a dissent declaring — as others have done before him — that he is done voting to allow any executions to proceed, he instead is continuing to take each case separately and highlight those that allow him to marshal additional facts to support his long-term effort.</p>
<p>In the January after his Glossip dissent, Breyer noted in a case out of Alabama that the “unfairness inherent” in treating similar cases differently because of how they arrive at the justices “only underscores the need to reconsider the validity of capital punishment under the Eighth Amendment.”</p>
<p>Less than a month later, Justice Antonin Scalia unexpectedly died and, for a time, it seemed that those aggressive advocates might have a path ahead. A liberal court likely was ascending, it appeared — until it wasn’t.</p>
<p>In the days before the 2016 election, the eight-justice court granted a stay of execution for an Alabama man, with Roberts joining the more liberal justices as a “courtesy” to allow them time to consider the inmate’s request. A month after President Donald Trump’s unexpected victory, however, the court split 4–4 on a stay request — Roberts did not provide the “courtesy” fifth vote for a stay that time — and the execution proceeded.</p>
<p>Trump’s election did not, however, appear to change Breyer’s efforts. In early 2017, he highlighted his geographic concerns in a case the justices declined to hear — noting in dissent that the case had come to the justices from Caddo Parish in Louisiana, “a county that in recent history has apparently sentenced more people to death per capita than any other county in the United States.”</p>
<p>The addition of Justice Neil Gorsuch to the court, as well, did not lead to a change in Breyer’s “steady ahead” approach.</p>
<p>In another case where the court was constrained from reviewing the inmate’s claims due to limits on federal review of state criminal convictions, Breyer, in November 2017, reiterated his concerns about how the length of time people spend on death row creates new problems in a case in which the inmate “lived nearly half of his life on death row.”</p>
<p>Noting how many death row inmates facing execution are now older or even elderly, Breyer wrote of the practical concerns: “Rather than develop a constitutional jurisprudence that focuses upon the special circumstances of the aged, however, I believe it would be wiser to reconsider the root cause of the problem — the constitutionality of the death penalty itself.”</p>
<p>In March of this year, Breyer — joined by all three of his liberal colleagues — detailed the ways in which Arizona’s death penalty law, which includes so many circumstances as “aggravating factors” that almost all people convicted of murder are eligible for the death penalty, raises “an important Eighth Amendment question.”</p>
<p>The statement didn’t raise the broader question of whether the death penalty is ever constitutional. Instead, it focused on that “narrowing requirement” and included a request to get more “empirical evidence,” as Breyer put it, before the court on the issue. With four justices on board, enough to have granted the case if they desired to do so, the side-stepping statement appeared to be an effort to get lawyers to make a stronger evidentiary argument advancing the arbitrariness concerns that Breyer detailed in his Glossip dissent before having the full court hear — and vote on — the arguments on the issue.</p>

<p>All of which comes to Breyer’s dissent June 28, the day after Kennedy announced his retirement. Far from backing off on his Glossip dissent, it is, instead, Glossip 2.0 — a sign that Breyer plans to continue pressing ahead, perhaps with the goal of convincing Roberts — or Kennedy’s eventual successor — of his position.</p>
<p>From the start, Breyer noted his Glossip dissent and its focus on, in his view, the “unconscionably long delays, arbitrary application, and serious unreliability” of the death penalty in the US.</p>
<p>Evans and Jordan’s cases out of Mississippi, he continued, “illustrate the first two of these problems.” He added that he also was writing “to highlight additional evidence” about the third problem.</p>
<p>Jordan, Breyer wrote, was sentenced to death “nearly 42 years ago,” living “more than half of his life on death row” — “one among an aging population of death row inmates.”</p>
<p>Both men were sentenced to death in the same judicial district in Mississippi, the district that Evans told the court “accounts for ‘the largest number of death sentences of any of the State’s 22 districts since 1976.” This geographic concern, Breyer continued, is stark, citing data showing that there were only “16 counties, or 0.5% of all counties nationwide, in which five or more death sentences were imposed from 2010 to 2015.” Reciting data about the reduced number of executions and new death sentences across the country, Breyer concluded that “the death penalty may eventually disappear.” Regardless of that possibility, though, he wrote that such information “also shows that capital punishment is ‘unusual’ (as well as ‘cruel’).”</p>
<p>Adding one last note to the opinion — regarding the reliability factor — Breyer cited a Mississippi death row inmate who was exonerated in 2015, Willie Manning, and noted that six others across the nation have been exonerated since January 2017.</p>
<p>“Among them,” he wrote, “are Rodricus Crawford, Rickey Dale Newman, Gabriel Solache, and Vicente Benavides Figueroa, whose exonerations were based upon evidence of actual innocence.”</p>

<h2><a class="How_to_Find_Out_About_Hot_Dogs_Puppy_Names_and_Parking_Tickets_12160"></a>How to Find Out About Hot Dogs, Puppy Names and Parking Tickets</h2>
<p class="byline">by: Sandhya Kambhampati</p>
<p class="date">2018-07-11</p>
<p class="source">url: <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/ask-propublica-illinois-freedom-of-information-act-foia-requests-documents">https://www.propublica.org/article/ask-propublica-illinois-freedom-of-information-act-foia-requests-documents</a></p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, we asked ProPublica Illinois readers what they wanted to know about how we do our work. Thoughtful, challenging questions have been rolling in ever since, and we’ve been answering them in an occasional series of columns. In this dispatch, data reporter Sandhya Kambhampati answers a question about the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
<p>What is the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)? What kind of documents can you request using the FOIA? Have there been any attacks on the FOIA in recent years? If so, what are they? —Rachel Lietz</p>
<p>The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) allows anyone — not just journalists — to request records from the government or any public agency. Getting records through FOIA is crucial, and it has been a boon for reporters. It helps us keep a close eye on what the government is doing and to hold people in power accountable.</p>
<p>Say you got sick after eating at a hot dog stand at Wrigley Field. Well, you can file a FOIA for the restaurant’s inspection reports from the Chicago Department of Health. Interested in what route garbage trucks take? Request a map from the Chicago Department of Streets and Sanitation.</p>
<p>Other documents you can request include, but are not limited to*: budgets, PowerPoint presentations and audio/visual training materials, calendars, meeting minutes and email.</p>
<p>*See what I did there — helpful language to use if you want to file your own FOIA.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of ProPublica Illinois stories that FOIA helped make possible:</p>
<pre><code>•   Jodi Cohen requested a copy of a $3 million check the University of Illinois at Chicago sent to the National Institutes of Health. Through this FOIA and many others that followed, Jodi unraveled the story of a psychiatrist at UIC who violated research protocols and put children at risk.

•   Mick Dumke requested Chicago’s gang database and found it was riddled with errors.

•   Melissa Sanchez filed requests with the City of Chicago finance department on tickets, and found, among other facts, that Chicago has issued 20,000 duplicate city sticker tickets since 2007.
</code></pre>
<p>There are all sorts of unexpected, even fun, ways to use FOIA. WBEZ reporter Elliott Ramos found out which Chicago neighborhood had the most block parties. He requested applications for block parties from the Chicago Department of Transportation. Curious about the most popular dog names? Block Club Chicago took a look at the dogs of the Windy City, using pet application data from City Clerk’s office.</p>
<p>You can request data in different formats: Excel (xlsx), text files (.txt), or comma-separated values (CSV) format or databases (SQL, Access), although agencies love to keep us on our feet by printing out Excel files and sending the requested records back in a PDF form. PDFs are the worst because you have to convert them back to Excel to calculate data or enter it by hand. I frequently file requests with government agencies to get data to combine with other datasets readily available online, such as matching census data on income to parking tickets. I’ve written previously about the thousands of requests I’ve sent out and some tips I have for the long, sometimes painful process that comes along with sending record requests.</p>
<p>To be successful, it helps to understand the various federal, state and local FOIA laws. Under FOIA, agencies are not required to “create” records for you, and they must already possess the materials you want. This is where it’s helpful to be specific so the agency can easily determine what records you’re requesting. There’s a little science to writing a request and figuring out the specificity a given agency requires. It also helps to have a conversation with a person at an agency before you send off your request, so you know the right words to use. Some agencies have certain words that trigger a denial. For example, “everything” will probably get you a rejection.</p>
<p>Some exemptions allow government agencies to withhold documents. These include law enforcement records that could interfere with an open case, trade secrets, preliminary drafts or personal information, such as Social Security numbers that, if disclosed, would be an invasion of someone’s privacy. An agency can also label someone a “recurrent requester” if they submit 50 or more requests to the same public body in one year, 15 requests in 30 days, or seven within a 7-day period, which enables the agency to turn down their requests. (This label cannot be used for reporters.)</p>
<p>As valuable as FOIA is for reporters, agencies often resist releasing records. Some agencies, it seems, routinely deny requests in hopes the requester will simply go away. Others say a request will take an exceedingly long time to fulfill. And in what has become a common refrain, agencies will claim a request is unduly burdensome. That means the burden on the public body to produce the records outweighs the public’s interest in the information.</p>
<p>According to an analysis done by the Associated Press, the federal government withheld or censored records more often last year than at any other time over the past decade. The AP also found the federal government spent $40.6 million last year in legal fees to withhold files.</p>
<p>In Illinois, there’s an appeals process if you believe your request has been incorrectly denied. You can request review from the Illinois Attorney General’s Public Access Counselor (PAC), which helps resolve issues involving open records requests.</p>
<p>Last year, there were an average of 324 requests for review per month, according to the Public Access Counselor, giving some indication how common denials are throughout the state. The PAC issues a ruling on each request for review but some of these decisions are non-binding, so the agencies don’t have to follow them.</p>
<p>As journalists — and as citizens — we need FOIA to hold our government and public bodies accountable. We’ll keep filing requests here at ProPublica Illinois and, to paraphrase the Beastie Boys, you should fight for your right to FOIA, too.</p>

<p>ProPublica announced today that Jack Gillum is joining its staff as a senior reporter covering technology and the ways algorithms, big data and social media platforms impact civil rights. He starts on July 30.</p>
<p>Gillum comes to ProPublica from The Washington Post, where he was part of the investigative team for the past year digging into topics ranging from mismanaged taxpayer funds to troubled relief efforts in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>Prior to the Post, Gillum was a reporter in the D.C. investigative unit at The Associated Press. During his six years there, he broke stories on the existence and location of Hillary Clinton’s private email server, as well as a secretive, U.S.-backed “Cuban Twitter” program that mined subscriber data for political purposes. He was also the recipient of the John L. Dougherty Award for exemplary work by an AP staff member under the age of 30.</p>
<p>Gillum began his career as a business reporter and database specialist at the Arizona Daily Star in Tucson, his hometown, covering technology and aerospace firms. Later as a database editor for USA Today, Gillum helped expose rampant cheating in D.C.’s public school system under then-chancellor Michelle Rhee for the paper’s “Testing the System” series, which won an Education Writers Association Award.</p>
<p>“Time and again, Jack has proven to be a formidable reporter with the tenacity and skill set to do some of the industry’s most ambitious journalism,” said ProPublica managing editor Robin Fields. “We’re confident he’ll be a great addition to our newsroom as we advance our coverage of technology and its impact on our lives.”</p>
<p>“Technology’s underlying moral and civil rights issues stand to be one of the most important stories of our time,” said Gillum. “I’m thrilled to be joining such a talented newsroom of investigative reporters and editors who have already begun exposing areas of algorithmic injustice.”</p>

<h2><a class="How_ProPublica_Illinois_Uses_GNU_Make_to_Load_14GB_of_Data_Every_Day_12230"></a>How ProPublica Illinois Uses GNU Make to Load 1.4GB of Data Every Day</h2>
<p class="byline">by: David Eads</p>
<p class="date">2018-07-09</p>
<p class="source">url: <a href="https://www.propublica.org/nerds/gnu-make-illinois-campaign-finance-data-david-eads-propublica-illinois">https://www.propublica.org/nerds/gnu-make-illinois-campaign-finance-data-david-eads-propublica-illinois</a></p>
<p>The Money Game</p>
<p>I avoided using GNU Make in my data journalism work for a long time, partly because the documentation was so obtuse that I couldn’t see how Make, one of many extract-transform-load (ETL) processes, could help my day-to-day data reporting. But this year, to build The Money Game, I needed to load 1.4GB of Illinois political contribution and spending data every day, and the ETL process was taking hours, so I gave Make another chance.</p>
<p>Now the same process takes less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Here’s how it all works, but if you want to skip directly to the code, we’ve open-sourced it here.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Make lets you say:</p>
<pre><code>•   File X depends on a transformation applied to file Y 

•   If file X doesn’t exist, apply that transformation to file Y and make file X
</code></pre>
<p>This “start with file Y to get file X” pattern is a daily reality of data journalism, and using Make to load political contribution and spending data was a great use case. The data is fairly large, accessed via a slow FTP server, has a quirky format, has just enough integrity issues to keep things interesting, and needs to be compatible with a legacy codebase. To tackle it, I needed to start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>The financial disclosure data we’re using is from the Illinois State Board of Elections, but the Illinois Sunshine project had released open source code (no longer available) to handle the ETL process and fundraising calculations. Using their code, the ETL process took about two hours to run on robust hardware and over five hours on our servers, where it would sometimes fail for reasons I never quite understood. I needed it to work better and work faster.</p>
<p>The process looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>•   Download data files via FTP from Illinois State Board Of Elections.

•   Clean the data using Python to resolve integrity issues and create clean versions of the data files.

•   Load the clean data into PostgreSQL using its highly efficient but finicky “\copy” command.

•   Transform the data in the database to clean up column names and provide more immediately useful forms of the data using “raw” and “public” PostgreSQL schemas and materialized views (essentially persistently cached versions of standard SQL views).
</code></pre>
<p>The cleaning step must happen before any data is loaded into the database, so we can take advantage of PostgreSQL’s efficient import tools. If a single row has a string in a column where it’s expecting an integer, the whole operation fails.</p>
<p>GNU Make is well-suited to this task. Make’s model is built around describing the output files your ETL process should produce and the operations required to go from a set of original source files to a set of output files.</p>
<p>As with any ETL process, the goal is to preserve your original data, keep operations atomic and provide a simple and repeatable process that can be run over and over.</p>
<p>Let’s examine a few of the steps:</p>
<p>Download and Pre-import Cleaning</p>
<p>Take a look at this snippet, which could be a standalone Makefile:</p>
<p>data/download/%.txt :</p>
<p>aria2c -x5 -q -d data/download --ftp-user=&quot;$(ILCAMPAIGNCASH_FTP_USER)&quot; --ftp-passwd=&quot;$(ILCAMPAIGNCASH_FTP_PASSWD)&quot;</p>
<p><a href="ftp://ftp.elections.il.gov/CampDisclDataFiles/$*.txt">ftp://ftp.elections.il.gov/CampDisclDataFiles/$*.txt</a></p>
<p>data/processed/%.csv : data/download/%.txt</p>
<p>python processors/clean_isboe_tsv.py $&lt; $* &gt; $@</p>
<p>This snippet first downloads a file via FTP and then uses Python to process it. For example, if “Expenditures.txt” is one of my source data files, I can run make data/processed/Expenditures.csv to download and process the expenditure data.</p>
<p>There are two things to note here.</p>
<p>The first is that we use Aria2 to handle FTP duties. Earlier versions of the script used other FTP clients that were either slow as molasses or painful to use. After some trial and error, I found Aria2 did the job better than lftp (which is fast but fussy) or good old ftp (which is both slow and fussy). I also found some incantations that took download times from roughly an hour to less than 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Second, the cleaning step is crucial for this dataset. It uses a simple class-based Python validation scheme you can see here. The important thing to note is that while Python is pretty slow generally, Python 3 is fast enough for this. And as long as you are only processing row-by-row without any objects accumulating in memory or doing any extra disk writes, performance is fine, even on low-resource machines like the servers in ProPublica’s cluster, and there aren’t any unexpected quirks.</p>
<p>Loading</p>
<p>Make is built around file inputs and outputs. But what happens if our data is both in files and database tables? Here are a few valuable tricks I learned for integrating database tables into Makefiles:</p>
<p>One SQL file per table / transform: Make loves both files and simple mappings, so I created individual files with the schema definitions for each table or any other atomic table-level operation. The table names match the SQL filenames, the SQL filenames match the source data filenames. You can see them here.</p>
<p>Use exit code magic to make tables look like files to Make: Hannah Cushman and Forrest Gregg from DataMade introduced me to this trick on Twitter. Make can be fooled into treating tables like files if you prefix table level commands with commands that emit appropriate exit codes. If a table exists, emit a successful code. If it doesn’t, emit an error.</p>
<p>Beyond that, loading consists solely of the highly efficient PostgreSQL \copy command. While the COPY command is even more efficient, it doesn’t play nicely with Amazon RDS. Even if ProPublica moved to a different database provider, I’d continue to use \copy for portability unless eking out a little more performance was mission-critical.</p>
<p>There’s one last curveball: The loading step imports data to a PostgreSQL schema called raw so that we can cleanly transform the data further. Postgres schemas provide a useful way of segmenting data within a single database — instead of a single namespace with tables like raw_contributions and clean_contributions, you can keep things simple and clear with an almost folder-like structure of raw.contributions and public.contributions.</p>
<p>Post-import Transformations</p>
<p>The Illinois Sunshine code also renames columns and slightly reshapes the data for usability and performance reasons. Column aliasing is useful for end users and the intermediate tables are required for compatibility with the legacy code.</p>
<p>In this case, the loader imports into a schema called raw that is as close to the source data as humanly possible.</p>
<p>The data is then transformed by creating materialized views of the raw tables that rename columns and handle some light post-processing. This is enough for our purposes, but more elaborate transformations could be applied without sacrificing clarity or obscuring the source data. Here’s a snippet of one of these view definitions:</p>
<p>CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW d2_reports AS</p>
<pre><code>SELECT

    id as id,

    committeeid as committee_id,

    fileddocid as filed_doc_id,

    begfundsavail as beginning_funds_avail,

    indivcontribi as individual_itemized_contrib,

    indivcontribni as individual_non_itemized_contrib,

    xferini as transfer_in_itemized,

    xferinni as transfer_in_non_itemized,

    # ….

FROM raw.d2totals
</code></pre>
<p>WITH DATA;</p>
<p>These transformations are very simple, but simply using more readable column names is a big improvement for end-users.</p>
<p>As with table schema definitions, there is a file for each table that describes the transformed view. We use materialized views, which, again, are essentially persistently cached versions of standard SQL views, because storage is cheap and they are faster than traditional SQL views.</p>
<p>You’ll notice we use environment variables that are expanded inline when the commands are run. That’s useful for debugging and helps with portability. But it’s not a good idea if you think log files or terminal output could be compromised or people who shouldn’t know these secrets have access to logs or shared systems. For more security, you could use a system like the PostgreSQL pgconf file and remove the environment variable references.</p>
<p>My only prior experience with Make was in a computational math course 15 years ago, where it was a frustrating and poorly explained footnote. The combination of obtuse documentation, my bad experience in school and an already reliable framework kept me away. Plus, my shell scripts and Python Fabric/Invoke code were doing a fine job building reliable data processing pipelines based on the same principles for the smaller, quick turnaround projects I was doing.</p>
<p>But after trying Make for this project, I was more than impressed with the results. It’s concise and expressive. It enforces atomic operations, but rewards them with dead simple ways to handle partial builds, which is a big deal during development when you really don’t want to be repeating expensive operations to test individual components. Combined with PostgreSQL’s speedy import tools, schemas, and materialized views, I was able to load the data in a fraction of the time. And just as important, the performance of the new process is less sensitive to varying system resources.</p>
<p>If you’re itching to get started with Make, here are a few additional resources:</p>
<pre><code>•   “Practical Makefiles, by example” by John Tsiombikas is a nice resource if you want to dig deeper, but Make’s documentation is intimidating.
</code></pre>
<p>In the end, the best build/processing system is any system that never alters source data, clearly shows transformations, uses version control and can be easily run over and over. Grunt, Gulp, Rake, Make, Invoke … you have options. As long as you like what you use and use it religiously, your work will benefit.</p>

<p>Brett Kavanaugh testifies during a second Senate Judiciary confirmation hearing on May 9, 2006.</p>
<p>President Trump on Monday night nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the seat on the U.S. Supreme Court that Justice Anthony Kennedy will vacate at the end of the month. Kavanaugh is a judge on the powerful U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Below, we’ve gathered some of the best reporting on Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>Did we miss anything? Leave a link in the comments or tweet to us with #scotusnominee.</p>
<p>Potential Nominee Profile: Brett Kavanaugh</p>
<p>SCOTUSblog, June 2018</p>
<p>SCOTUSblog’s profile of Kavanaugh provides a comprehensive summary of the judge’s background, from his upbringing in the Washington area to his college and law school years at Yale to his prestigious positions in various parts of the federal government. As the profile notes, Kavanaugh was a law clerk for Kennedy, whom he has been nominated to replace. The piece offers a highlight reel of Kavanaugh’s time on the federal appeals court in Washington. Ultimately, the article concludes, Kavanaugh “brings a pragmatic approach to judging,” albeit with a serious conservative bent.</p>
<p>Brett Kavanaugh, a Conservative Stalwart in Political Fights and on the Bench</p>
<p>New York Times, July 2018</p>
<p>The New York Times’ Adam Liptak examines Kavanaugh’s personal and professional history. The profile depicts Kavanaugh as a decidedly conservative Washington insider but hardly a rank partisan. He’s known as a nuanced and careful thinker, and although his judicial opinions are often lauded by voices on the right, he has shied away from absolutist positions, at times to the chagrin of conservatives. He has “formed lifelong friendships with liberals, many of whom praise his intellect and civility,” and those who worked with him before he became a judge described him as “often a moderating force.”</p>
<p>Kavanaugh Paper Chase Threatens to Draw Out Confirmation Battle</p>
<p>Politico, July 2018</p>
<p>Kavanaugh’s nomination “presents a band of government archivists and White House officials with a herculean task: wading through what could be millions of pages of records” ahead of his confirmation hearings. The paper trail leads back to the two years Kavanaugh spent in Bush’s White House Counsel’s Office and another three years he spent as Bush’s staff secretary. Politico’s Josh Gerstein takes a look at how the extensive documentation of Kavanaugh’s executive branch career could slow the judge’s confirmation process.</p>
<p>Trump’s Supreme Court Frontrunner Is the “Forrest Gump of Republican Politics”</p>
<p>Mother Jones, June 2018</p>
<p>This Mother Jones profile casts Kavanaugh as a consummate insider of the D.C. conservative establishment who “frequently inserted himself into high-profile political battles.” Kavanaugh worked on the team of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky. He represented the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez in a high-profile immigration dispute in 2000, in which they sought to keep the Cuban boy in the United States. He worked on George W. Bush’s legal team during the contentious 2000 presidential election recount in Florida — and went on to oversee judicial nominations in Bush’s White House Counsel’s Office. His ubiquity earned him the nickname the “Forrest Gump of Republican politics.”</p>
<p>How Four Potential Nominees Would Change the Supreme Court</p>
<p>FiveThirtyEight, July 2018</p>
<p>FiveThirtyEight draws on a tool to measure judicial ideology developed by legal scholars and political scientists to assess Kavanaugh’s potential effect on the Supreme Court’s jurisprudential makeup. The conclusion: a Justice Kavanaugh “would likely represent a reliably conservative voice and vote on the high court”—“to the right of Gorsuch and Justice Samuel Alito, and just to the left of the arch conservative Justice Clarence Thomas.” That would leave Chief Justice John Roberts as the “new median justice.” FiveThirtyEight adds a caveat, however, about the metric it’s relying on: it’s based on the ideology of the politicians who nominated a judge—in this case, Bush—rather than the judge’s rulings.</p>
<p>Brett Kavanaugh, Supreme Court Front-Runner, Once Argued Broad Grounds for Impeachment</p>
<p>The New York Times, July 2018</p>
<p>The Times’ Mark Landler and Matt Apuzzo take a look at Kavanaugh’s time on Starr’s team — and its implications for Trump. Starr’s report as independent counsel, which Kavanaugh co-wrote, argues that lying to staff members and misleading the public are grounds to impeach a president for obstruction of justice. That “broad definition of obstruction of justice,” Landler and Apuzzo write, “would be damaging if applied to President Trump in the Russia investigation.”</p>
<p>Top Supreme Court Prospect Has Argued Presidents Should Not Be Distracted by Investigations and Lawsuits</p>
<p>The Washington Post, June 2018</p>
<p>The Washington Post examines a 2009 law review article in which Kavanaugh argued that a sitting president shouldn’t have to deal with “time-consuming and distracting” lawsuits and investigations. The distraction “would ill serve the public interest, especially in times of financial or national security crisis,” Kavanaugh wrote. That, the Post notes, “puts him on the record regarding a topic of intense interest to Trump — and could be a central focus of his confirmation hearing.”</p>
<p>Holding Court</p>
<p>The New Yorker, March 2012</p>
<p>In this comment, Jeffrey Toobin describes Kavanaugh as a judge in thrall to partisan politics. Toobin characterizes Kavanaugh’s work as an appeals judge as “startling.” He accuses Kavanaugh of “pandering to the base” in a dissenting opinion he wrote in a case challenging Obamacare. Kavanaugh “appeared to offer some advice to the Republicans who are challenging Obama in the election,” Toobin wrote — whatever courts hold, a Republican president could simply decline to enforce the health-care law because he deems it unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Leading Contender to Be Trump’s Supreme Court Pick Faces Questions from Social Conservatives</p>
<p>The Washington Post, July 2018</p>
<p>The Washington Post’s Robert Acosta and Josh Dawsey survey conservative misgivings about Kavanaugh’s record on the federal appeals court in Washington. Where Toobin saw Kavanaugh as a right-wing partisan, many social conservatives fear he’s not enough of a hardliner. The conservative response to the White House floating Kavanaugh’s name included “a clamor from those who see him as out of step on health care and abortion, or too tied to George W. Bush’s White House.” The concerns arise from opinions Kavanaugh wrote in cases challenging the Affordable Care Act and in a recent case over the right of an immigrant teenager in federal custody to have an abortion. The judge dissented in those cases, but did not go as far as “ideological purists” would have liked.</p>
<p>Federal Judge Downplayed Role in Detainee Cases</p>
<p>NPR, June 2007</p>
<p>NPR’s Ari Shapiro reported on what some Democratic senators saw as misleading testimony Kavanaugh provided during his 2006 confirmation hearing to become a federal appeals judge in Washington. Kavanaugh had told Sen. Richard Durbin, D.-Illinois, that during his time in the Bush White House he was not involved in conversations about the rules governing the handling of detainees captured in the War on Terror. In fact, he had been involved in 2002 discussions about whether detainees had a right to an attorney. Durbin told NPR he felt “perilously close to being lied to.” (Kavanaugh, through a court spokesman, called his testimony accurate.)</p>

<p class="byline">by: Melissa Sanchez</p>
<p>date:</p>
<p class="source">url: <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/propublica-illinois-wbez-chicago-tickets-melissa-sanchez-elliott-ramos">https://www.propublica.org/article/propublica-illinois-wbez-chicago-tickets-melissa-sanchez-elliott-ramos</a></p>
<p>Driven into Debt</p>
<p>Hi. Two of us are writing this week: Melissa Sanchez from ProPublica Illinois and Elliott Ramos from WBEZ. Why two of us? Well, a few months ago, we realized we were both digging into data on Chicago parking and traffic camera tickets. And lucky for us, we both work for news organizations that believe in collaboration, so it was easy to team up instead of racing to beat each other.</p>
<p>Last week, we published our first story together on how Chicago has issued thousands of duplicate tickets to drivers and why impoverished black communities are getting the worst of it.</p>
<p>We plan to do more. But first, we want to tell you about how we teamed up, what we’ve learned and where we want to report next. Maybe you can help us find the next story.</p>
<p>— Melissa and Elliott</p>
<p>Why we are so interested in the tickets:</p>
<p>ProPublica Illinois reporter Melissa Sanchez and WBEZ digital editor Elliott Ramos.</p>
<p>Elliott: In Chicago, people complain that ticketing, fines and fees make it harder and harder to afford to live here. The silver lining, if there is one, is that all those tickets come with a data trove that says who owes what and where they live and where they were ticketed. You can start to compare what’s happening in different neighborhoods, see how ticketing has changed over time and determine whether complaints about disparities are true.</p>
<p>Melissa: Ticket debt is devastating thousands of Chicago families — generations of families, really — right under our noses. I’ve talked to people who are in bankruptcy, and whose parents, siblings, children and grandchildren have also filed for bankruptcy — all because of debt from tickets. The city’s long had this narrative about how “scofflaws” just need to pay up. It’s a lot more complicated than that.</p>
<p>How we started working together:</p>
<p>Elliott: I have been working on ticket and towing stories for almost a year now. When I read Melissa and Sandhya’s first story, I was blown away. It was refreshing to see someone else not only look at the data the same way, but they blew the doors open and went right into how it was affecting people and sending thousands of people into debt — even into bankruptcy. I knew the data they were using and had some data they hadn’t used, and offered it up to see if there was any way it could advance their work.</p>
<p>Melissa: I didn’t know Elliott but I’d read (and heard) his previous reporting and seen his name in city request logs for similar sets of data. I was nervous he was going to scoop us on the bankruptcy story. Instead, when that story came out, Elliott reached out with a sweet email offering to share four data sets “which might be helpful for you guys if you hadn’t already FOIA’d [reporter shorthand for “filed a records request under the Freedom of Information Act”] or obtained it.” Match made in nerd heaven.</p>
<p>What collaboration looked like:</p>
<p>Melissa: We did almost everything using Google Docs — from writing the story and watching editors jump in with revisions, to compiling FOIA requests and preparing questions for the city.</p>
<p>Both journalists were digging into data on Chicago parking and traffic camera tickets — so they decided to collaborate.</p>
<p>Our offices aren’t super close so we didn’t see each other a lot in person. But sometimes we met for lunch or coffee to check in, like this day at a tea shop, which Elliott documented with a nerdy photo of our spreadsheets and paperwork.</p>
<p>Elliott: I like that we complement each others’ skills. I tend to use Pandas in Python and Melissa uses SQL for analysis. I was mapping data while she was knocking on doors. I joked that I’m like the man in the van in those movies where the tech geek is on radio and the laptop hacking doors for the secret agent.</p>
<p>The reaction from readers:</p>
<p>Melissa: Super engaged! Especially after we got to talk about our findings on Cliff Kelley’s afternoon show on WVON. One comment that really stood out came from a man from Hyde Park who works in IT. He couldn’t believe the city didn’t systematically flag and toss out duplicate tickets. “That’s a very simple technology application,” he told us. “You don’t need Mark Zuckerberg.”</p>
<p>Elliott: After WVON, I had folks calling my desk phone. I think there’s genuine frustration with tickets that goes beyond the money. There’s a perception of harassment or that the city is out to get them. With data, we can actually figure out if there’s some truth to that feeling. Whether or not it’s exaggerated, or whether or not some areas are genuinely getting hit harder with tickets.</p>
<p>What drivers are supposed to do if they feel they’ve been wrongly ticketed:</p>
<p>Melissa: There’s an appeals process, which can be done online, by mail or through in-person hearings. The city also said drivers can bypass the hearings process and call the Finance Department’s customer service line, at 312-744-7275, if they believe they’ve been issued a ticket in error.</p>
<p>If you go the hearings route, feel free to reach out and let us know how it went. We might even ask to tag along.</p>
<p>What we want to know more about:</p>
<p>Elliott: I’m interested in what happens when tickets escalate to a boot or an impound. Often the ticket debt compounds, but when a vehicle is impounded, it can set off a whole new set of circumstances with different outcomes for different people.</p>
<p>Melissa: We plan to look a bit deeper into the city sticker and related tickets, in addition to a few other kinds of citations. I’m also interested in talking with people who’ve lost city jobs because of ticket debt, and learning more about the city’s administrative hearings process and the companies it contracts to do debt collection.</p>
<p>If you have any other ideas or tips, email us at <a href="mailto:melissa.sanchez@propublica.org">melissa.sanchez@propublica.org</a> and <a href="mailto:eramos@wbez.org">eramos@wbez.org</a>. We like to work together.</p>

<p class="byline">by: Ali Winston</p>
<p class="date">2018-07-04</p>
<p class="source">url: <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/michael-miselis-rise-above-movement-white-supremacist-group-northrop-grumman">https://www.propublica.org/article/michael-miselis-rise-above-movement-white-supremacist-group-northrop-grumman</a></p>
<p>Michael Miselis, standing in the crowd with both arms raised, was front and center during the violence in Charlottesville last summer. Miselis holds a national security clearance for his work with defense contractor Northrop Grumman. (Edu Bayer, special to ProPublica)</p>
<p>Documenting Hate</p>
<p>There likely isn’t such a thing as a “typical” violent white extremist in America in 2018. Still, Michael Miselis — a University of California, Los Angeles doctoral student with a U.S. government security clearance to work on sensitive research for a prominent defense contractor — makes for a pretty unusual case.</p>
<p>For months, ProPublica and Frontline have been working to identify the white supremacists at the center of violent demonstrations across the country, including the infamous Unite the Right rally last August in Charlottesville, Virginia. The Rise Above Movement, a Southern California group that expresses contempt for Muslims, Jews, and immigrants, became a focus of that effort. ProPublica and Frontline were able to quickly identify a number of the group’s leaders, and find evidence that put them in the middle of violence in Charlottesville and Berkeley, California, among other places.</p>
<p>This story is part of an ongoing collaboration between ProPublica and Frontline that includes documentaries scheduled to begin on PBS in August 2018.</p>
<p>But one seeming member of RAM was harder to nail down. In video shot in Charlottesville, a bearded, husky man is seen in a red Make America Great Again hat with his hands wrapped in tape that came in handy for the brawling that occurred that day. During one encounter, the unidentified man in the red hat pushed an African-American protester to the ground and began pounding on him, video of the episode shows; moments later, a known RAM member choked and bloodied a pair of female counterprotesters. The possible RAM member also had turned up in video shot during hours of combat at a Trump rally in Berkeley, as well. Wearing protective goggles to ward off pepper spray, the man fought alongside RAM members, wrestling one protester to the ground and punching others.</p>
<p>Ultimately, ProPublica and Frontline determined the man in the violent footage was Miselis, a 29-year-old pursuing a Ph.D. in UCLA’s aerospace engineering program. Miselis was identified using video footage and social media posts, and reporters confirmed his identity in an encounter with him outside his home. In interviews, a number of California law enforcement officials said Miselis was a member of RAM.</p>
<p>In addition to his scholarly pursuits, Miselis works as a systems engineer for Northrop Grumman, the giant defense contractor with a plant in Redondo Beach, California.</p>
<p>When approached by ProPublica and Frontline in front of his home in Lawndale, a small city south of Los Angeles, Miselis said he “didn’t know anything” about what happened in Charlottesville.</p>
<p>“I think you got the wrong guy,” he said before driving off in his car.</p>
<p>Miselis did not respond to questions about his involvement with RAM. He did not answer additional questions sent by email.</p>
<p>Several current and former employees at Northrop Grumman told ProPublica and Frontline that Miselis has received a security clearance to work in a computer modeling and simulation group within Northrop’s aerospace division. Such security clearances are typically issued in a two-step process. The federal Office of Personnel Management conducts an investigation into the individual. The agency’s findings are then forwarded to a special unit within the Department of Defense, which makes the final determination on whether the person should receive a clearance, a status that often allows the person access to classified or otherwise sensitive information concerning national security.</p>
<p>Public affairs officers at the Defense Department declined to comment about Miselis and his security clearance. The federal personnel management office referred questions regarding Miselis to Northrop Grumman.</p>
<p>Northrop Grumman did not respond to several requests for comment. However, interviews with current and former Northrop employees, as well as an internal email, make clear the company knows of Miselis’ actions in Charlottesville and involvement with RAM. Miselis informed his superiors about his contact with reporters from ProPublica and Frontline, as is required by any individual who holds a higher-level security clearance, the people said.</p>
<p>With hands taped like a boxer, Michael Miselis pushes an unidentified African-American man to the ground in Charlottesville last August.</p>
<p>So far, it seems, the company has taken no action against Miselis, who remains employed.</p>
<p>Keegan Hankes, an analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center who follows RAM closely, said he was surprised that nothing has been done about Miselis’ employment and security clearance.</p>
<p>“It’s ridiculous,” Hankes said.</p>
<p>“They’re openly motivated by racism,” he added of RAM.</p>
<p>As ProPublica has previously reported, RAM first surfaced publicly last spring and has quickly established itself as one of the violent groups in the resurgent white supremacist scene; members, who regularly train in boxing and martial arts, have been documented engaging in a string of melees. Founded in early 2017 by Robert Rundo, a Queens, New York, native who served an 18-month prison sentence for stabbing a rival gang member six times during a 2009 street fight, the group’s core membership is small — 15 to 20 young men — but capable of real menace, ProPublica’s reporting has shown.</p>
<p>Rundo has recruited followers from the Orange County and San Diego chapters of the Hammerskin Nation, the country’s largest Nazi skinhead gang, and one the authorities say has been behind at least nine murders. One of the Hammerskins who joined up with RAM, Matthew Branstetter, went to prison in California in 2011 on hate crime charges for robbing and assaulting a Jewish man in an Orange County park. The attack left the victim with “a concussion, broken jaw, eye socket fracture, broken nose, cracked ribs, severe facial bruising, and cuts and bruises to his body and face,” according to a news release issued by county prosecutors at the time. Other RAM members have spent time in prison and Los Angeles County Jail on charges for robbery, firearms possession and other offenses.</p>

<p>The FBI has taken notice. Several law enforcement officials familiar with the bureau’s work said agents have opened a formal investigation into RAM. In a statement, the FBI said, “While the FBI neither confirms nor denies the existence of an investigation, our agents investigate activity which may constitute a federal crime or pose a threat to national security. Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on criminal activity. The FBI cannot initiate an investigation based solely on an individual’s race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, or the exercise of their First Amendment rights, and we remain committed to protecting those rights for all Americans.”</p>
<p>Since last August, local prosecutors have brought charges against a handful of participants in the Charlottesville rally, successfully convicting several men so far, including activists on both sides of the clashes. Now federal authorities are targeting neo-Nazi James Alex Fields, the man accused of killing counterprotester Heather Heyer and injuring more than two dozen others. Federal prosecutors recently filed 30 charges against Fields, including 28 hate crime charges.</p>
<p>A native of Stockton, California, Miselis earned a bachelor’s of science degree in mechanical engineering from UCLA in 2011. UCLA’s website today lists Miselis as a Ph.D. candidate in the engineering department’s hypersonics and computational aero-dynamics group. After Frontline and ProPublica began making inquiries about Miselis, the school issued a brief statement saying only that he is technically on leave from the doctoral program.</p>
<p>Racist, Violent, Unpunished: A White Hate Group’s Campaign of Menace</p>
<p>Miselis was clearly prepared for the unrest in Berkeley in the spring of 2017. At the Trump rally he wore protective goggles to ward off pepper spray or tear gas, taped his hands up like a boxer, and wore a gray active-wear uniform, as did several other RAM members that day. In video footage reviewed by ProPublica and Frontline, Miselis can be seen fighting alongside other RAM members.</p>
<p>The event turned into a multi-hour street battle pitting Trump supporters, including fascists and extreme-right activists, against counterprotesters, some of them militant anti-fascists. Police made 20 arrests, confiscating knives, pepper spray, a stun gun, an axe-handle, and many wooden dowel rods, which were used as clubs by participants. At least seven people were transported to the hospital for their injuries. Rundo, RAM’s founder, was arrested and detained for assault on a police officer, but Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O’Malley declined to file charges. “We determined we didn’t have enough evidence to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt,” said Teresa Drenick, an Alameda County deputy district attorney.</p>
<p>After the Berkeley rally, Miselis traveled across the country to take part in the massive white supremacist convergence in Charlottesville, where his activities were photographed and recorded on video, both by professional journalists and other people equipped with smart phones. At the rally on Aug. 12, pictures taken by photojournalist Jason Andrew show Miselis walking alongside two other RAM members previously identified by ProPublica, Tom Gillen and Ben Daley.</p>
<p>At roughly 10 a.m., Miselis and the other RAM members confronted counterprotesters a few steps away from Emancipation Park, where white supremacists had gathered beneath a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.</p>
<p>Miselis prepares to hurl what appears to be a soda can at counterprotesters during the weekend of mayhem around the Unite the Right rally.</p>
<p>Daley attacked two female counterprotesters, kicking and punching them, a scene captured in video obtained by ProPublica and Frontline. He wrapped both hands around the throat of one woman, throttling her until she fell to the ground, blood seeping from a gash on her temple. The other woman emerged from the incident with a laceration across her forehead. On video, she screams as blood drips across her face.</p>
<p>Miselis jumped into the fracas. In addition to Frontline and ProPublica, National Geographic produced video documenting the brawl.</p>

<p>Despite requests from a senator and the European Union, the Trump administration is refusing to make public an important report by a federal privacy watchdog about how the U.S. government handles personal information swept up by its surveillance.</p>
<p>The public has a right to know what the government does with the vast troves of private data that American intelligence agencies collect in the course of their spying. On Thursday, we filed a Freedom of Information Act request demanding the release of the report, significant portions of which are unclassified.</p>
<p>The report is from the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which was created by Congress to be an independent, bipartisan agency. Its mission is to help ensure that national security laws and programs don’t infringe on individual rights. As part of that mission, the board has issued several significant oversight reports addressing government surveillance. While we have not always agreed with the conclusions of these reports, they have played a vital role in the democratic process by educating the public about the powerful spying tools at the government’s disposal. In the wake of Edward Snowden’s revelations about the National Security Agency’s illegal mass surveillance programs, the board’s work informed the public debate by prompting the declassification of additional details about these secret programs.</p>
<p>Recognizing the board’s importance as a mechanism for transparency, Congress required that it make its reports public to the greatest extent possible. But now the Trump administration is wrongly trying to keep its findings secret.</p>
<p>The report we’re seeking concerns the implementation of President Obama’s 2014 policy directive on government spying and the handling of personal information, which can include emails, chats, text messages, and more. The directive recognized that “all persons have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information.” While Obama’s policy changes left much to be desired, they did include improvements, including some very modest protections for the handling of personal information of non-American citizens abroad. The directive also encouraged the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to provide the president with a report assessing how the new policies were carried out.</p>
<p>In December 2016, the board delivered its report to the White House and congressional intelligence committees. Two months later, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wrote a letter to Office of the Director of National Intelligence, urging it to make public the unclassified portions of the report and to declassify the rest of it as soon as possible. European Union officials and representatives have also called for the report’s release.</p>
<p>In response, the Trump administration has refused to release any of the report, even with redactions, citing executive privilege. By shrouding the report in secrecy, the administration is depriving the public of the ability to understand how the government is applying Obama’s efforts to impose even minimal privacy safeguards on highly controversial NSA spying.</p>
<p>The European Union has said that the disclosure of the report is important for its annual assessment of the central U.S.-EU data-sharing agreement, known as Privacy Shield. That agreement allows American tech firms to operate in Europe and easily transfer data to the United States.</p>
<p>Just last week, the European Parliament called for the suspension of the Privacy Shield agreement because the United States is not complying with EU law. Suspending the agreement would be devastating for Silicon Valley. One of parliament’s many concerns was Trump’s claim of “presidential privilege” over the board’s report, which likely addresses the implementation of privacy protections for Europeans.</p>
<p>In addition to keeping the report secret, the Trump administration appears to be undermining the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board’s proper functioning. Since February 2017, four of the board’s five positions have been vacant, preventing it from doing much of its work to investigate government overreach. Three new members have been nominated but are still awaiting Senate confirmation after many months. Even if all three were confirmed, that would leave the board imbalanced, with three Republicans and only one Democrat. In this scenario, the board’s rules require that the next member not be a Republican, but Trump has made no nomination.</p>
<p>Given the vacancies — and the fact that the current nominee for chair of the board is on the record supporting unconstitutional surveillance programs — there are now serious questions regarding whether the board will act as an independent check on surveillance abuses by the executive branch in the future.</p>
<p>Despite questions about the future of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, its reports have shed much-needed light on the government’s surveillance practices. By hiding the report that we’re demanding today, the Trump administration is not only undermining the board’s purpose — it’s also undermining democratic accountability.</p>

<p>web17-BostonPolice2-1160x768.jpg</p>
<p>Over the past week, a Facebook video went viral, showing an El Paso police officer drawing his gun on a group of Latino kids outside a community center and handcuffing the person taking the video. The video has drawn outrage — and rightly so — as an illustration of the urgent need for robust police policies and training emphasizing de-escalation and how to interact with youth.</p>
<p>The video cuts in when the officer has one of the kids detained on the ground. The other kids — upset about what’s going on — yell at the officer. In response, he draws his gun, points it at the group, and yells, “Back up, motherfuckers!” Another officer runs up, and they drag the detained kid to the roadside. While the second officer cuffs him, the first officer returns to the group with his nightstick out, yelling at the kids to “get back.”</p>
<p>Seeing that the other kids are getting upset, the kid with the camera yells over, “It’s all good, wait, we’re going to put a report on these two fools. It’s all good.” The officer then approaches him and places him in handcuffs. After the kid’s mom takes the camera, the officer directs her to come over to him. When she runs away, he threatens, “I know where you live!”</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, the officer goes back to the kids and asks them what they’re going to do. He challenges them: “Do something! Do something!” He moves chest-to-chest with one of them, staring aggressively down — and ends up bringing that kid to the police car too, detaining him.</p>
<p>The video captures a police officer acting contrary to his sworn oath to protect and serve. Instead of de-escalating the situation using techniques designed to calm everyone down and avoid violence, the officer raised the stakes. And when another kid tried to de-escalate the situation by telling the kids he had everything on video — which the First Amendment gives him the right to do — the officer arrested him and put him in the back of the patrol car.</p>
<p>De-escalation is one of the most important strategies for policing. The Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), an independent research organization, calls it the “preferred, tactically sound” approach for resolving incidents and recommends that it should be a “core theme” of any agency’s training program. Without de-escalating situations, officers create opportunities for unnecessary use of force with devastating consequences for the communities they are supposed to serve.</p>
<p>Although many police departments across the country have some form of de-escalation referenced in policies and training, police departments generally place much more emphasis in training on using force instead. A 2015 PERF study of 280 departments across the U.S. found that for every hour recruits received on de-escalation training, they received over seven hours of firearms training. De-escalation training needs to be emphasized for all officers serving their communities. Otherwise, we wind up with situations like the one in El Paso.</p>
<p>For similar reasons, officers also need clear policies and training on interacting with youth. Even though juveniles are only involved with 3.5 percent of all police interactions, they make up 30.1 percent of all interactions where police use force (the vast majority of which are initiated by officers).</p>
<p>Strategies for Youth, which specializes in research and evidence-based training for law enforcement, has found that “a little bit of knowledge about how teens think can go a long way toward avoiding the escalation of minor incidents.” It’s “how officers read the youth and the incident” that affects how the incidents go down. Unfortunately, few officers receive this type of training in any meaningful way. In Texas, the most recent survey of hours spent on juvenile justice training for new recruits showed an average of just 2 percent of total training time.</p>
<p>According to Strategies for Youth, “The critical factor in the youth’s response and perception of the legitimacy of police authority is how an officer approaches a youth.” The El Paso kids in the video were insulting the officer — but responding aggressively and with violent displays of force was counterproductive, not to mention counter to the professional standards we should hold police officers to.</p>
<p>Interactions like these reinforce the serious disadvantage youth of color already experience and recognize in their interactions with police, which have lasting and radical effects in our communities. And arrests like the ones in this video for “youthful disobedience rather than significant crimes” funnel kids of color into the criminal justice system, triggering a chain of events that can disrupt the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>The El Paso Police Department as well as police departments across the country must ensure that their policies and their police training allow officers to automatically de-escalate situations and respond to youth effectively. The kids in this video are the canaries in the coal mine.</p>

<p>web17-PrisonDoor-1160x768.jpg</p>
<p>Beginning in 2010, a Connecticut man, Almighty Supreme Born Allah, spent over six months in solitary confinement. He was alone for 23 hours a day, allowed to shower just three times a week in underwear and leg shackles, and permitted only one 30-minute visit each week with a family member, whom he was not allowed to embrace, let alone touch. Studies have shown that this kind of isolation can result in clinical outcomes similar to those of physical torture, which is why numerous international human rights bodies have condemned the prolonged use of solitary confinement.</p>
<p>The twist on this twisted set of punishments?</p>
<p>Allah had not been convicted of a crime when he was put in solitary confinement. He sued, and four federal judges agreed with Allah that this treatment during pretrial detention violated his constitutional rights. And yet, he lost his case because of a rule called qualified immunity that the U.S. Supreme Court created in the 1980s. As William Baude, a constitutional law professor from the University of Chicago, explains, “[t]he doctrine of qualified immunity prevents government agents from being held personally liable for constitutional violations unless the violation was of ‘clearly established’ law.”</p>
<p>To understand how this works you have to start with a federal law called section 1983, which holds state and local government officials liable for money damages in federal court if they have violated constitutional rights. This law has been on the books since 1871, and it was originally enacted to stop law enforcement from ignoring the lynching of newly freed Black citizens.</p>
<p>But while section 1983 was intended to increase accountability for government officials who break the law, the Supreme Court created a giant loophole that undermines that goal, making it virtually impossible for government officials to be held personally liable for wrongdoing. That loophole is qualified immunity, which either the Supreme Court or Congress could fix to ensure constitutional misconduct does not go unpunished.</p>
<p>Since the creation of qualified immunity, the rule has snowballed out of control. As the judges on Allah’s case explained, the rule now allows “all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law” to defeat lawsuits brought by the victims of government overreach. The result, as Justice Sotomayor recently argued in a dissent, is that “palpably unreasonable conduct will go unpunished.”</p>
<p>That’s exactly what happened in Allah’s case.</p>
<p>In 1979, the Supreme Court held in Bell v. Wolfish that under the Constitution’s Due Process Clause, pretrial detainees cannot be punished. Restrictions on a pretrial detainee’s liberty, the court concluded, have to be “reasonably related to a legitimate nonpunitive governmental objective.” If the restriction is “arbitrary or purposeless,” however, “a court may permissibly infer that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment that may not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees.”</p>
<p>Under Bell, in other words, the government can hold people in jail to make sure they show up to their trial and can also limit exercise time in jail for the sake of keeping order. But the government cannot subject pretrial detainees to harsh conditions just to punish them. And this matters because a staggering 465,000 people are in pretrial detention on any given day in America.</p>
<p>Explaining this rule in Bell, the Supreme Court said:</p>
<p>“[L]oading a detainee with chains and shackles and throwing him in a dungeon may ensure his presence at trial and preserve the security of the institution. But it would be difficult to conceive of a situation where conditions so harsh, employed to achieve objectives that could be accomplished in so many alternative and less harsh methods, would not support a conclusion that the purpose for which they were imposed was to punish.”</p>
<p>Again, this is what the Supreme Court said in 1979, almost 40 years ago.</p>
<p>Yet in 2010, when Allah was in jail pretrial, he was kept in solitary confinement. He sued the jail officials he claimed were responsible for violating his rights and four federal judges agreed with him that this treatment was unconstitutional — first, the trial-level judge, and then three judges assigned to the case on appeal. According to one of the judges who ruled on Allah’s case, the jail officials failed to provide any justification why this was necessary even though “the extremity of the conditions imposed upon Allah come perilously close to the Supreme Court’s description of ‘loading a detainee with chains and shackles and throwing him in a dungeon.’”</p>
<p>When four federal judges agree that your rights were violated, that should mean there’s some kind of remedy, right? Wrong.</p>
<p>Despite the similarity between what the Supreme Court said was unconstitutional in 1979 and the conditions of Allah’s pretrial confinement, two of the three judges who heard Allah’s case on appeal concluded that qualified immunity shields the jail officials from liability — meaning Allah has no recourse for the infringement on his rights.</p>
<p>And he’s not the only one.</p>
<p>The doctrine of qualified immunity undermines our constitutional rights, including the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, and the right to be free from racial discrimination. Qualified immunity is one of the many barriers standing in the way of justice and accountability when the police use excessive force disproportionately against people of color.</p>
<p>Now Allah is asking the Supreme Court to hear his case and to reconsider qualified immunity. The ACLU has joined forces with 14 organizations to file a friend-of-the-court brief in support of Allah’s ongoing fight for justice. This coalition includes organizations representing a broad range of ideological perspectives — from criminal justice reform groups to law enforcement. The ideological diversity of our coalition is a clear indication of a larger truth: People across the political spectrum and from many backgrounds believe in a robust remedy when the government violates an individual’s constitutional rights.</p>
<p>This diverse group has come together to urge the Supreme Court to abandon or reform qualified immunity so that victims of official misconduct can hold the government accountable. This simple goal reflects a foundational value: Our government is supposed to be based on the rule of law, not the rule of men. But as Chief Justice Marshall admonished in 1803, our government “will certainly cease to deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right.”</p>

<p>Few times in recent memory have demanded a more careful examination of our nation’s history than now — the year we celebrate the 150th anniversary of the 14th Amendment’s passage. At a time when the Trump administration is throwing asylum seekers in jail without due process and undermining efforts to desegregate schools, it is critical to remember that the “pervading purpose” of the 14th Amendment was to eliminate the oppression of historically subjugated minorities and to provide equality of opportunity.</p>
<p>The amendment’s ratification on July 9, 1868, shortly after African-Americans were emancipated from slavery, represented a turning point in the country’s history. Its passage was an effort to provide substance to the Declaration of Independence’s promises of freedom and equality, which from the beginning had not applied to significant parts of the population, including Black people and women. And though those promises were continually reneged upon, the 14th Amendment remained a source of aspiration and hope.</p>
<p>Although the 14th Amendment is frequently invoked now, particularly by conservative judges and commentators, to attack affirmative action and efforts to desegregate schools under the guise of “colorblindness,” the Fourteenth Amendment was never a colorblind document. The amendment was enacted specifically for purposes of assisting newly freed Black people. Although the 13th Amendment ended slavery, it left uncertain the status of those who had been kept in bondage. The infamous Dred Scott case had held that Blacks had no rights that whites were bound to respect and denied them citizenship. The 14th Amendment was necessary to make clear that Black people, as well as anyone born in the country or naturalized, were American citizens.</p>
<p>The Trump administration has made loud and clear its disdain for any programs that consider race in college admissions, which betrays the 14th Amendment’s unambiguous history as a statute offering Black people protection in areas replete with discrimination. The 14th Amendment was enacted with the intent to support a series of race-conscious programs that were created at the time to aid Blacks newly emancipated by the 13th Amendment. A series of programs such as the Freedman’s Bureau, special assistance for Black Civil War veterans, and special relief to Blacks in the District of Columbia were enacted in the period following the Civil War in the face of opposition arguing that the programs would make “a distinction on account of color between the two races.” Vetoes of the Freedman’s Bureau Act were overridden twice by Congress and the 14th Amendment was enacted in the midst of the discussions regarding these acts.</p>
<p>The road to equality by way of the 14th Amendment was not always an easy one. Some of the most ignoble policies and practices, such as forced racial segregation in public schools and public spaces and the incarceration of Japanese-Americans and people of Japanese ancestry during World War II, were found to be consistent with the Constitution. And, as time has passed, its initial emphasis on addressing the rights of freed Black people has shifted substantially.</p>
<p>Despite the setbacks, the 14th Amendment has been vital in protecting the equal protection and due process rights of a greater number of people. Whether assuring counsel and a bias-free jury, working in conjunction with the First Amendment to assure freedom of worship, guaranteeing the rights of same-sex couples to marry, protecting the right to vote, supporting the right of transgender students to receive access to education, prohibiting racial segregation in schools, ending restrictions against mixed-race marriages, supporting the right of women to have access to birth control and abortion, or protecting the rights of immigrants, the 14th Amendment has been a powerful tool in the protection of the rights and liberties of all Americans.</p>
<p>But the amendments’ 150th anniversary is not solely an occasion to celebrate. Rights won, even after long protracted struggles, can be lost. In the current political climate — one in which efforts are being made to limit the enforcement actions of agencies and departments which once sought to strenuously enforce the 14th Amendment and one in which judges are selected for their antipathy to rights secured on behalf of people of color and other vulnerable populations — the 14th Amendment faces the realistic possibility of being stripped of its authority and its ability to stand as a bulwark against oppression.</p>
<p>We cannot take the 14th Amendment for granted. Instead, it’s imperative that we use every means at our disposal to assure that the amendment continues to serve as a path to freedom and full equality for those who need it most.</p>

<p>WEB18-PoliceSaluting-1160x768.jpg</p>
<p>When reporter Joshua Vaughn of The Appeal told me that some Pennsylvania police have charged people with “ethnic intimidation” — the state’s version of a hate crime — for saying offensive things to the officers who arrest them, I thought, “Not again!”</p>
<p>No, really. This is another version of “contempt of cop,” the police practice of punishing people who defy them with criminal charges. So now, amidst a rising tide of actual hate crimes, we have police officers using hate crime laws to punish people who get angry when they are being arrested.</p>
<p>In June, I reviewed the affidavits of probable cause that four officers used to justify hate crimes charges against four suspects in 2016. Two people were being arrested for minor crimes. The third was arrested for getting upset when the police would not take her complaint, and the fourth was being picked up for a psychiatric check.</p>
<p>Yet, all of them ended up charged with hate crimes.</p>
<p>Sannetta Amoroso went to her local police station in January 2016 to report a stolen TV but became agitated when the police asked her to write it down, so the officers decided to arrest her for disorderly conduct. She resisted and was knocked to the ground and overpowered. While handcuffed in her cell, she yelled, “Death to all you white bitches. I’m going to kill all you white bitches. I hope ISIS kills all you white bitches.” She received six charges, including a felony assault charge for hitting an officer in the arm and felony ethnic intimidation.</p>
<p>In June 2016, State Trooper Robert Wareham came upon Steven Oller’s car parked on the side of the road, with Oller outside. Wareham described Oller as shaking, with dilated pupils and bloodshot eyes. Oller was forcibly subdued, cuffed, placed in a patrol car, and driven to a hospital for blood testing.</p>
<p>During the incident, Oller called a trooper with a Latino last name a “wetback,” stated that he did not “speak kielbasa,” and spoke of another trooper having anal and oral sex with men. Oller was charged with a slew of offenses, including harassment and ethnic intimidation.</p>
<p>In August 2016, the police handcuffed Seneca Payne at home and drove him to a hospital for a “welfare check” when a neighbor reported that Payne had been drunk and talked of hurting himself. On the way, Payne said to one trooper, “Are you a citizen?”, “nigger,” “Go back to your country Ghandi motherfucker,” and “gook mother fucker.” Payne was charged with misdemeanor resisting arrest, fighting, and ethnic intimidation.</p>
<p>In September 2016, Robbie Sanderson was arrested when employees at a CVS claimed he was shoplifting. After he had been cuffed and placed in a police car, he called the arresting officer a “mother fucker,” a “fucking militant,” a “fucking skinhead,” and “Gestapo.” At the station, Sanderson called the chief of police a “fat motherfucker” and made violent threats while in his cell. The arresting officer charged Sanderson with terroristic threats and ethnic intimidation — but never said why he thought the “threats” were motivated by bias.</p>
<p>These people said awful things to the police, but they all were handcuffed and far from threatening. We expect our police to be thick-skinned because their job is, by definition, dealing with people at their worst. That’s not an original thought — the courts have said so for years.</p>
<p>In 1974, in Lewis v. New Orleans, the Supreme Court struck down a city ordinance that made it a crime “for any person wantonly to curse or revile or to use obscene or opprobrious language toward or with reference to” a city officer. The court said, “A properly trained police officer may reasonably be expected to exercise a higher degree of restraint” than the average citizen when insulted. Thirteen years later, the court, citing Lewis, struck down a Houston ordinance that made it a crime to “oppose . . . or interrupt any policeman” in the performance of his duties.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, as in many other states, an ethnic intimidation charge is an “up charge,” meaning the suspect faces harsher discipline under the law. Robbie Sanderson, for example, was charged with “terroristic threats,” a first-degree misdemeanor. The additional ethnic intimidation charge, however, is a third-degree felony that carries a maximum of sentence of seven years’ incarceration. That was Sanderson’s only felony that day.</p>
<p>Oller’s and Payne’s misdemeanor ethnic intimidation charges could get them each a year in jail. Amoroso was given a second-degree felony for hitting one of the officers who tackled her. But the charge for what she said is a first-degree felony, with a potential sentence of 20 years’ incarceration.</p>
<p>Hate crime laws are supposed to deter and punish crimes that target people for who they are and make the world safer for communities that suffer from discrimination.</p>
<p>Sanderson, Oller, Amoroso, and Payne resisted arrest, both physically and verbally, because they didn’t want to be arrested — not because of the color of the officers’ skin. Charging them with ethnic intimidation and threatening them with years of prison for their words does not make the world safer for anyone.</p>
<p>Hate crime charges should be reserved for the serious crimes they were intended to address, not used by police seeking to punish people for disrespect. As Supreme Court Justice William Brennan said: “The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.”</p>

<p>The continuing cruelty on display at our southern border has unleashed a righteous, primal scream of revulsion from Americans across the ideological spectrum. The outrage, plus a successful ACLU legal effort in San Diego, seems to have helped turn the tide toward family reunification. However, the common refrain seems to be, “This is not who we are,” as if ripping families apart to punish or deter crime is so novel and grotesque that it’s unrecognizable as American.</p>
<p>The truth is that the criminal justice system we are imposing on immigrants is a reflection of the one we impose on our own — and both need fixing. At the border, we are taking children from desperate parents based on misdemeanor border crossing — or based on no illegality at all, if the family has properly presented itself for asylum.</p>
<p>But every day inside the United States, we do a version of this to tens of thousands of our own citizens. Judges and prosecutors impose cash bail that keeps parents locked up and apart from their families prior to trial, and children’s services agencies often remove kids from their parents based on unsubstantiated criminal allegations as proof of parental unfitness.</p>
<p>Every day, roughly 450,000 people are held in jail pretrial — meaning they are presumed innocent of any crime — and a significant portion of those are behind bars because they cannot afford bail. Worse yet, the arrest that resulted in pretrial detention is routinely used to justify a criminal temporary order of protection, or triggers the removal of children by a family court, even before the state proves the crime.</p>

<p>web17-PrisonHallway-1160x768.jpg</p>
<p>After spending years as the prison capital of the world, a new report indicates that Louisiana has finally shed this shameful title thanks to the historic package of criminal justice reforms passed last year. According to the Prison Policy Initiative, Louisiana’s incarceration rate is now the second highest in the nation, below that of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>This is a major milestone and a testament to the diverse grassroots coalition that came together to pass proven, evidence-based reforms that are reducing our prison population, saving taxpayers millions, and improving public safety. These reforms reined in mandatory minimum sentences, expanded parole eligibility, and stopped people from getting thrown in jail for court fees they couldn’t afford to pay. And they are already paying big dividends for our state and its citizens.</p>
<p>In the year since these laws were passed, our total prison population has dropped by 7.6 percent, and the number of people imprisoned for nonviolent crimes has decreased by 20 percent. Equally promising is that prison admissions for drug possession have dropped by nearly half. And despite the constant fear-mongering of opponents, there are signs that Louisiana’s overall crime rate is down as well.</p>
<p>But this fight isn’t over yet. Far too many people are still languishing behind bars awaiting trial and some of our most extreme sentencing laws have yet to be reformed. Louisiana’s incarceration rate is still way above the national average, which means that taxpayers are still footing the bill for a bloated prison system that has devastated communities of color and failed to make us safer.</p>
<p>That’s why what happened during this past legislative session was so important. After scoring a huge win with the passage of the criminal justice reform package, some people assumed we’d pack up and go home.</p>
<p>They were wrong. We weren’t going anywhere.</p>
<p>The grassroots coalition that had helped pass the most sweeping criminal justice reforms in Louisiana’s history was united and determined to not only protect the progress that we’d made but build on it. In addition to fending off bills that would have dismantled these vital reforms, we went on offense — passing legislation to restore the voting rights of thousands of formerly incarcerated people and giving voters the chance to abolish Louisiana’s abhorrent non-unanimous jury rule.</p>
<p>Throughout, the leaders of this effort were the courageous Louisianans who had been incarcerated themselves. Thanks to their tireless advocacy, Louisiana has finally begun to confront and reckon with its ugly legacy of institutionalized oppression and injustice while building a criminal justice system that’s worthy of the name.</p>
<p>Importantly, this milestone is just the first of many that we must achieve. The fact that Louisiana has dropped to second in incarceration rates shows that we’re on the right track, but we shouldn’t be satisfied with the second worst, so we can’t let up now.</p>
<p>A number of reforms recommended by the Justice Reinvestment Task Force still haven’t become law, such as removing nonviolent offenders from the state’s habitual offender law and extending parole eligibility to those longest serving individuals who have paid their debts to society. An untold number of Louisianans have been locked behind bars awaiting trial for weeks, months and even years — separated from their families and communities.</p>
<p>And this November 6, Louisiana voters will finally have the chance to abolish the state’s split-jury rule and end the insane practice of convicting people of a felony without the unanimous consent of a jury. Early voting begins October 23, and it’s vital that everyone who cares about a fair criminal justice system comes out to vote “yes” to abolish this arcane and racist practice.</p>
<p>In short, we need to keep working, marching, rallying, advocating and, most importantly, showing up at the polls in support of policies and candidates that will reduce our prison population and combat the racial disparities in our criminal justice system.</p>

<h2><a class="Complying_While_Black_Taser_Edition_12842"></a>Complying While Black (Taser Edition)</h2>

<p>When two patrons at a Starbucks cafe in Philadelphia were arrested while waiting for a colleague earlier this year, people in Pennsylvania and around the country saw on video what Black people have known for a long time — the mere act of going about our daily lives can lead to harassment, arrest, or worse.</p>
<p>The stakes are ratcheted upward dramatically when we cross paths with law enforcement officers. Even when we comply with an officer’s every request, we can be at risk of violence.</p>
<p>That’s what happened to Sean Williams, a 27-year-old Black man in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on June 28. While trying to comply with police officers’ conflicting commands, Williams was shot in the back with an electronic control device, popularly known as a Taser, after the brand that manufactures the weapon. A video recording of the incident has gone viral across the country.</p>
<p>Williams was a suspect in a dispute with three other people. While a statement from the Lancaster City Bureau of Police claims that the video does not show the full context of the incident and that Williams earlier failed to comply with their commands, the video clearly shows that the situation had deescalated to the point that Williams was seated and prepared to do what the police told him to do. Officer Philip Bernot stunned him with the Taser anyway, sending an electric shock through his body.</p>
<p>When Tasers first became available, they were marketed as an alternative to police using deadly force when they are or someone else is in danger of harm — even though a Reuters’ investigation revealed over 1,000 people have died after being shot by Tasers. As this incident and many others have shown, police are not reserving the use of these stun guns only to end potentially harmful situations. Instead, they are using the weapon as a go-to device for control, even when no one is in any danger. Whatever brought Sean Williams to the attention of the Lancaster police, he was clearly not a risk to harm anyone when he was shot with the Taser.</p>
<p>In response to the incident, Lancaster Mayor Danene Sorace pledged a full investigation by the city police and the district attorney. She also said that the incident reinforces her determination to acquire body-worn cameras for the police bureau. While an investigation is warranted and body-worn cameras may sometimes provide valuable information when complemented with policies that demand transparency and accountability, the mayor’s response does not go nearly far enough.</p>
<p>The ACLU of Pennsylvania agrees with our allies at Lancaster Stands Up, a local grassroots community group, in its three demands that the officers involved are suspended immediately, the police and the city participate in a community meeting to address residents’ concerns about excessive force by city officers, and the city create a citizen-police review board. Anything short of this will send the exact wrong message. Police officers in Lancaster need to know that they will be held accountable when they brutalize the city’s residents.</p>
<p>This kind of treatment by law enforcement officers is nothing new for Black and brown people. Yet, people of privilege who are not subject to this kind of harassment and violence tend to believe us only when it’s captured on video. Until that changes, the best tool for police accountability is the smartphone in your pocket.</p>

<p>web18_MNpride_1160x768.jpg</p>
<p>On June 30, it was announced that an anti-trans measure in Montana failed to collect enough signatures to appear on the ballot in November. This is the second time in recent months that those who oppose transgender equality have failed in their efforts to use the ballot to move their agenda forward in a state many think of as conservative.</p>
<p>The anti-trans initiative, I-183, was thought up by the Montana Family Foundation. It would have forced people to use the public accommodations, such as restrooms and locker rooms, that align with the gender listed on their original birth certificate. This law would have made public spaces, like schools, work places, and parks unsafe for transgender and non-binary Montanans. It also would have jeopardized all Montanans’ privacy — anyone entering a public space might have been forced to show paperwork proving their gender to anyone who asked.</p>
<p>The ACLU of Montana and other Montana organizations joined forces as part of the Free and Fair Montana coalition to oppose I-183. As a part of the effort, the ACLU challenged the language of the original petition in court. We were successful, causing the signature collection campaign to start over. Then we filed suit on behalf of transgender and non-binary residents of Montana saying that I-183 was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>But the success in Montana, as in Washington State and Anchorage, was ultimately made possible by the leadership of members of the transgender community, who stood up to fight against bad public policy. Through the Trans Visible Montana campaign, for example, transgender and non-binary Montanans were introduced to their neighbors and had the opportunity to explain the harmful impact a law like I-183 would have on the state.</p>
<p>The lessons from Washington State, Anchorage and Montana are clear. If we want to beat back anti-trans initiatives and legislation, the efforts have to be led by transgender people who can share their stories with voters.</p>
<p>And voters are clearly ready and willing to listen.</p>
<p>Our success in Montana is not the end of the story. In November, voters in Massachusetts will be asked to repeal a two-year-old state law that protects transgender people from non-discrimination in public accommodations, including bathrooms and locker rooms. The ACLU and the Freedom for All Massachusetts coalition are fighting for a “Yes” vote in Massachusetts to protect the nondiscrimination law. This coalition understands that our response must be to tackle myths head on and empower trans leaders and voices.</p>
<p>I’m proud of my home state for joining the growing list of states around the country that have rejected these kinds of attacks on transgender people. I believe that come November, Massachusetts voters will add their state to that list, too.</p>

<p>On July 2, the ACLU won a significant victory in our challenge to the Trump administration’s arbitrary and illegal incarceration of nearly 1,000 asylum seekers who came to the U.S. fleeing persecution, torture, or death in their countries of origin. A federal judge has found that the government’s practice of locking up asylum seekers while they await rulings in their cases violates the Department of Homeland Security’s own official policy, which instructs that asylum seekers be released on humanitarian parole if they meet a series of strict requirements.</p>
<p>All of our plaintiffs came to the U.S. seeking refuge. They presented themselves to immigration officers, passed screenings, and were found to have credible asylum claims. Then the government locked them up in immigration jails across the country. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subsequently denied their applications for “humanitarian parole,” or release from detention, despite each asylum seeker presenting evidence that they are not flight risks or dangers to the community.</p>
<p>Federal Judge James E. Boasberg found that by categorically denying our plaintiffs’ requests for release, ICE had failed to follow basic principles of government accountability:</p>
<p>This Opinion does no more than hold the Government accountable to its own policy, which recently has been honored more in the breach than the observance. Having extended the safeguards of the Parole Directive to asylum-seekers, ICE must now ensure that such protections are realized.</p>
<p>Our lawsuit names five ICE field offices that just five years ago were granting parole at rates of over 90 percent. Now the government’s own statistics show that these same field offices are denying parole at rates of over 90 percent, resulting in the mass detention of nearly a thousand asylum seekers across the country. The judge stated that the statistics were “irrefutable” and “troubling” evidence that detention in the five field offices “has become the default option.”</p>
<p>Federal agencies have the fundamental obligation to follow the rules they set forth for themselves. The court ordered ICE to give our class members a case-by-case review of their requests for release. Instead of just rejecting those requests out of hand, ICE must now follow its own policies and give each one a meaningful look.</p>
<p>It’s a potentially life-changing second chance for people like Ansly Damus, the lead plaintiff in our lawsuit. An ethics teacher from Haiti, Mr. Damus feared for his life after being brutally attacked and targeted by gangs after speaking out against corruption by a local official. He fled to the United States, where he presented himself to immigration officers and sought asylum.</p>
<p>An immigration judge has actually granted him asylum — not once, but twice — but the government appealed in both instances. He has not committed any crimes and has shown ICE that he had a safe place to live while his case gets resolved. Despite that, Mr. Damus has now been locked up in prison-like conditions for more than a year and a half.</p>
<p>The arbitrary and blanket imprisonment of people like Mr. Damus is just one facet of the Trump administration’s larger strategy of deterring people from seeking refuge in the United States. Other brutal tactics include separating thousands of children from parents who come to our borders fleeing violence, making plans to detain kids in tent cities, and zealously targeting parents for criminal prosecution over the misdemeanor offense of crossing the border between ports of entry. The president himself has taken to Twitter to attack the very principle of due process itself, saying that, “We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came.”</p>
<p>The president may very well believe that he can attack the constitutional rights of immigrants and criminalize asylum seekers in any manner he pleases, but he is mistaken. The courts will continue to hold him to account.</p>
<p>For as Judge Boasberg concluded, “To mandate that ICE provide these baseline procedures to those entering our country — individuals who have often fled violence and persecution to seek safety on our shores — is no great judicial leap.”</p>

<p>web17-SupremeCourtYellow-1160x768.jpg</p>
<p>The first case I litigated before Justice Anthony Kennedy, who announced his retirement on June 27 after more than 30 years on the Supreme Court, was Texas v. Johnson, the 1989 case that established that the First Amendment protects flag-burning. Kennedy, a mild-mannered Reagan appointee, was no flag-burner. But he provided the crucial fifth vote to strike down Texas’s law.</p>
<p>A few years later, I invited him to guest-teach my constitutional-law class at Georgetown. I said he could talk about anything; he chose the flag-burning case. But his real subject was judging. In his hour with the students, he not only stressed the importance of having an open mind, but exemplified it in his openness to the students themselves. Not all judges are like this; Justice Antonin Scalia was always absolutely certain about his views when speaking to students (or to anyone else, for that matter).</p>
<p>I remember arguing to a colleague, a noted gay-rights scholar, that this characteristic meant that Kennedy might be persuaded to vote in favor of other progressive causes. My colleague dismissed the idea, sure that Kennedy would play to type and vote consistently conservative.</p>
<p>Yet it was Kennedy who wrote every one of the Court’s decisions protecting gay and lesbian rights, including pathbreaking decisions striking down a Colorado referendum that barred protection against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and invalidating a Texas law making same-sex “sodomy” a crime. And most importantly, he wrote the majority opinions in United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges, both 5–4 decisions extending constitutional protection to the marriage of same-sex couples. In these and other decisions, he saw in anti-LGBTQ measures a direct affront to the equal dignity of all persons.</p>

<p>web18_familyseparationkids_1160x768.jpg</p>
<p>The continuing cruelty on display at our southern border has unleashed a righteous, primal scream of revulsion from Americans across the ideological spectrum. The outrage, plus a successful ACLU legal effort in San Diego, seems to have helped turn the tide toward family reunification. However, the common refrain seems to be, “This is not who we are,” as if ripping families apart to punish or deter crime is so novel and grotesque that it’s unrecognizable as American.</p>
<p>The truth is that the criminal justice system we are imposing on immigrants is a reflection of the one we impose on our own — and both need fixing. At the border, we are taking children from desperate parents based on misdemeanor border crossing — or based on no illegality at all, if the family has properly presented itself for asylum.</p>
<p>But every day inside the United States, we do a version of this to tens of thousands of our own citizens. Judges and prosecutors impose cash bail that keeps parents locked up and apart from their families prior to trial, and children’s services agencies often remove kids from their parents based on unsubstantiated criminal allegations as proof of parental unfitness.</p>
<p>Every day, roughly 450,000 people are held in jail pretrial — meaning they are presumed innocent of any crime — and a significant portion of those are behind bars because they cannot afford bail. Worse yet, the arrest that resulted in pretrial detention is routinely used to justify a criminal temporary order of protection, or triggers the removal of children by a family court, even before the state proves the crime.</p>

<h2><a class="Two_Years_After_the_Police_Killing_of_Philando_Castile_Justice_Continues_to_Be_Denied_12996"></a>Two Years After the Police Killing of Philando Castile, Justice Continues to Be Denied</h2>
<p class="byline">by: Teresa Nelson</p>

<p class="source">url: <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/two-years-after-police-killing-philando-castile-justice-continues-be-denied">https://www.aclu.org/blog/racial-justice/two-years-after-police-killing-philando-castile-justice-continues-be-denied</a></p>
<p>web18_philandocastillepainting_1160x768.jpg</p>
<p>On July 7, 2016, the day after the shooting of Philando Castile, artists from the Twin Cities came together to create a public mural to process their shock and grief. In stark black and white lettering, the mural asked:</p>
<p>What do we tell our children when education didn’t matter? When compliance, age, or evidence didn’t matter? When guilt or innocence didn’t matter? When our outrage didn’t matter?</p>
<p>The building on which the mural lived was demolished shortly after its painting. But, like Castile, the mural lives on in memories of the community.</p>
<p>Philando Castile was shot and killed by Officer Jeronimo Yanez on July 6, 2016. A year later, Officer Yanez was acquitted of second-degree manslaughter and two counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm. Afterwards, the video footage that the ACLU of Minnesota fought to get released was finally made public. In the video, you see Castile shot unnecessarily by the frantic police officer in front of his girlfriend and her 4-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>Two years later, there is nothing reassuring to tell the hundreds of children at J.J. Hill Montessori Magnet School, where Castile worked for more than a decade. There was no reason for his killing.</p>
<p>But Castile is not the only person that Minnesota community members have had to grieve for in the two years since his killing. Last July, Justine Ruszczyk Damond was shot and killed by Minneapolis Police Officer Mohammed Noor after she called the police to report a possible sexual assault occurring near her home. Gilbert Salas was killed by St. James Police in February of this year. And, just last week, Thurman Blevins was shot by the police in North Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Families, friends, neighbors, and loved ones should not have to continually brace themselves for the next police shooting. Minnesota residents should not have to march in the streets demanding justice, only to have another member of their community shot.</p>
<p>For Minnesota to address the problem of how police use excessive and deadly force, we need to enact large-scale reforms across the state. To start, that means reforming the state law on body cameras. The legislature needs to mandate that all footage of such uses of force is made public as well as to establish minimum standards for body camera deployment by police departments, including mandatory activation, discipline for violating policy, compliance audits, and prohibiting officer review of footage prior to writing initial reports.</p>
<p>The police should not be allowed to hide behind a “criminal investigative data” classification to delay the release of video and audio in police incidents. This type of stonewalling is what is currently preventing us from accessing video and audio of the shooting of Thurman Blevins.</p>
<p>We also need to facilitate investigations and, where appropriate, discipline officers who use excessive force. First, the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training, which is responsible for dispensing occupational licenses to law enforcement, should be empowered to act like every other professional licensing board and conduct its own separate investigations and make its own decisions about actions against an officer’s license.</p>
<p>The legislature also needs to create an independent state agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting police officers who engage in excessive force and other police misconduct. Finally, Minnesota municipalities need to give civilian review boards the authority to investigate and discipline officers who abuse their authority.</p>
<p>But even these reforms may not be sufficient. For example, even when there is footage of police misconduct, like in Castile’s case, it has not led to a conviction of an officer or the revoking of their license. Above all, what we need to do is fundamentally transform the system and change the laws by which we judge police conduct.</p>
<p>Existing legal precedents fail to deter officer misconduct, and it is time for courts to re-examine them. Under the Fourth Amendment, an officer’s subjective reason for pulling somebody over is irrelevant. As long as the officer has any probable cause for the stop, the courts will find the officer is in compliance with the Fourth Amendment. Racial profiling violates the 14th Amendment, but it requires proof of intentional discrimination — something that is very difficult to prove.</p>
<p>So young African-American men like Castile get pulled over time and time again for minor offenses with little or no recourse for the officers who racially profile them. The Fourth Amendment prohibits “unreasonable searches and seizures” and an officer’s record of disproportionate stops of people of color should be part of the equation when courts consider whether a particular stop was reasonable.</p>
<p>And courts looking at excessive force claims often give police every benefit of the doubt. In fact, two recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions, Kisela v. Hughes and County of Los Angeles v. Mendez, give police wide latitude to shoot people, making it even harder to hold police officers accountable in our judicial system.</p>
<p>If Minnesota police continue to refuse to hold officers accountable when they use excessive and deadly force, then we will have to re-evaluate the power and tools that we give to the police and fund alternatives to policing, such as mental health first-responders, restorative justice initiatives, and community-based programs that do not require an armed police response. As the system stands now, so clearly stacked against victims of police violence, that may be our only choice.</p>

<p>Children are crying for their parents while being held in small cages. The attorney general tells us the Bible justifies what we see and the White House press secretary backs him up. Be horrified and angered, but not because this is a new Trump transgression against real American values. America was in the business of separating families long before Trump.</p>
<p>I am not talking about spurious claims that Obama did the same thing or the valid comparisons to how our criminal justice system uses a cash bail system that every day rips children from their families before they or their parents have been convicted of any crime. The true story is that the United States has a well-documented history of breaking up non-white families.</p>
<p>When we sent Japanese Americans to internment camps, families were often separated when fathers were sent hasty relocation orders and forced labor contracts. In some cases, family members (usually the father) had been arrested earlier and sent to a different camp.</p>
<p>Forty years later, the U.S. government apologized, provided reparations of $20,000 to every survivor of those internment camps, and blamed the “grave wrong” on “racial prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.”</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The separating of Native American families was more intentional. America deliberately tried to wipe native culture from our country. According to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian, beginning in the late 1800s, thousands of American Indian children were forcibly sent to government-run or church-run “boarding schools,” where they were taught English and forbidden to speak their native languages.</p>
<p>An exhibit at the museum includes a quote from Richard Henry Pratt, founder of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, stating: “In Indian civilization I am a Baptist, because I believe in immersing the Indian in our civilization and when we get them under, holding them there until they are thoroughly soaked.”</p>
<p>The boarding schools forced children to cut their hair and give up their traditional clothing. Their meaningful native names were replaced with English ones. Their traditional religious practices were forcibly replaced with Christianity. They were taught that their cultures were inferior. Teachers sometimes ridiculed the students’ traditions. These lessons humiliated the students and taught them to be ashamed of their heritage.</p>
<p>“They tell us not to speak in Navajo language. You’re going to school. You’re supposed to only speak English,” John Brown Jr., a Navajo who served in World War II as a code talker by using his Navajo language for tactical communications the Japanese could not decode, told the museum in a 2004 interview. “And it was true. They did practice that, and we got punished if you was caught speaking Navajo.”</p>
<p>And then, of course, America enslaved Blacks for 246 years. Separating enslaved families was done for profit, for punishment, or simply because a seller or buyer wanted it that way in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.</p>
<p>“Destroying families is one of the worst things done during slavery,” said Henry Fernandez, co-founder of the African American Research Collaborative and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. “The federal government maintained these evils through the fugitive slave laws and other rules which defined African Americans as property with which a slave owner could do whatever they wanted.”</p>
<p>Each of these policies, Fernandez said, begins with the assumption “that the idea of family is simply less important to people of color and that the people involved are less than human. To justify ripping families apart, the government must first engage in dehumanizing the targeted group.”</p>
<p>“The Weeping Time” exhibit at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture documents the U.S. history of separating children from parents. “Night and day, you could hear men and women screaming … ma, pa, sister or brother … taken without any warning,” Susan Hamilton, a witness to a slave auction, recalled in a 1938 interview. “People was always dying from a broken heart.”</p>
<p>A report in the Maryland State Archives includes a narrative from a man named Charles Ball, who was enslaved as a child and remembered the day he was sold away from his mother.</p>
<p>“My poor mother, when she saw me leaving her for the last time, ran after me, took me down from the horse, clasped me in her arms, and wept loudly and bitterly over me,” Ball recalled. “My master seemed to pity her and endeavored to soothe her distress by telling her that he would be a good master to me, and that I should not want anything.”</p>
<p>Ball added that when his mother’s persisted, his master hit her with a rawhide whip.</p>
<p>Thousands of former slaves looked for lost relatives and children who had been sold away from their families. They placed thousands of ads in newspapers. Those ads are now being digitized in a project called “Last Seen: Finding Family After Slavery,” which is run by Villanova University’s graduate history program in collaboration with Philadelphia’s Mother Bethel AME Church.</p>
<p>Our history of separating families is no older than our use of the Bible to justify transgressions against humanity. In 1667, Virginia law stated that if an enslaved person became Christian it did not mean freedom because the only way that conversion could happen was through the “charity and piety of their masters.” When Texas withdrew from the union it declared that enslaving people was justified by “the revealed will of the Almighty Creator.” William T. Thompson, the designer of the Confederate Flag said, “As a people, we are fighting to maintain the Heaven-ordained supremacy of the white man over the inferior or colored race.” Jeff Sessions is simply the most recent person to try to justify an indefensible policy by referring to the Bible.</p>
<p>On June 14, Attorney General Jeff Sessions cited biblical scripture Romans 13 to claim support for the Trump administration’s forced separation of immigrant families. “I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained them for the purpose of order,” he said.</p>
<p>As it happens, this is the same passage cited by loyalist preachers who said America should not declare independence from England; it was cited by southerners defending slavery; and, it was cited to defend authoritarian rule in Nazi Germany and South African apartheid.</p>

<p>Children are crying for their parents while being held in small cages. The attorney general tells us the Bible justifies what we see and the White House press secretary backs him up. Be horrified and angered, but not because this is a new Trump transgression against real American values. America was in the business of separating families long before Trump.</p>
<p>I am not talking about spurious claims that Obama did the same thing or the valid comparisons to how our criminal justice system uses a cash bail system that every day rips children from their families before they or their parents have been convicted of any crime. The true story is that the United States has a well-documented history of breaking up non-white families.</p>
<p>When we sent Japanese Americans to internment camps, families were often separated when fathers were sent hasty relocation orders and forced labor contracts. In some cases, family members (usually the father) had been arrested earlier and sent to a different camp.</p>
<p>Forty years later, the U.S. government apologized, provided reparations of $20,000 to every survivor of those internment camps, and blamed the “grave wrong” on “racial prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.”</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>The separating of Native American families was more intentional. America deliberately tried to wipe native culture from our country. According to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian, beginning in the late 1800s, thousands of American Indian children were forcibly sent to government-run or church-run “boarding schools,” where they were taught English and forbidden to speak their native languages.</p>
<p>An exhibit at the museum includes a quote from Richard Henry Pratt, founder of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, stating: “In Indian civilization I am a Baptist, because I believe in immersing the Indian in our civilization and when we get them under, holding them there until they are thoroughly soaked.”</p>
<p>The boarding schools forced children to cut their hair and give up their traditional clothing. Their meaningful native names were replaced with English ones. Their traditional religious practices were forcibly replaced with Christianity. They were taught that their cultures were inferior. Teachers sometimes ridiculed the students’ traditions. These lessons humiliated the students and taught them to be ashamed of their heritage.</p>
<p>“They tell us not to speak in Navajo language. You’re going to school. You’re supposed to only speak English,” John Brown Jr., a Navajo who served in World War II as a code talker by using his Navajo language for tactical communications the Japanese could not decode, told the museum in a 2004 interview. “And it was true. They did practice that, and we got punished if you was caught speaking Navajo.”</p>
<p>And then, of course, America enslaved Blacks for 246 years. Separating enslaved families was done for profit, for punishment, or simply because a seller or buyer wanted it that way in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries.</p>

<p>ATLANTA (WJBF) - When Jerry Coen was cuffed, he lost not only his freedom but the most basic ability to communicate for 10 years.</p>
<p>“I went to jail and I was still handcuffed behind my back,” Jerry tells me through his interpreter, Scott Huffman. “People thought I was crazy but all I was trying to do was trying communicate with them. I was trying to use body language.”</p>
<p>Jerry did not have an interpreter at his arrest, when he was taken into jail, or when he signed a plea deal that put him in prison for a decade.</p>
<p>Once he was behind bars, he says he was repeatedly put in “the hole”–that’s solitary confinement–for insubordination after not following verbal orders:</p>
<p>“It’s very dark, you can’t see,” Jerry tells me. “It’s like extra punishment, its like abuse.”</p>
<p>“Imagine living in a world where you cannot understand what’s going on around you,” says Sean Young, Legal Director at ACLU of GA. “Where people are telling you to do things that you don’t understand, and then punishing you for breaking those rules.”</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims Jerry couldn’t take anger management classes to try to correct himself because the Corrections Department refused to provide an interpreter.</p>
<p>Another plaintiff says he was told he could not have an interpreter because “English is the official language of Georgia” and he could learn to deal with it.</p>
<p>The suit claims that prisoners couldn’t take the basic classes available to all other prisoners, classes necessary for parole.</p>
<p>“Deaf people in Georgia prisons are in prisons longer essentially because they’re deaf,” Sean Young tells me. “This is not the kind of Georgia most people want to live in. It’s cruel, it’s unnecessary and it does nothing to protect our community.”</p>
<p>“Hearing guys in there and they can call family. They seem joyous and excited but for us deaf folks we have to wonder what’s going on with our family and we’re sad. Really isolated and disconnected,” Jerry tells me.</p>
<p>And it’s not only about what deaf prisoners don’t get to do, but what’s done to them.</p>
<p>Jerry claims his hearing aid, which allowed him to hear vibrations of loud noises, was stepped on and crushed by a guard.</p>
<p>He also says he tried repeatedly to communicate in writing, but for him and other prisoners, those notes were thrown away right in front of him:</p>
<p>“Guards know people like Mr. Coen are deaf and cannot verbally communicate. If a deaf person in prison communicates in a piece of writing and the prison guard does this (pretends to crumple and throw away paper) and throws it away, it’s hard not to jump to the conclusion that they’re doing this to be cruel,” says Young.</p>
<p>The suit specifically alleges that the Georgia Department of Corrections has violated prisoners’ Fourth and Eighth Amendment rights, as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>The attorney filing the suit said they aren’t looking for special treatment for deaf prisoners, just the same equal access as others.</p>
<p>Since the suit was filed on Wednesday, I’ve repeatedly reached out to GDOC but have received no response.</p>
<p>Stay informed</p>
