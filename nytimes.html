<h2 id="thedigitalsexlivesofyounggayteenagers">The Digital Sex Lives of Young Gay Teenagers</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Jack Turban</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-12</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/opinion/grindr-gay-teenagers-sex-apps.html </p>

<p>Pekic/iStock, via Getty Images Plus</p>

<p>Last summer in Wisconsin, a mother came home to find her 15-year-old son running up the stairs from their basement. He yelled that a man had broken into the house and raped him. A police officer apprehended Eugene Gross, who was 51 years old and H.I.V. positive, in a nearby backyard.</p>

<p>Authorities later learned that the teenager had met Mr. Gross on the gay hookup app Grindr and that they had met for sex before. Last month, Mr. Gross was sentenced to 15 years. The victim’s father broke down in court, saying, “The man sitting here, he destroyed my life, my kid’s life, my family life.”</p>

<p>It’s common for gay, bisexual or questioning minors to go online to meet other gay people. It’s normal for these kids to want to explore intimacy. But most online social networks for gay men are geared toward adults and focused on sex. They have failed to protect minors, who simply have to subtract a few years from their birth date to create a profile.</p>

<p>Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a new study in The Journal of Adolescent Health together suggest that roughly one in four gay and bisexual boys aged 14 to 17 in the United States are on gay hookup apps designed for adults (Grindr, Scruff, Jack’d, Adam4Adam). Sixty-nine percent of them have had sex with someone they met through these apps. Only 25 percent use condoms consistently.</p>

<p>Gay kids, especially closeted ones, don’t necessarily have the opportunities for intimacy that straight kids do: classroom Valentines and first prom dates. So they go online. Though they may be looking for friends or boyfriends, they mostly find sex.</p>

<p>On Grindr, it’s common to receive unsolicited naked pictures. A minor can make a profile within minutes and instantly start chatting with adult men who live nearby.</p>

<p>Teenagers are still developing their abilities to delay gratification and control their impulses. With just 12 percent of millennials reporting that their sex education classes covered same-sex relationships, it’s not surprising that many end up having unprotected sex.</p>

<p>Should apps like Grindr be held accountable when minors use them? Dr. Elizabeth Englander, a psychologist and expert on the digital lives of minors, thinks yes: “It’s an ethical line and a no-brainer.”</p>

<p>Grindr’s terms of service state that users must be 18 or older, and the app requires everyone to enter a birth date to join. But it could certainly do more to try to verify ages. Some gambling sites, for instance, make users upload a credit card or ID to prove their age. But this brings up confidentiality risks for gay men who don’t want to be outed.</p>

<p>Grindr could also use algorithms to detect conversations between minors and adults. This would require employees to manually verify which conversations were inappropriate, but given that Grindr’s annual revenue may be as high as $77 million, the company could probably afford it.</p>

<p>When asked to comment, Grindr’s chief technology officer and president, Scott Chen, said that Grindr is “in the process of testing further safeguards for our account creation procedures to help ensure authentic and proper account activity, including verification through social media platforms.” He said the company takes the issue very seriously, is working on improving its screening tools and encourages users to continue reporting any “illegal or improper activity.”</p>

<p>This is heartening, but it isn’t enough. Age verification through social media is hardly foolproof, since minors can lie about their age on Facebook, too.</p>

<p>In 2015, a man who had been arrested for having sex with a 13-year-old boy sued Grindr, claiming that its weak enforcement of age restrictions was to blame for the sexual encounter. The lawsuit was dismissed because Grindr is protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which means it isn’t responsible for what users say on its app (including minors lying about their age).</p>

<p>And Grindr is hardly the only problem — there are many similar venues. When I searched online for “gay chat,” as a lonely, closeted child might, the first hit was #1 Chat Avenue. Two minutes after I opened a gay chat room, a user wrote: “Any boys 13 or 14 with cameras? I’m 35.” After some deep searching, I found that you can report activity like this to moderators, but they aren’t always online. I reported it to the site’s administrator via email, but I never heard back.</p>

<p>In the end, it is largely up to parents to protect their children. Unfortunately, this topic combines two of many parents’ greatest fears: sex and technology.</p>

<p>Parents can block apps like Grindr. But kids almost always outsmart us, and it’s probably better to educate them in addition to using parental controls.</p>

<p>Dr. Englander tells parents not to try to be experts on the technology. “Parents can instead be the experts on the importance of deeper in-person relationships,” she says. Explain to children that while what they find online may be exciting or interesting, they never know who’s on the other side.</p>

<p>Children need to hear that naked photos and videos are permanent (even when sent on Snapchat). They should know that sex between a minor and an adult is illegal. They need to be told that it’s dangerous to meet up with a person from the internet and that if they do so, they need to tell their parents and meet the person in a public place. They need to know the risk of infections from unprotected sex.</p>

<p>Parents also need to stay calm, so that the kids feel comfortable coming back to them if they ever end up in a bad situation, like if a scary stranger won’t stop messaging.</p>

<p>As a society, we have failed to create enough spaces for gay youth to thrive, pushing them online and underground. While we try to find ways to hold digital sites accountable, we need to talk to our kids about how to be safe online.</p>

<h2 id="pencereachesouttoevangelicalsnotallofthemreachback">Pence Reaches Out to Evangelicals. Not All of Them Reach Back.</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Elizabeth Dias</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-12</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/13/us/politics/southern-baptist-convention-pence.html </p>

<p>Vice President Mike Pence spoke at the Southern Baptist Convention in Dallas on Wednesday.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — In the latest sign of the Trump administration’s outreach to religious conservatives ahead of a critical midterm election, Vice President Mike Pence told a large gathering of pastors Wednesday that the White House would continue to fight for evangelical priorities. He appealed for the community’s continued support, even as his appearance led to complaints that a religious event was being used for political gain.</p>

<p>“This is a pivotal year in the life of our nation,” Mr. Pence told the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, where nearly 10,000 evangelical pastors gathered in Dallas. “Be assured of this, President Trump and I are going to continue to fight for what we know is right.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pence recited a list of Trump administration actions that appealed to the conservative evangelical community, which constitutes one of the president’s biggest blocs of supporters. Among the accomplishments he cited were the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court; advancing anti-abortion priorities across the government; opening an American embassy in Jerusalem; passing tax reform; and freeing Christian hostages from North Korea.</p>

<p>“This progress,” Mr. Pence said, “is the result of the support of men and women like so many of you, who supported our president not only in 2016 but every day since.”</p>

<p>The Southern Baptist Convention’s annual gathering in June draws thousands of evangelical influencers from across the country, presenting a rich opportunity for the administration to reach one of its most supportive voter bases. More than 80 percent of white evangelicals voted for Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence in 2016, and Southern Baptist churches have more than 15 million members.</p>

<p>While the convention has at times had Republican leaders speak, its stated purpose is to focus on evangelism and missionary work. But Mr. Pence mentioned “the president” more than three dozen times in his 30 minute speech.</p>

<p>“There is only one way you can sum up this administration,” he said. “It has been 500 days of promises made and promises kept.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pence was not originally on the convention’s schedule, but his office reached out to the group’s leadership to express interest in participating, and he was announced as a speaker earlier this week. A White House official said that his appearance was first discussed several weeks ago.</p>

<p>Last week, Mr. Pence addressed the Faith and Freedom Coalition’s Road to Majority conference, and he has addressed the March for Life twice since taking office. On Thursday morning, he is scheduled to speak to the National Hispanic Prayer Breakfast and Conference in Washington.</p>

<p>But the Trump presidency does not inspire lockstep allegiance among evangelicals, and that divide was evident this week in Dallas. On Tuesday, open protest over Mr. Pence’s participation broke out on the convention floor, when some pastors made several motions to prevent the vice president from addressing the group. Some were especially concerned about the administration’s stance on immigration and race, and Mr. Pence’s allegiance to a president who has been accused of multiple instances of sexual misconduct.</p>

<p>Garrett Kell, a pastor from Alexandria, Va., proposed using the time allotted to Mr. Pence for a prayer session, to avoid sending a signal that evangelical faith is aligned with the Trump administration. The measure failed to pass, but, significantly, a third of the attendees voted to support his proposal.</p>

<p>Some pastors decided to not attend the vice president’s speech in protest, and said they would pray instead. Cam Triggs, a pastor in Orlando, Fla., who started the Grace Alive church last year and who supported a resolution at the convention on racial reconciliation, said several factors prompted him to skip the vice president’s speech.</p>

<p>“As a minority, I definitely feel hurt by this particular allowance for him to speak at the convention, by the insensitivity of remarks by the administration,” Mr. Triggs, 30, said in an interview, alluding to topics like immigration. For some people, he added, “It can appear as campaign mobilization.”</p>

<p>Dean Inserra, who leads City Church in Tallahassee, Fla., a 1,000-person congregation comprising mostly young people, said that much of the pushback on Mr. Pence’s appearance came from nonwhite pastors. “Right now, the reputation we have is an organization of Trump supporters,” he said in an interview. “It shows the world that we are more of a voting bloc for the GOP, and that is really unfortunate.”</p>

<p>But the majority of attendees supported Mr. Pence’s participation. He received several standing ovations, and someone even called out, “Four more years!” as he started to speak. “That says so much about this administration, that he would want to come and express his appreciation to us for all that we do,” Brandon Park, who leads Connection Point Church in Raytown, Mo., said in an interview.</p>

<p>Evangelicals hear what they want to about the Trump administration, he said, adding “It’s like Yanny versus Laurel.”</p>

<h2 id="restrainingorderissuedagainststanleessupposedguardian">Restraining Order Issued Against Stan Lee’s Supposed Guardian</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Matt Stevens</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-13</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/arts/stan-lee-restraining-order-keya-morgan.html </p>

<p>Stan Lee, left, and Keya Morgan earlier this year. Mr. Morgan was arrested and charged with filing a false report in connection with Mr. Lee, and was accused by a lawyer of “unduly influencing” him.</p>

<p>A court in Los Angeles issued a temporary restraining order on Wednesday against a man who has claimed to be a caregiver for the Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee, court documents and a lawyer for Mr. Lee said.</p>

<p>The court order came just two days after the Los Angeles police say they arrested the man, Keya Morgan, and booked him into jail on a warrant charging him with filing a false report in connection with Mr. Lee, who is 95. Mr. Morgan was released on bond, according to court documents.</p>

<p>The developments mark the latest bizarre turn in the strange mix of tragedy and scandal that have engulfed Mr. Lee, the co-creator of Spider-Man, X-Men and Black Panther, since the death of his wife, Joan Lee, in July.</p>

<p>In court documents, Tom Lallas, a lawyer who said he had agreed to act as “guardian ad litem” for Mr. Lee, said Mr. Lee suffered from hearing, vision and memory impairments and was unable to “resist undue influence.” He said Mr. Lee’s estate was worth more than $50 million, making him vulnerable to financial predators.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan, Mr. Lallas alleges in court documents, is “a memorabilia collector who inserted himself into Mr. Lee’s life as his caregiver” after the passing of Mr. Lee’s wife. “Petitioner, along with law enforcement and Adult Protective Services, believes that Mr. Morgan is unduly influencing Mr. Lee and isolating him.”</p>

<p>Attempts to contact Mr. Morgan, 42, on Wednesday were unsuccessful. But the celebrity news website TMZ quoted him as saying: “I have taken great care of Stan Lee for the past many years, and have never had a problem directly with Stan. I have a fantastic relationship with him for the past many years, as he has stated countless times on the record, and I literally saved his life once.”</p>

<p>He added: “I will 100 percent prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the allegations against me are false. And I will definitely take legal action against anyone who is making up these lies. The truth will come out.”</p>

<p>In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Josh Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, confirmed Mr. Morgan’s arrest on Monday and said that investigation was continuing. He declined to elaborate, but noted that the police were not conducting an elder abuse investigation related to Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>In a probable cause arrest warrant and police documents, a Los Angeles police detective said that he, along with another detective and a Los Angeles County Adult Protective Services social worker, went to perform a welfare check on Mr. Lee on May 30.</p>

<p>When they arrived at his home, they told security personnel to refuse entry to anyone who came calling on Mr. Lee during the interview, the documents said. Soon after that, Mr. Morgan arrived and was refused entry, after being told by a security guard that detectives and the social worker were inside.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan then called 911 and reported that three “unidentified” people had gone into Mr. Lee’s home and “locked everyone out,” according to a transcript of the 911 call.</p>

<p>“I’m very, very scared they’re harming him,” he said, according to the transcript.</p>

<p>“It’s an emergency,” he added later. “If you could please send someone immediately.”</p>

<p>In his report, the police detective said Mr. Morgan appeared to have withheld information about who was inside to the 911 operator. The detective also said he had interviewed Mr. Lee twice this year and that Mr. Lee has shown that he can be “influenced” by Mr. Morgan. During interviews, Mr. Lee “acknowledged how Morgan has helped him, but would forget Morgan’s name when speaking of him,” the detective wrote.</p>

<p>No one at Los Angeles County’s agency for aging and adult services answered the phone Wednesday night, and it was not possible to leave a message.</p>

<p>Not long after the first call, police documents and 911 call transcripts said, Mr. Morgan called 911 again, this time telling an operator that there was a “very threatening” and “aggressive” man with a gun at Mr. Lee’s home, whom Mr. Morgan wished removed. The detective wrote that the call was made to try to remove a security guard who had refused to sign a nondisclosure agreement that Mr. Morgan had prepared.</p>

<p>The call prompted at least eight police units and a helicopter to respond, police documents said. The security guard was released from custody after the police found no evidence of a crime.</p>

<p>The temporary restraining order — which bars Mr. Morgan from abusing, harassing or contacting Mr. Lee, and requires that he stay at least 100 yards away from him — was granted and signed on Wednesday and is set to expire at the end of a court hearing scheduled for July 6.</p>

<p>Over the last year, rumors about Mr. Lee and the behavior of those around him have swirled. Suspicions have emerged that millions of dollars have been siphoned from his accounts, as have reports that a former business associate stole his blood to sell to fans.</p>

<p>Then, in April, The Hollywood Reporter published an investigation that said that Mr. Lee had been the victim of “elder abuse.” A radio talk show in Orlando, Fla., even broadcast a rumor that he was being “held captive” by handlers who “have him basically locked up in the house.”</p>

<p>But on a recent visit to Mr. Lee’s home, Mr. Lee told The New York Times otherwise.</p>

<p>“I’m the luckiest guy in the world,” Mr. Lee said. “Nobody has more freedom.”</p>

<p>The story noted that Mr. Morgan was Mr. Lee’s “current gatekeeper,” who had ousted former staff members. He sat at Mr. Lee’s side during the interview.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/opinion/children-parents-asylum-immigration.html </p>

<p>Before being sent to a processing center for possible separation, a Honduran asylum seeker and her 2-year-old waited as U.S. Border Patrol agents reviewed their papers.</p>

<p>It may be hard to believe that this is happening in the United States in 2018, that hundreds of children are being snatched from their parents, frequently under false pretenses, often screaming, and placed in vast warehouselike centers like the former Walmart in Brownsville, Tex., where nearly 1,500 boys now spend their days. The parents often don’t know where their children are, or when they will see them again.</p>

<p>In 2014 the Obama administration detained hundreds of families and unaccompanied minors crossing the border, a practice that the federal courts quickly curtailed. But separating families as a matter of unofficial policy is something new and malicious, a function of President Trump’s obsession with undocumented immigrants. This spring, the administration ordered that everyone caught crossing illegally into the United States be prosecuted. And since children cannot accompany grown-ups to jail, people who had crossed illegally with children had their children taken away. Hundreds upon hundreds of children, of all ages, creating a new industry in mass shelters.</p>

<p>The United Nations human rights office called this new practice a serious violation of the rights of children and demanded an immediate halt. Catholic bishops denounced it as immoral. The American Psychological Association warned that the separations threatened the mental and physical health of the children. All to no avail.</p>

<p>The administration has come back with a mix of just-following-orders and falsehoods. The Department of Homeland Security said it had no policy for separating families; it was just catching criminals. President Trump feigned sympathy for the separations but claimed he was the victim of “bad legislation passed by the Democrats,” which nobody could find. Only John Kelly, the White House chief of staff, offered what appeared to be a plausible, if shocking, explanation: that separating parents from their children could be a “tough deterrent.”</p>

<p>The heartlessness of that is mind-boggling. It seems to elude the administration and its cheerleaders that this is not about crime or security, but about the most elemental human values; that ordering armed border guards to cruelly and needlessly rip children from mothers — in one case, while she was breast-feeding the child — goes against fundamental American values and undercuts its standing in the world.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has the opportunity to do the right thing here. If you want to help sway it to do so, here are some concrete steps to take.</p>

<p>Call Congress. Find out who represents you in Washington, and let them know you want the practice of family separation to end. Ask them to support bills that will help reunited children already taken from their parents and also prohibit future removals. Those include the Senate’s HELP Separated Children Act and Keep Families Together Act. The American Civil Liberties Union offers a script for calling the Senate, though we suspect most callers will be able to find the right words themselves.</p>

<p>Join protests. People are taking to the streets in communities across the country Thursday to register their outrage at this border policy. Join these or future actions.</p>

<p>Donate to legal and humanitarian efforts. Immigrants, even children, have no guarantee of legal representation as they pursue asylum or face deportation. Most do not know their rights or speak English well enough to represent themselves. In 75 percent of cases where children had counsel, an immigration judge determined they had a strong enough claim for asylum or humanitarian protection and allowed them to stay in the United States.</p>

<p>The proposed Fair Day in Court for Kids Act would require the government to appoint counsel to unaccompanied children, and it’s important to ask Congress to support its passage. Until then, there are several nonprofits providing vital free legal aid that need financial support: The Texas Civil Rights Project; the Florence Project in Arizona; and Kids in Need of Defense and The Young Center, which work nationwide. Lawyers might also consider lending their expertise. The Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas is helping families with supplies and humanitarian relief.</p>

<p>Vote. Your 2018 primary election may be coming up soon. Please be sure to register and vote. Elections are ultimately the most important tool Americans have to seek change in how their government operates — and the values it espouses.</p>

<h2 id="newyorkattorneygeneralsuestrumpfoundationafter2yearinvestigation">New York Attorney General Sues Trump Foundation After 2-Year Investigation</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Danny Hakim</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-13</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/nyregion/trump-foundation-lawsuit-attorney-general.html </p>

<p>Donald J. Trump at a 2016 campaign event in Iowa where he raised roughly $2.8 million for his foundation.</p>

<p>The New York State attorney general’s office filed a scathingly worded lawsuit on Thursday taking aim at the Donald J. Trump Foundation, accusing the charity and the Trump family of sweeping violations of campaign finance laws, self-dealing and illegal coordination with the presidential campaign.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, which seeks to dissolve the foundation and bar President Trump and three of his children from serving on nonprofit organizations, was an extraordinary rebuke of a sitting president. The attorney general also sent referral letters to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission for possible further action, adding to Mr. Trump’s extensive legal challenges.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, culminated a nearly two-year investigation of Mr. Trump’s charity, which became a subject of scrutiny during and after the 2016 presidential campaign. While such foundations are supposed to be devoted to charitable activities, the petition asserts that Mr. Trump’s was often improperly used to settle legal claims against his various businesses, even spending $10,000 on a portrait of Mr. Trump that was hung at one of his golf clubs.</p>

<p>The foundation was also used to curry political favor, the lawsuit asserts. During the 2016 race, the foundation became a virtual arm of Mr. Trump’s campaign, email traffic showed, with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, directing its expenditures, even though such foundations are explicitly prohibited from political activities.</p>

<p>The attorney general’s office is seeking the Trump Foundation to pay $2.8 million in restitution, the amount raised for the foundation at a 2016 Iowa political fund-raiser. At the time, Mr. Trump skipped a Republican debate and set up his own event to raise money for veterans, though he used the event to skewer his opponents and celebrate his own accomplishments.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump immediately attacked the lawsuit, characterizing it in a Twitter post as an attempt by the “sleazy New York Democrats” to damage him by suing the foundation, and vowing not to settle the case — much as he did when the same office filed a lawsuit accusing Trump University. (Mr. Trump in 2016 paid a $25 million settlement to resolve the inquiry.)</p>

<p>Donald Trump Jr., left, Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump at an Eric Trump Foundation event in 2015.</p>

<p>The $10,000 portrait of Mr. Trump was one of “at least five self-dealing transactions” facilitated by the foundation, according to the attorney general’s office, violating tax regulations that prohibit using nonprofit charities for private interests.</p>

<p>In 2007, to settle a dispute between the City of Palm Beach and Mr. Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, the foundation paid $100,000 to the Fisher House Foundation, another charity.</p>

<p>In 2012, a man named Martin B. Greenberg sued the Trump National Golf Club after he made a hole in one at a fund-raising golf tournament that had promised to pay $1 million to golfers who aced the 13th hole, as he did. As part of a settlement, the charitable foundation paid $158,000 to a foundation run by Mr. Greenberg.</p>

<p>The foundation also paid $5,000 to one organization for “promotional space featuring Trump International Hotels,” and another $32,000 to satisfy a pledge made by a privately held entity controlled by Mr. Trump to a charitable land trust.</p>

<p>The foundation lawsuit, and the referrals to the federal agencies, are the latest of Mr. Trump’s voluminous legal challenges, starting with the ongoing investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into ties between Mr. Trump, his associates and Russia.</p>

<p>The attorney general’s action is also likely to embolden critics who have accused Mr. Trump of flouting legal norms. Mr. Trump has suggested he might pardon himself in the Mueller investigation and has repeatedly assailed the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>“As our investigation reveals, the Trump Foundation was little more than a checkbook for payments from Mr. Trump or his businesses to nonprofits, regardless of their purpose or legality,” said Barbara D. Underwood, New York’s attorney general, who has been on the job a little over a month. “This is not how private foundations should function and my office intends to hold the foundation accountable for its misuse of charitable assets.”</p>

<p>Many of the examples cited in the lawsuit were first reported by The Washington Post.</p>

<p>Numerous state and federal laws preclude nonprofit organizations and charities like the Trump Foundation from lobbying, aiding a political campaign, or giving undue benefits that further a person’s self-interests, rather than those of the organization. The restrictions are in place to ensure that donations are used for the expressed purpose of the nonprofits; violations can result in penalties, including revocation of the organization’s nonprofit status.</p>

<p>The petition notes that Mr. Trump himself signed annual I.R.S. filings, under penalty of perjury, in which he attested that the foundation did not engage in political activity. “This statutory prohibition is absolute.”</p>

<p>Yet after the Iowa fund-raiser, Mr. Trump’s foundation “ceded control over the charitable funds it raised to senior Trump campaign staff, who dictated the manner in which the foundation would disburse those proceeds, directing the timing, amounts and recipients of the grants,” according to the petition.</p>

<p>That same month, an official at the foundation emailed Mr. Lewandowski, who was Mr. Trump’s campaign manager at the time, telling him “we should start thinking about how you want to distribute the funds collected.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lewandowski, in a reply, wrote that “I think we should get the total collected and then put out a press release that we distributed the $$ to each of the groups.” He later sent a list of veterans’ groups “purportedly approved by Mr. Trump to receive grants from the Foundation.”</p>

<p>The full text of the petition the New York Attorney General filed against the Donald J. Trump Foundation.</p>

<p>41 pages, 2.06 MB </p>

<p>The list was created by another campaign staffer, Lisa Maciejowski Gambuzza, and edited by a third, Stuart Jolly, a political director. And Mr. Lewandowski asked that some of the disbursements be made in Iowa in the days before that state’s presidential nominating caucuses, which mark the kickoff of the primary calendar.</p>

<p>Allowing the campaign to control the spending of the foundation’s charitable funds represented coordination between the two entities, as well as “an improper in-kind contribution of no less than $2.823 million (the amount donated to the foundation) to the campaign,” according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>Beyond the restitution, the foundation and its directors could face several million dollars in additional penalties, depending on how the court rules. The attorney general’s office is also seeking to bar the president from serving as a director, officer or trustee of another nonprofit for 10 years.</p>

<p>Likewise, the petition seeks to bar Mr. Trump’s three eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric, from the boards of nonprofits based in New York or that operate in New York for one year, which would have the effect of barring them from a wide range of groups based in other states.</p>

<p>While the three eldest children ostensibly served on the foundation board from 2006 to 2017, the board never even met after 1999, according to the petition, which called the foundation “an empty shell that functions with no oversight by its board of directors.”</p>

<p>The action could force Mr. Trump’s children to curtail relationships with a variety of organizations. Last year, for example, Ms. Trump said she created a charitable fund, the Ivanka M. Trump Charitable Fund, to receive the unpaid portion of her book advance and any future royalties. In her government ethics report disclosed on Monday, she said she donated $289,300 to the fund. However, no publicly filed reports are available for that group yet.</p>

<p>The letters the New York Attorney General sent to the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission detailing accusations against the Donald J. Trump Foundation.</p>

<p>22 pages, 1.92 MB </p>

<p>After the election, Eric Trump distanced himself from his charitable foundation, which has also been under investigation by the attorney general’s office related to shifting its resources to the Trump Organization.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump long feuded with Ms. Underwood’s predecessor, Eric Schneiderman, who resigned last month amid a scandal involving allegations that he had physically abused a number of his girlfriends. Weeks after the 2016 election, Mr. Schneiderman’s office issued a “notice of violation” to the foundation, which had already attracted scrutiny over its practices, and ordered it to immediately stop soliciting charitable donations in the state.</p>

<p>Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, released a statement from the Trump Foundation on Thursday that characterized the lawsuit as “politics at its very worst.” The statement accused Mr. Schneiderman of using the foundation investigation “to not only advance his own political goals, but also for his own political fund-raising,” and suggested that Ms. Underwood has shown that “such political attacks will continue unabated.”</p>

<p>Mr. Schneiderman’s resignation had raised questions whether his office, which had been at the heart of the Democratic legal resistance against the Trump administration, would persist in such efforts.</p>

<p>By filing the lawsuit, Ms. Underwood, who is a career prosecutor rather than a politician, seems inclined to do so.</p>

<p>She also recently accused Mr. Trump of “undermining the rule of law” with his pardon practices. She made the comment when she announced she was continuing an effort begun under Mr. Schneiderman to change New York’s double-jeopardy law so that state and local prosecutors would have the power to bring criminal charges against aides to Mr. Trump who have been pardoned.</p>

<p>The Trump Foundation has been in legal limbo since after the election, when the president wanted to dissolve it amid growing controversy about its practices. But in late 2016, a spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, Amy Spitalnick, said the foundation “cannot legally dissolve” while it is under investigation.</p>

<p>The attorney general’s referrals to the I.R.S. and the F.E.C. could add another wrinkle that might slow the foundation’s dissolution. The agencies are not known for their expeditious handling of enforcement actions, and the lawsuit notes that the foundation cannot legally complete its wind down “until the complaints to the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Election Commission have been resolved and it is determined if any penalties or fines will be imposed on the foundation.”</p>

<h2 id="reportgivestrumpanopeningbutundercutshisnarrative">Report Gives Trump an Opening, but Undercuts His Narrative</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Peter Baker</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-13</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/us/politics/inspector-general-report-trump.html </p>

<p>President Trump on Wednesday at Joint Base Andrews near Washington.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The report that had much of Washington buzzing on Thursday required 500 pages to outline its findings, but to President Trump, three words mattered most — “we’ll stop it.”</p>

<p>Those were the words that a senior F.B.I. agent texted in August 2016 to a colleague who was worried that Mr. Trump would win the election. For the president, that text seemed to validate his claim of a “deep state” conspiracy out to get him.</p>

<p>But the same inspector general report also undercut Mr. Trump’s narrative. Whatever the agent, Peter Strzok, meant, the F.B.I. did not “stop” Mr. Trump, nor did the inspector general find evidence it tried. To the extent that the F.B.I. and its director at the time, James B. Comey, did anything wrong in 2016, according to the report, it was to the disadvantage of Mr. Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>The sprawling report, the most comprehensive look back at the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s use of an unclassified private email server, reflected a messier reality than the simple story line promoted by the White House: An array of senior officials at the F.B.I. and the Justice Department made mistakes, the inspector general determined, but he found nothing to conclude that anyone went easy on Mrs. Clinton or tried to harm Mr. Trump out of political bias.</p>

<p>If anything, the report affirmed the complaints that Mrs. Clinton and her team have lodged against Mr. Comey — that he went too far by criticizing her conduct while declining to bring charges, and that he erred by disclosing days before the election that he was reopening the inquiry while never revealing an investigation into contacts between Mr. Trump’s campaign and Russia.</p>

<p>“A fair reading of the report shows that the F.B.I. applied a double standard to the Clinton and Trump investigations that was unfair to Clinton and helped elect Trump,” said John D. Podesta, who was Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman. “That said, he’ll use one random Strzok email to spin a deep-state conspiracy which plays to his core.”</p>

<p>Any independent criticism of Mr. Comey — even though for his treatment of Mrs. Clinton — helps Mr. Trump undermine the credibility of someone who may be a crucial witness against him in any case of obstruction of justice arising from the president’s decision to fire the F.B.I. director last year.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Comey, who was then leading the investigation into contacts between Russia and the president’s team, that led to the appointment of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.</p>

<p>“Any report which critiques former senior F.B.I. employees of both Robert Mueller and James Comey and are being used by Mueller as prime witnesses against President Trump is inherently a winner for the president,” said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser. “The I.G. report continues the delegitimization of the entire Mueller investigation, which is ultimately the fruit of the poisonous and disgruntled James Comey.”</p>

<p>Mr. Trump initially cited letters from his attorney general and deputy attorney general faulting Mr. Comey’s handling of the investigation into Mrs. Clinton as the reason for firing him. But the next day, the president acknowledged that he would have done it even without the letters and that he was thinking about the Russia investigation at the time.</p>

<p>More recently, his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, said one reason Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey was that the F.B.I. director would not publicly exonerate the president in the Russia inquiry.</p>

<p>The report released Thursday did not examine the origins of the Russia investigation, which Mr. Trump has called into question. But it will be used to shape the perception of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump remained uncharacteristically quiet about the report in the hours after it was released, and his spokeswoman offered just a terse reaction to it.</p>

<p>“It reaffirmed the president’s suspicions about Comey’s conduct and the political bias among some members of the F.B.I.,” said Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.</p>

<p>Jennifer Palmieri, who was the communications director for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, said that “perversely” the report will help Mr. Trump on the margins by tarnishing the F.B.I.</p>

<p>“The report won’t move anyone who doesn’t already agree with Trump,” she said. “A nonbiased person can clearly see the F.B.I.’s actions only served to help Trump.”</p>

<p>Robert Bauer, who was White House counsel under President Barack Obama, said Mr. Trump will pick out findings he considers beneficial to his argument.</p>

<p>“How much this report helps Mr. Trump depends on how successfully in the short term he mischaracterizes its findings,” Mr. Bauer said. “But in the long run, the report stands as a conclusive rebuttal to his persistent claims that Hillary Clinton violated the law and escaped only because the investigation was somehow rigged.”</p>

<p>Yet while the report did not find that bias influenced the investigation, it did find that five F.B.I. employees assigned to the investigation into Mrs. Clinton expressed “statements of hostility toward then candidate Trump and statements of support for candidate Clinton.” Those employees “brought discredit to themselves” and “cast a cloud” over the investigation.</p>

<p>Among them was Mr. Strzok, the senior F.B.I. agent who sent the “we’ll stop it” text to Lisa Page, a senior F.B.I. lawyer. Mr. Strzok went from the Clinton investigation to the Russia investigation, but was moved off the case by Mr. Mueller last year after other political texts came to light. Ms. Page left her job this spring.</p>

<p>He sent her the “we’ll stop it” message after she texted him asking if Mr. Trump might really become president. Questioned by the inspector general, Mr. Strzok said that he did not remember the message but that it would have been meant to reassure Ms. Page that Mr. Trump would not win, not to indicate that he would use his job to influence the election.</p>

<p>Moreover, Mr. Strzok told the inspector general that if the F.B.I. were trying to harm Mr. Trump’s chances, it would have revealed its then-secret investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia before the election, which it did not. The report further noted that Mr. Strzok and Ms. Page advocated more aggressive measures in the Clinton inquiry.</p>

<p>But allies of Mr. Trump said Mr. Strzok and other agents failed to follow up immediately on new emails found in fall 2016 on a laptop belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the husband of an aide to Mrs. Clinton, because they were busy with the Russia investigation.</p>

<p>“Peter Strzok and the investigative team made a decision to go one direction which would be more damaging to this president than following up on other leads as it relates to Hillary Clinton,” Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, said on Fox News.</p>

<p>The F.B.I. delayed by several weeks looking into Mr. Weiner’s laptop. As a result, Mr. Comey’s announcement that he was reopening the email investigation came just days before the election and dominated the final days of the campaign.</p>

<p>In the end, the F.B.I. found nothing new on Mr. Weiner’s laptop that changed the decision not to charge Mrs. Clinton. But Mr. Strzok proved to be wrong. Neither he nor anyone else could stop Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump delivers remarks on Monday at a rally in West Columbia, S.C.</p>

<p>HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL, KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II, IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY, EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON’T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS &amp; SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME. WIN!</p>

<p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 27, 2018</p>

<p>The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats, who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime, well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres.</p>

<p>— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2018</p>

<p>“The Democrats want open borders. They want anybody they wanted, including MS-13, pouring into the country.” </p>

<p>the facts</p>

<p>False. </p>

<p>Democrats have argued that building a wall on the southwestern border is ineffective and a waste of resources, and rejected hard-line proposals to limit legal immigration. But Mr. Trump is grossly exaggerating Democrats’ positions when he conflates their opposition to his signature campaign promise and immigration priorities as “open borders.” And there is no evidence that they “want anybody,” including MS-13, to enter the United States freely.</p>

<p>While criticizing Mr. Trump’s immigration policies, the Democratic National Committee has committed to improving border security.</p>

<p>Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leaders, have rebutted the president’s charges. Additionally, their aides cited several examples of legislation that are supported by Democrats and would have provided border security funding.</p>

<p>“We care about protecting our country, but we don’t think we need to protect the border by putting children in cages,” Ms. Pelosi said. “We want to be smart and strong — not reckless, rash and ruthless in this case.”</p>

<p>Thirty Democrats in the House have sponsored a bipartisan immigration bill this year that gives the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers a pathway to citizenship. It also enhances technology used to monitor the border, and provides $110 million in grants annually for collaboration between local law enforcement and Border Patrol agents.</p>

<p>All 193 Democrats in the House and 23 moderate Republicans have signed a “discharge” petition to force a vote on that bill and other immigration proposals.</p>

<p>In the Senate, all but one Democrat voted for similar immigration legislation sponsored by Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware.</p>

<p>And all but three Democrats voted for yet another bipartisan proposal to provide a pathway to citizenship to Dreamers, authorize $25 billion to build barriers and hire personnel at the border over the next decade. It would also prohibit green-card holders from sponsoring adult children.</p>

<p>Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, repeated the assertion on Monday and argued that Democrats have “made it very clear that they don’t want to work with the president, that they don’t want to fix our immigration system” — referring to the political impasse over immigration reform.</p>

<p>The vast majority of Senate Democrats, and 14 Republicans, voted down a White House-backed Senate proposal that would enable the Department of Homeland Security to make more arrests and deportations, limit family-based immigration, and eliminate the diversity visa lottery. House Democrats have also suggested opposition to a new measure that will also limit legal immigration.</p>

<p>But rejecting these proposals does not amount to opposing any enforcement of immigration laws or allowing anyone, including criminals and gang members, to enter the country without restrictions.</p>

<p>Democrats also consistently supported border security measures before Mr. Trump took office.</p>

<p>In 2013, every single Democrat in the Senate voted for the so-called Gang of Eight immigration overhaul bill that would have provided about $40 billion for border enforcement, including deploying thousands more agents and building 700 miles of fencing. (The House never voted on the bill.)</p>

<p>And in 2006, 26 Senate Democrats voted to build 700 miles of walls and fences on the southwestern border. Mr. Schumer was among the Democrats who supported that proposal — a fact that even Mr. Trump has repeatedly acknowledged, as recently as last week.</p>

<h2 id="ifhedidntkillanyonewhyisitmurder">If He Didn’t Kill Anyone, Why Is It Murder?</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-26</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/us/california-felony-murder.html </p>

<p>Shawn Khalifa, center, with, from left, his sister, nephew and mother. Mr. Khalifa is serving 25 years to life, convicted under the felony murder rule.</p>

<p>SACRAMENTO — Late in the evening on Jan. 27, 2004, four teenagers broke into an elderly neighbor’s house in the Southern California town of Perris, looking for cash.</p>

<p>One of them, Shawn Khalifa, guarded the back door. Shawn, who had just turned 15, slipped into the kitchen and stole some chocolate candies. He briefly saw that the homeowner was seriously hurt, and he ran back outside.</p>

<p>No one accused Shawn of laying a hand on the victim, Hubert Love, 77, but a jury convicted the teenager of first-degree murder.</p>

<p>Mr. Khalifa, now 29 and serving a sentence of 25 years to life, is one of hundreds of people convicted in California under a legal doctrine known as the felony murder rule, which holds that anyone involved in certain kinds of serious felonies that result in death is as liable as the actual killer.</p>

<p>“I knew I didn’t kill anyone,” Mr. Khalifa said. “I felt and kind of knew that I was going to spend the rest of my life in prison. It didn’t seem like there was any room to be a human being again. My life was over.”</p>

<p>But the hard doctrine that sent Mr. Khalifa to prison may be softening. A bill moving through the California Legislature would change state law so that only someone who actually killed, intended to kill or acted as a major player with “reckless indifference to human life” could face murder charges.</p>

<p>The measure, already approved by the California Senate, cleared another important hurdle Tuesday when it won the blessing of the Assembly’s Public Safety Committee, despite strong opposition from law enforcement groups.</p>

<p>If the bill passes the State Assembly, California will join a growing number of states in abolishing or severely restricting felony murder. Over the decades, legislatures in Hawaii and Kentucky have abolished the rule, and, last fall, Massachusetts joined Michigan in ending it through the courts. The Pennsylvania Legislature is weighing a bill aimed at curtailing the practice.</p>

<p>“Many times in California, if you didn’t commit the murder, didn’t know the murder occurred, you could be charged and have the same sentence as the actual murderer,” said State Senator Nancy Skinner, who introduced the legislation in part because, she said, felony murder cases disproportionately affect women and young black and Latino men. “They had bad judgment, but they didn’t commit a murder — and when I understood this, I knew we had to fix that.”</p>

<p>Mack Wilson held a photo of his son Neko Wilson, who was charged under the felony murder rule, during the committee hearing in Sacramento.</p>

<p>The total number of people serving sentences for felony murder in California is unknown because the cases are not tracked separately from other murder convictions. But proponents of the bill estimate that it is between 400 and 800. In 2016, lawmakers rejected a bill that would have required prosecutors to collect data on felony murder prosecutions and report it to the state.</p>

<p>A survey answered by 1,000 prisoners convicted of murder found that the felony murder rule disproportionately affects women and young people. Of the women serving life sentences for murder in California, 72 percent were not the killers, according to the survey, which was conducted by Restore Justice, the Youth Justice Coalition and the Anti-Recidivism Coalition, California groups that support criminal justice reform.</p>

<p>The origins of the felony murder rule are murky. Generations of law students have been taught that it is a relic of British common law.</p>

<p>But Guyora Binder, a professor at the University at Buffalo School of Law and a leading expert on felony murder, said he had found otherwise. He traced modern felony murder doctrine to the 1820s, when state legislatures in the United States codified criminal offenses.</p>

<p>England abolished its version of felony murder in 1957, followed by India, Canada and other common law countries, and the United States remains the only country where the felony murder doctrine still exists. A Michigan Supreme Court ruling that did away with it in that state nearly four decades ago called it “a historic survivor for which there is no logical or practical basis for existence in modern law.”</p>

<p>The proposed California legislation would not undo felony murder entirely, but it would carve out the group of people who had very little involvement in the underlying crime and no intent to kill anyone, Mr. Binder said. That could make it a model for other states.</p>

<p>“This proposed bill is a very clever reform because it addresses the least popular and the least defensible aspects of the rule,” he said.</p>

<p>But opponents of the bill argue that people will be less likely to commit crimes if they know they will face maximum penalties if someone dies.</p>

<p>“The deterrence value is people are discouraged from participating in serious, dangerous felonies,” said Sean Hoffman, legislative director for the California District Attorneys Association, when he testified Tuesday in opposition to the bill.</p>

<p>Prosecutors and victims’ rights advocates say that the doctrine is justified because people who choose to participate in dangerous crimes do so knowing that an innocent person could die.</p>

<p>“The way the legislation is written, it gives everyone a path out, and only penalizes the actual shooter,” said Eric Siddall, a prosecutor and vice president of the Association of Deputy District Attorneys for Los Angeles County. Mr. Siddall said the legislation could make gang prosecutions more difficult.</p>

<p>Critics of the rule say felony murder can lead to absurd results. In some cases, accomplices have been charged with felony murder when the death actually occurred at the hands of the police or even the victim.</p>

<p>In one notorious 2012 case in Indiana, a group of young men who became known as the Elkhart Four, broke into a house searching for cash. The homeowner, who was napping upstairs, awoke, grabbed his gun and fatally shot one of the intruders. The remaining defendants were convicted of first-degree murder under the felony murder rule. The State Supreme Court later overturned three of the four convictions, but the felony murder rule remains.</p>

<p>California courts have criticized felony murder, while leaving the rule intact. In 1983, the California Supreme Court called felony murder a “barbaric” rule of “dubious origins” from a “bygone age,” but concluded that only the Legislature could change it.</p>

<p>A killing in California in 1995 drew national attention after a group of young men received life sentences. Five teenagers had gone to another high school student’s house near Malibu to buy marijuana. During an altercation, one of the five fatally stabbed another teen. Four of the five — Micah and Jason Holland, Brandon Hein and Anthony Miliotti — were prosecuted for felony murder.</p>

<p>“That case still haunts me,” said Robert Derham, a lawyer who represented Micah Holland on appeal. “It’s completely artificial. The punishment doesn’t fit the crime.”</p>

<p>Tuesday’s committee hearing focused on the human impact of the felony murder rule.</p>

<p>Jacque Wilson, a longtime San Francisco deputy public defender, recounted how in the summer of 2009 he got a call that his younger brother Neko had been accused of planning to rob a couple at a marijuana grow house in the Central Valley. During the robbery the couple, Gary and Sandra De Bartolo, were killed.</p>

<p>According to testimony at one defendant’s trial, Neko Wilson, 27 at the time, never went inside the house, but he was charged with first-degree murder.</p>

<p>“At that point, my world stopped,” Jacque Wilson said. “I had to explain it to my dad, how his son could be charged with murder without killing anyone.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson eventually took over as lead counsel to represent his brother, who has been in Fresno County Jail awaiting trial for almost a decade.</p>

<p>California has become a kind of national laboratory for prison reform since 2011, when the United States Supreme Court upheld a court-imposed cap on the state’s prison population, finding the prisons so overcrowded that inmates were dying. A series of legislative actions and ballot initiatives has reduced some felony crimes to misdemeanors, earmarked money for alternatives like drug and mental health treatment, and shifted more responsibility to the counties for supervising former prisoners.</p>

<p>The reforms have prompted a backlash from many law enforcement groups, who say the changes have led to the release of dangerous criminals, caused an increase in property crime and removed incentives for people to participate in drug court. Many of these groups are backing a proposed ballot measure aimed at rolling back the reforms.</p>

<p>One of the most contentious features of the felony murder bill is that it is retroactive, meaning that people currently serving life sentences for felony murder could petition the court to have their sentence reviewed.</p>

<p>The prosecutors association has said the bill goes too far, raising concerns that retroactivity would cause “potentially disastrous and costly problems.”</p>

<p>Felony murder convictions in California are not tracked or labeled, opening the gates for anyone with a murder conviction to ask for a re-examination of their case. For those who took plea deals, there may be little on the record to examine. A state fiscal analysis found that it could cost millions of dollars to process resentencing petitions, as well as to transport people to and from courts for resentencing.</p>

<p>Ms. Skinner and the bill’s supporters say the costs will be offset by savings from shorter sentences. The average cost to incarcerate an inmate in a California prison is about $80,000 a year.</p>

<p>Shawn Khalifa’s mother, Colleen Khalifa, is hopeful the bill could give her son a second chance. He was tried as an adult and has already served 14 years behind bars for his role as a lookout.</p>

<p>“It would give us our lives back,” she said. “Just the thought that there might be light at the end of the tunnel has given us hope. I already feel the anguish and stress being lifted.”</p>

<h2 id="supremecourtjusticeanthonykennedywillretire">Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy Will Retire</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Michael D. Shear</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-26</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/us/politics/anthony-kennedy-retire-supreme-court.html </p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced on Wednesday that he would retire this summer, setting in motion a furious fight over the future of the Supreme Court and giving President Trump the chance to put a conservative stamp on the American legal system for generations.</p>

<p>Justice Kennedy, 81, has been a critical swing vote on the sharply polarized court for nearly three decades as he embraced liberal views on gay rights, abortion and the death penalty but helped conservatives trim voting rights, block gun control measures and unleash campaign spending by corporations.</p>

<p>His replacement by a conservative justice — something Mr. Trump has vowed to his supporters — could imperil a variety of landmark Supreme Court precedents on social issues where Justice Kennedy frequently sided with his liberal colleagues, particularly on abortion.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have hoped for months that Justice Kennedy might retire, clearing a way for a new, more conservative jurist before Democrats had an opportunity to capture the Senate and block future Republican nominees. In contrast to his frequent criticisms of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., a generally reliable conservative, Mr. Trump has frequently heaped praise on Justice Kennedy and even has suggested that he might nominate one of his former clerks to the bench — subtle nudges the president hoped would make Justice Kennedy more comfortable with the idea of stepping down.</p>

<p>Justice Kennedy’s departure could leave Chief Justice Roberts, who was appointed by George W. Bush, as the decisive vote on a court whose other justices may soon include four committed liberals and four equally committed conservatives.</p>

<p>LATEST UPDATES Justice Kennedy’s Retirement</p>

<p>Get caught up with the latest from Times reporters and columnists.</p>

<p>Senator Susan Collins, whose vote on a Supreme Court nominee could prove decisive, said she would not vote for someone who showed “hostility” toward Roe v. Wade.</p>

<p>In a New York Times op-ed, the Senate minority leader argued that abortion rights and affordable health care will be endangered if the Senate does not resist the president’s nominee.</p>

<p>Here is a look at some front-runners for the nomination, and the full list of 25 potential nominees.</p>

<p>Do these updates help you stay informed? </p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback.</p>

<p>Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said he will retire this summer.</p>

<p>Justice Kennedy hand-delivered a short letter of resignation to Mr. Trump on Wednesday afternoon, shortly after a half-hour meeting at the White House, where the president called him a jurist with “tremendous vision and tremendous heart.”</p>

<p>“Please permit me by this letter to express my profound gratitude for having had the privilege to seek in each case how best to know, interpret and defend the Constitution and the laws that must always conform to its mandates and promises,” Justice Kennedy wrote to Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>The president called Justice Kennedy a “special guy” and a “star” during a Wednesday night rally in Fargo, N.D., and said that he would find a replacement with “intellect” who would last for several decades on the bench.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump promised to begin an immediate search for a replacement and to pick from a list of 25 conservative jurists he had previously identified as candidates for the court’s next vacancy. In comments to reporters, Mr. Trump said he would nominate “somebody who will be just as outstanding” as Justice Kennedy.</p>

<p>Potential nominees include Brett M. Kavanaugh, a federal appellate judge for the District of Columbia Circuit who clerked for Justice Kennedy at the Supreme Court. Another possibility is Judge Thomas M. Hardiman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, whom Mr. Trump seriously considered last year to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016. The president chose Judge Neil M. Gorsuch instead.</p>

<p>The Senate, which must confirm the president’s pick for the court, is under Republican control, which gives Mr. Trump the opportunity to win approval of his choice without any Democratic support. But the Senate’s makeup could change after congressional elections this fall, putting immense pressure on the president and his party to nominate and confirm a justice before November.</p>

<p>Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, called on senators to make sure the president’s nominee would be “considered fairly” without being subjected to personal or character attacks.</p>

<p>“We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall,” Mr. McConnell vowed in brief remarks on Wednesday.</p>

<p>But Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, demanded that the Senate wait to confirm Justice Kennedy’s replacement until after the midterm elections. Mr. Schumer noted that Republicans delayed consideration of President Barack Obama’s court nominee in 2016, Judge Merrick B. Garland, citing the presidential election that year.</p>

<p>The Republicans prevented even a hearing for Mr. Obama’s nominee, which effectively handed Mr. Trump the chance to fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Scalia. The move infuriated Democrats, who accused Republicans of stealing Mr. Obama’s right to fill a seat on the court.</p>

<p>Mr. Schumer said senators should not “consider a Supreme Court justice in an election year,” saying that “anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy.”</p>

<p>“People are just months away from determining the senators who should vote to confirm or reject the president’s nominee,” Mr. Schumer said on the floor of the Senate, “and their voices deserve to be heard now, as Senator McConnell thought that they deserved to be heard then.”</p>

<p>Justice Kennedy, a Californian and graduate of Harvard Law School, was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. But he was never a reliable conservative and evolved into one of the court’s most unpredictable jurists.</p>

<p>He wrote some of the country’s most important gay rights decisions and helped to drastically shift the United States’ legal treatment of gays, lesbians and transgender people. In 2015, he wrote the court’s opinion that established the right for gay people to marry each other.</p>

<p>With Kennedy’s Retirement, the Supreme Court Loses Its Center</p>

<p>The swing vote in many decisions, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy shifted toward more conservative opinions in the final months of his 30-year justice tenure.</p>

<p>June 27, 2018</p>

<p>“Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions,” Justice Kennedy wrote of gay Americans. “They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.”</p>

<p>Justice Kennedy has also served as the linchpin of the judicial defense of abortion rights, frequently siding with the court’s liberals in turning back conservative challenges to Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that established a constitutional right to abortion.</p>

<p>But Justice Kennedy has also been a decisive vote for rulings that cemented conservative principles in some of the most contentious issues in American political life.</p>

<p>He wrote the opinion in Citizens United, which gave corporations the right to make unlimited campaign contributions. He joined the court’s conservatives in 2008 in declaring that the Constitution protects a person’s right to keep a loaded gun at home for self-defense.</p>

<p>After the 2000 election, Justice Kennedy also joined the majority in Bush v. Gore, handing the presidency to Mr. Bush and drawing the ire of Democrats who believed the election was stolen from Vice President Al Gore.</p>

<p>In leaving this year, Justice Kennedy gives Mr. Trump and the Republican Party the opportunity to undermine the permanence of the liberal cases that he shaped. His retirement will have far more effect than Mr. Trump’s selection of Justice Gorsuch, a conservative who replaced another conservative, Justice Scalia.</p>

<p>During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump promised voters that he would choose a Supreme Court nominee — should he get the opportunity — from a list of mostly conservative judges that he made public.</p>

<p>He first offered 11 names, then added 10 more, compiled by Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump’s longtime election lawyer and now the White House counsel, with input from the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, two conservative legal organizations. Since last year, the list — which is published at whitehouse.gov — has grown to 25 names.</p>

<p>“We have a very excellent list of great, talented, highly educated, highly intelligent — hopefully, tremendous — people. I think the list is very outstanding,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday. “So it will be somebody from that list.”</p>

<p>In addition to Judge Kavanaugh and Judge Hardiman, Mr. Trump is expected to seriously consider William H. Pryor Jr. and Amul R. Thapar, both appeals courts judges. Mr. Trump interviewed Judges Hardiman, Pryor and Thapar in 2017 before picking Judge Gorsuch.</p>

<p>The White House is likely to conduct a similar process this year, with Mr. Trump meeting personally with several candidates and discussing the issue with advisers inside and outside the administration.</p>

<p>Because Mr. Trump is unpredictable, it is possible that he might pick someone like Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, a conservative lawmaker who appears on the president’s list of 25 possible nominees. Mr. Trump could also, despite his pledge, veer from the list and pick someone else.</p>

<p>In his remarks to reporters shortly after meeting with Justice Kennedy, the president appeared to appreciate the gravity of the choice before him.</p>

<p>“In our country, the selection of a justice of the United States Supreme Court is considered, I think we can all say, one of the most important events — one of the most important things for our country,” he said. “I mean, you see the decisions that just came down, how big they are, how vital they are.”</p>

<p>“Some people think,” the president added, “outside of, obviously, war and peace, it’s the most important thing that you could have.”</p>

<h2 id="howthesupremecourtreplacedoneinjusticewithanother">How the Supreme Court Replaced One Injustice With Another</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Karen Korematsu</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-26</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/opinion/supreme-court-travel-ban-korematsu-japanese-internment.html </p>

<p>Japanese-Americans arriving at the Manzanar internment camp — one of 10 such camps established during World War II — in Owens Valley, Calif., in 1942.</p>

<p>During World War II, about 120,000 men, women and children of Japanese descent, including almost 40,000 foreign nationals living on the West Coast, were removed from their homes, forced to forfeit their possessions and then incarcerated on the basis of military orders authorized by the president.</p>

<p>My father, Fred, and others who defied the military orders were criminally charged and imprisoned. Defending themselves against the charges, my father, along with Gordon Hirabayashi and Minoru Yasui, all United States citizens, challenged the constitutionality of the orders. In a series of decisions, the Supreme Court upheld his and the others’ convictions in 1943 and 1944. In those now infamous decisions, which constitutional scholars on both sides of the political aisle have criticized, the Supreme Court deferred to the government’s assertions that its racially discriminatory policies were justified by military necessity. But history proved otherwise.</p>

<p>In extraordinary legal proceedings that vacated my father’s conviction nearly 40 years later in 1983, evidence of government misconduct showed that the “military necessity” on which the court predicated its decision was apparently nothing more than a smoke screen. The real reason for the government’s deplorable treatment of Japanese Americans was not acts of espionage but rather a baseless perception of disloyalty grounded in racial stereotypes. His victory in a Federal District Court meant that the Supreme Court would not hear his case, leaving the 1944 decision intact, though almost universally discredited.</p>

<p>When President Trump used questionable evidence to issue executive orders last year banning immigration from predominantly Muslim countries, I heard the same kind of stereotypes that targeted the Japanese-Americans in World War II being used against Muslims. So I, along with the children of Mr. Hirabayashi and Mr. Yasui, asked the Supreme Court to reject President Trump’s orders. We pointed to our fathers’ cases as an urgent warning against executive power run amok.</p>

<p>And we implored the court to repudiate its decisions in those cases while affirming their greater legacy: Blind deference to the executive branch, even in areas in which the president must wield wide discretion, is incompatible with the protection of fundamental freedoms. Meaningful judicial review is an essential element of a healthy democracy.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Supreme Court got it partly right. After nearly 75 years, the court officially overruled Korematsu v. United States. In the majority decision, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., citing language used in a dissent to the 1944 ruling, wrote that the court was taking “the opportunity to make express what is already obvious: Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has been overruled in the court of history, and — to be clear — ‘has no place in law under the Constitution.’”</p>

<p>But the court’s repudiation of the Korematsu decision tells only half the story. Although it correctly rejected the abhorrent race-based relocation and incarceration of Japanese Americans, it failed to recognize — and reject — the rationale that led to that infamous decision. In fact, the Supreme Court indicated that the reason it addressed Korematsu was because the dissenting justices noted the “stark parallels between the reasoning of” the two cases.</p>

<p>The court majority disagreed with the dissenters, claiming that Mr. Trump’s executive order had “nothing to do with” Korematsu and finding it “wholly inapt to liken that morally repugnant order to a facially neutral policy denying certain foreign nationals the privilege of admission.”</p>

<p>Pointing to the government’s stated purpose of “preventing entry of nationals who cannot be adequately vetted and inducing other nations to improve their practices,” the court saw “persuasive evidence that the entry suspension has a legitimate grounding in national security concerns, quite apart from any religious hostility.”</p>

<p>In rejecting a racist decision, then, the Supreme Court seemed to repeat the same bad logic of the 1940s decision by rubber stamping the Trump administration’s bald assertions that the “immigration travel ban” is justified by national security.</p>

<p>As Justice Sonia Sotomayor explained in her dissent, “This formal repudiation of a shameful precedent is laudable and long overdue. But it does not make the majority’s decision here acceptable or right. By blindly accepting the government’s misguided invitation to sanction a discriminatory policy motivated by animosity toward a disfavored group, all in the name of a superficial claim of national security, the court redeploys the same dangerous logic underlying Korematsu and merely replaces one ‘gravely wrong’ decision with another.”</p>

<p>My father spent his life fighting for justice and educating people about the inhumanity of the Japanese-American incarceration, so that we would learn from our mistakes. Although he would be somewhat glad his case was finally overruled, he would be upset that it was cited while upholding discrimination against another marginalized group. The court’s decision replaced one injustice with another nearly 75 years later.</p>

<p>My father would still say, “Stand up for what is right.”</p>

<h2 id="alexandriaocasiocortezemergesasapoliticalstar">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Emerges as a Political Star</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-26</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/nyregion/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-bio-profile.html </p>

<p>At the Parkchester apartments in the Bronx, neighbors heard the news from a maintenance worker: The woman down the hall had just won a primary and was probably headed for Congress. At a popular restaurant in Union Square in Manhattan, workers struggled to comprehend that the young politician whose face was all over TV really was the same woman who had tended bar until a few months ago.</p>

<p>And on the streets of Midtown Manhattan Wednesday morning, the candidate herself was trying to make sense of it all. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stood outside Rockefeller Center after appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” juggling phone calls and live TV interviews and the well-wishes of doormen and office workers on their coffee breaks.</p>

<p>“I’m used to people kind of knowing me in the community,” said Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 28. But to have a stream of random people walk up and ask to take a selfie with her? “Insane.”</p>

<p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, whose résumé up to now included waitress, children’s-book publisher, community activist, member of the Democratic Socialists of America and former Bernie Sanders campaign organizer, was now something else: an instant political rock star. She stunned the Democratic establishment by beating one of the senior leaders in the House, Joseph Crowley, in a near-landslide in Tuesday’s primary.</p>

<p>She is expected to have little difficulty defeating the Republican candidate, Anthony Pappas, in a predominantly Democratic district that takes in working-class, immigrant-heavy swaths of the Bronx and Queens in November.</p>

<p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to be adjusting to the intensity with the aplomb of a natural retail politician, graciously granting every request for a picture while staying cheerfully on a progressive message that has energized the Democrats’ left wing. “Thank you!” she said, over and over, eyes wide, smile wider, her hand flying to her chest. “Thank you so much.”</p>

<p>“When you won, I was bawling,” said Tahia Islam, a woman in her early 20s whose family lives in Queens. Ms. Islam was passing through the plaza on a break from her marketing job. “I had my whole family vote for you.”</p>

<p>If Ms. Ocasio-Cortez defeats her Republican opponent in November, she, at 28, would be the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, of course, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s rise has been a little less sudden. “For two years,” she said, “all I have been thinking about is 8:59 on June 26,” when the polls closed on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>But it goes back many years before that. As a teenager, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez never hesitated to speak her mind during political conversations around the dinner table.</p>

<p>“There was nobody who could shut her up,” said her mother, Blanca Ocasio-Cortez. “I saw the political tendencies since she was very, very young.”</p>

<p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s mother was born in Puerto Rico. Her late father, Sergio Ocasio, an architect, was born in the Bronx. The family lived in Parkchester, a planned community of mid-rise buildings, in the same apartment where Ms. Ocasio-Cortez now lives, until Alexandria was about 5, when they moved an hour north to a modest two-bedroom house on a quiet street in Yorktown Heights, a suburb in Westchester County, in search of better schools.</p>

<p>At Yorktown High School, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was a serious science student and won second place in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair in 2007. She presented her project, on the anti-aging effect of antioxidants in roundworms, to the town board of education, her science teacher Michael Blueglass said.</p>

<p>“One of the administrators wasn’t there at the beginning and came in after she started, and he said to the superintendent, ‘What company is she from?’” Mr. Blueglass recalled. “The superintendent said, ‘She’s a 17-year-old senior in our high school.’ She presented herself, verbally, visually, everything, as if she was a 30-year-old professional presenter businesswoman even though she was 17 years old.”</p>

<p>Mr. Blueglass said that even as a teenager, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez looked at science research through a political lens. “She was interested in research to help people in all areas, including developing nations, not just for the people with money.”</p>

<p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez went off to Boston University. Her father died early in her sophomore year. She took only a week off from school, and afterward, threw herself into her studies. “She jumped from having good grades to being on the dean’s list,” her mother said.</p>

<p>She majored in economics and international relations, impressing the professor who taught an antitrust economics class, Marc Rysman, with “great analytic abilities.”</p>

<p>She also dabbled in establishment politics during college, working for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, on immigration, but soon turned her attention to the grass-roots work that would come to define her candidacy.</p>

<p>Returning to the Bronx after graduation, she began advocating improved childhood education and literacy, starting a children’s book publishing company that sought to portray her home borough in a positive light.</p>

<p>She returned to national politics when she worked as an organizer for the Sanders campaign. She has credited her decision to seek office with her experience protesting at the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation in 2016 against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Around that time, she was contacted by Brand New Congress, a newly formed progressive organization that asked her to run.</p>

<p>She has also worked for years teaching summer courses in community leadership to high school students for the National Hispanic Institute.</p>

<p>She continued working until February behind the bar at Flats Fix, a taco restaurant in Union Square (where a photo of her mixing a drink still adorns their home page), heading off to political meetings and fund-raising house parties after her shift.</p>

<p>“I spent the entire first part of this campaign just going to people’s living rooms and having them invite their neighbors, and just doing little coffee parties for like six or seven months,” she said. “And that’s how we really started this campaign.”</p>

<p>Her campaign evolved into something of a digital and door-to-door crusade. She and her campaign’s digital staff used Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to turn out new voters and push a progressive message that included calls for tuition-free public colleges, Medicare for All, and the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.</p>

<p>“The scope of the digital effort for a campaign like this was massive,” said Jake DeGroot, who helped to manage Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s digital efforts. About 30 volunteers used a private WhatsApp group to coordinate social media strategy, according to Ananya Kumar-Banerjee, another volunteer with the campaign.</p>

<p>On Facebook, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s team spent months refining and testing various get-out-the-vote messages and campaign announcements in English and Spanish. Since early May, when Facebook began archiving political ads in a public database, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign purchased about 180 ads for her official Facebook and Instagram pages. Mr. Crowley’s campaign bought 110 Facebook and Instagram ads during the same time period, all in English.</p>

<p>Ms. Ocasio-Cortez also kept with her ground game, saying it was important to “commit to grass roots, on-the-ground organizing, to knocking on those doors and making those numbers and phone calls.”</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Primary Day, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez still did not know where she was going to have her “watch party” for the election results. She finally settled on a billiard hall in the Bronx.</p>

<p>In the car there, she put her phone away and did not check the returns. “Everybody in the car we were in was so nervous,” she said. “We were just like, ‘Don’t check it, don’t check.’”</p>

<p>As the car pulled up, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez saw through a window a headline on a screen inside that put her in the lead.</p>

<p>“So I just started running,” she said. “I literally ran and I busted through the doors.”</p>

<h2 id="kennedyisgonenowvote">Kennedy Is Gone. Now Vote.</h2>

<p>Judge Neil Gorsuch and Justice Anthony Kennedy during the swearing-in ceremony of Judge Gorsuch to the Supreme Court on April 10, 2017.</p>

<p>If the last few days hadn’t been dispiriting enough for those who believed the Supreme Court could still stand for reproductive freedom, equal rights for all Americans, a check on presidential power, a more humane criminal justice system and so much more, Wednesday afternoon brought the coup de grâce.</p>

<p>Everyone knew it was coming sooner than later, but Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement, which he announced in a letter released hours after the court had issued its final rulings of the term, is still crushing. It sends a stark message to the tens of millions of Americans who have long turned to the court for the vindication of many of their most cherished rights and protections: Look somewhere else.</p>

<p>That place is the ballot box. So show up and vote. In the absence of a Supreme Court majority that will reliably protect human dignity, universal equality and women’s right to control their own bodies, it is up to Americans who cherish these values to elect politicians at every level of government who share them.</p>

<p>Justice Kennedy, who was nominated to the court by President Ronald Reagan and confirmed in 1988, defended these values, however imperfectly. He was the last in a line of Republican-appointed justices who moderated some of the reactionary tendencies on the court, which has now had a majority of Republican appointees for nearly half a century. All of those justices were confirmed in the days before ultraconservative activists hijacked the nomination process and ensured that only faithful right-wing ideologues would get a nod. With Justice Kennedy’s departure, the court is very likely to lock in an unmoderated, hard-right majority for the rest of most of our lives.</p>

<p>It is a dark moment in the history of the court and the nation, and it’s about to get a lot darker. Once President Trump names his second pick and the Senate confirms that person, you can forget about new or enhanced protections for gays and lesbians, or saving the last shreds of affirmative action at public universities. Longstanding precedents are now at extreme risk. Foremost among these is a woman’s right to choose to have an abortion under Roe v. Wade, which was preserved solely on the strength of Justice Kennedy’s vote.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, count on more rulings that, like Monday’s decision upholding racial gerrymandering in Texas, give states the green light to cut back on voting rights, promote the rights of corporations over individuals, further erode the wall between church and state and look the other way when states cut corners and evade constitutional requirements in order to execute their citizens.</p>

<p>Even this scenario, of course, assumes the continued longevity of Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who provide an essential counterweight to the court’s conservative wing, but who are 79 and 85, respectively, and have endured their share of health problems. If either leaves in the next few years and is replaced by President Trump, the court will easily become the most conservative in American history.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is designed as a countermajoritarian institution, and operates as a crucial check in a democracy based on majority rule. Still it is hard to swallow that this court is about to solidify a deeply conservative majority, despite the fact that in six of the last seven presidential elections, more Americans have voted for a Democrat than for a Republican.</p>

<p>Under the arrangement that sustained the legitimacy of the court for generations, until last year, the replacement of a swing justice would trigger a battle in the Senate, as the minority party wielded the threat of a filibuster to head off any ideologically extreme nominee. That won’t be happening this time. Senate Republicans killed the filibuster for Supreme Court justices last spring on their way to installing Neil Gorsuch, the ideologue for whom they had already stolen a seat that rightly should have been filled by President Barack Obama, and who could sit on the court for 40 years.</p>

<p>Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who put up that blockade despite the damage it inflicted on two branches of government, is celebrating now. He knows he has an open road to confirming whomever he and the Federalist Society want on the bench. Of course, it would take only a couple of Republican senators — say, Bob Corker and Jeff Flake, both of whom are retiring and have been very critical of Mr. Trump, or Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who have supported abortion rights — to force the president to pick someone who at least approximates a moderate.</p>

<p>That person should be at least partly in the mold of Justice Kennedy, who, while far from an ideal justice — his opinions could be vague and confusing, his jurisprudential commitments often unpredictable — emphasized the basic principles of equality and dignity to a degree not in evidence among the court’s four other conservatives.</p>

<p>Consider a few of Justice Kennedy’s most significant majority opinions and votes: He protected reproductive rights and saved Roe v. Wade from being effectively overturned. He led the way in recognizing the equality and dignity of gays and lesbians and, in 2015, granting same-sex couples the constitutional right to marry. He preserved the use of affirmative-action policies at public universities. He spoke out forcefully on the need to fix the nation’s broken criminal justice system, voting to strike down excessive sentences for juveniles and the intellectually disabled and to force states to shrink their overcrowded prisons. He gave prisoners held at the Guantánamo Bay detention center the right to habeas corpus, rejecting the executive branch’s attempt to create a legal black hole beyond the reach of any court.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he wrote the majority opinion in one of the most damaging decisions in the court’s modern history, Citizens United, which opened the floodgates to unlimited spending in political races by corporations and labor unions. And he provided the key fifth vote to the court’s 2013 gutting of the Voting Rights Act, which has allowed states across the country to make it harder for people, especially minorities, to vote. In the last few weeks alone, he voted to protect a Christian baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple, he voted to uphold President Trump’s travel ban and he declined to rein in partisan gerrymandering, one of the most corrosive and anti-democratic practices in modern America.</p>

<p>Still, Justice Kennedy played a critical tempering role on a court that has become, like the nation as a whole, increasingly entrenched along political lines. Even with him on the bench, the most liberal conservative voted to the right of the most conservative liberal. Without him, and thanks to Mr. McConnell’s nakedly cynical ploy, any remaining sense that the court can exist apart from partisan politics is gone.</p>

<p>For those who face the future in fear after Wednesday, there are no easy answers — but there is a clear duty. Do not for a moment underestimate the importance of getting out and voting in November. Four years ago, only 36 percent of Americans cast ballots in the midterm elections. Had more people showed up, the Senate may well have remained in Democratic control, Mitch McConnell would not be the majority leader and Judge Merrick Garland would now be Justice Garland. In the days and months ahead, remember this.</p>

<h2 id="anthonykennedysexitmayechoforgenerations">Anthony Kennedy’s Exit May Echo for Generations</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Charlie Savage</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-legacy.html </p>

<p>By replacing the retiring Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, right, President Trump has a chance to cement his legacy by adding another solidly conservative justice to the Supreme Court alongside his first choice, Neil M. Gorsuch, center.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — President Trump’s time in office has been tumultuous, his term dogged by the special counsel investigation, his major legislative achievements few and his political prospects clouded by the chances of a Democratic Party midterm wave.</p>

<p>But no matter what else happens in the Trump presidency, the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, the Supreme Court’s swing voter, set up Mr. Trump to cement a lasting legacy. Given a second Supreme Court vacancy to fill, he appears likely to go down in American history as an unusually influential president.</p>

<p>As the first Republican president to get his judicial nominees confirmed by a simple majority vote, thanks to the abolition of the Senate filibuster rule, Mr. Trump has already broken records in appointing young and highly conservative appellate judges. Now, Mr. Trump can create a new majority bloc on the Supreme Court — one that is far more consistently conservative, and one that can impose its influence over American life long after his presidency ends on issues as diverse as the environment and labor or abortion and civil rights.</p>

<p>If Mr. Trump secures that prospect, he will fulfill the deal that he struck during the 2016 campaign with traditional and movement conservatives who were skeptical of his politics and hesitant about supporting his candidacy. They feared he would pick an idiosyncratic nominee, like a celebrity lawyer he saw on television, rather than an authentic conservative.</p>

<p>But Mr. Trump shored up Republican turnout in the election by promising to select Supreme Court nominations from a list of conservative judges. It was shaped by his top legal adviser, Donald F. McGahn II, now the White House counsel, who worked with advisers like Leonard Leo, the executive vice president of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal movement network. Court-focused voters helped deliver Mr. Trump’s narrow victory over Hillary Clinton, exit polls showed.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump picked from his list to fulfill his first vacancy last year, choosing Neil M. Gorsuch to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, a staunch conservative. Since then, debates among conservatives about his unruly presidency have been characterized by a joking shorthand for what traditional Republicans got in return: “But Gorsuch.” In November, the White House quietly issued a revised version of the list in case another vacancy arose.</p>

<p>It is filled with young and conservative appeals court judges — including runners-up from the last vacancy’s short list, like Thomas M. Hardiman, Raymond Kethledge, William H. Pryor Jr. and Amul Thapar; Brett Kavanaugh, an appeals court judge Mr. Trump added to his options in November; and several women, including Amy Coney Barrett and Joan L. Larsen, both newly minted appeals court judges appointed by Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>Conservative legal advocates fervently hope Mr. Trump sticks with his vow to pick one of those nominees or someone similar to complete a historic remaking of the judiciary.</p>

<p>“This is a second opportunity for President Trump to fulfill what is, to me, his most important campaign promise — that he would put justices on the court who would be faithful to the Constitution, fair, and impartial,” said Carrie Severino of the Judicial Crisis Network, which advocates on behalf of confirming conservative judges.</p>

<p>“Justice Gorsuch was an example of that,” she added. “And this is why the American people gave him the presidency in the first place, if you look at the data.”</p>

<p>Liberal legal advocates see the stakes as similarly huge, but view Mr. Trump’s good fortune in a decidedly more negative light. Nan Aron, the president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, said that Justice Gorsuch’s record on the court makes clear that putting another justice in his mold into Justice Kennedy’s seat represents a drastic threat.</p>

<p>“The danger is that the Supreme Court, at the behest of this president, will favor the wealthy and powerful and extremist groups at the expense of everyone else — not just for President Trump’s term, but for decades to come,” she said.</p>

<p>The prospects for the nominee’s confirmation will most likely come down to how a handful of moderate senators will vote. Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both Republicans who support abortion rights, are considered key votes in a narrowly divided Senate, as are Senators Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, all Democrats up for re-election in states that Mr. Trump won.</p>

<p>While conservatives expressed quiet confidence, liberals vowed to fight. On top of perennial issues like whether abortion will remain legal and available, several took note of other issues at play, including the Affordable Care Act and the Trump administration’s recent indication that it will try to use the courts to dismantle the law’s popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions.</p>

<p>“There is tremendous energy, not limited to the progressive community, over this,” said Marge Baker, the executive vice president of the liberal People for the American Way. “People get that this is about undoing precedent and advancing the interests of corporations and the wealthy and privileged, not all of us as Americans.”</p>

<p>“There is going to be a huge fight over this,” she warned. “We cannot let Trump have this court for generations to come.”</p>

<p>Adding to the court a pick from Mr. Trump’s list creates the “prospect of a conservative majority over a long period of time,” even if Mr. Trump loses to a Democrat in 2020 who could restock the court’s liberal minority, said Edward Whelan, a conservative legal commentator and the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center.</p>

<p>But Mr. Whelan said he was optimistic that the fight over the new vacancy would help Republicans maintain control of the Senate in the midterm elections by keeping the courts as a primary topic of political conversation in the coming months. Securing the Republican Senate majority could allow Mr. Trump to create an even more enduring achievement if a liberal justice’s seat opened, perhaps for health reasons, in the second half of his term, Mr. Whelan said. The president could then add another right-wing justice to the court.</p>

<p>“The conservative debate between ‘Never Trumpers’ and Trump supporters will be going on for a long time and will depend on a lot of things that happen over the next two years,” Mr. Whelan said. “But I think we see that judicial nominations unite conservatives in a way that so many other issues don’t.”</p>

<h2 id="americaisguiltyofneglectingkidsourown">America Is Guilty of Neglecting Kids: Our Own</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Nicholas Kristof</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-26</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/opinion/nikki-haley-united-states-extreme-poverty.html </p>

<p>A family in Flint, Mich. Lead in the public water system endangered the health of city residents, particularly children.</p>

<p>It’s not just the kids at the border.</p>

<p>America systematically shortchanges tens of millions of children, including homegrown kids. The upshot is that American kids are more likely to be poor, to drop out of high school and even to die young than in other advanced countries.</p>

<p>We tear apart homegrown families, too, through mass incarceration, excessive juvenile detention and overuse of foster care. One black child in 10 spends time in foster care — and 61,000 foster kids have simply gone missing since 2000.</p>

<p>Like immigration, the mistreatment of children is an old problem that President Trump is exacerbating. Here’s a rule of thumb in America for any shortage of resources or conflict over priorities: Kids get screwed.</p>

<p>“A shockingly high number of children in the U.S. live in poverty,” the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, declared in a scathing report. Almost one-fifth of American children live in poverty, he noted, and they account for more than one-fifth of homeless people.</p>

<p>Alston told me that “there’s a very direct link” between the mistreatment of immigrant children at the border and the indifference toward low-income children all across the country. The core reason, he suggested, is a lack of compassion.</p>

<p>Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, protested the U.N. report, saying, “It is patently ridiculous for the United Nations to examine poverty in America.”</p>

<p>Really, Ambassador Haley?</p>

<p>Yes, it’s weird that a U.N. official tasked with poverty investigates the most powerful country in the world — and finds that kids here have worms. I’m glad that the U.N. speaks up not only for impoverished children in Congo, but also for those in, say, South Carolina (where a newborn black child has a shorter life expectancy than a child born in China).</p>

<p>Two researchers, Kathryn Edin and Luke Shaefer, have found that some three million American children live in “extreme poverty,” with a cash income of less than $2 per person per day, the global metric for extreme poverty.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that poverty in America is comparable to that in poor countries. American kids may go to bed hungry, but very few are stunted from malnutrition, compared with 38 percent of children in India.</p>

<p>The paradox is that the United States historically was a safe and nurturing place for children. America helped lead the world in mass education, and in 1960 children here died at lower rates than in most other advanced countries.</p>

<p>Since about 1970, however, as other countries provided universal health care and built up social safety nets, American kids have been dying at higher rates. A child is 57 percent more likely to die by the age of 19 in the U.S. than in our peer countries, according to a study published this year in Health Affairs.</p>

<p>Half a million American kids still suffer from lead poisoning each year. And Dr. Peter Hotez, a tropical disease specialist at Baylor’s College of Medicine, warns that here in the United States, “Millions of children living in poverty may be affected by toxocariasis, a parasitic roundworm infection.”</p>

<p>Why do we stiff kids? Why do we provide universal health care for senior citizens (which is expensive) but not for children (which would be cheap)? The simple answer: Kids don’t vote. They depend on us, and we fail them.</p>

<p>If we can broaden the current outrage to the plight of all children in America, we could transform lives.</p>

<p>In Arkansas, I once dropped in on the home of a struggling 13-year-old boy. It was a filthy flophouse for drug users in a gang-ridden area. There were no books in the house, and no food; the only reason the power wasn’t cut off for nonpayment was the pit bull kept to scare off the utility crew.</p>

<p>These are difficult problems but not hopeless ones, and we know what works. Early childhood programs in particular make a huge difference: parent coaching, high-quality prekindergarten, lead poisoning interventions, social worker visits, and mentoring.</p>

<p>World Bank President Jim Yong Kim cites a study indicating that if the U.S. invested in effective early childhood programs, the lifelong benefits would be so transformative that American inequality could be reduced to Canadian levels.</p>

<p>We already have a model: When Tony Blair was the British prime minister he undertook a major campaign against child poverty and cut it nearly in half.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Trump is moving in the opposite direction, cutting benefit programs in ways that will hurt poor kids. Trump’s tax cuts add to the deficit — meaning that we are partying and sticking children with the bill.</p>

<p>A national, bipartisan outcry forced Trump to back down from tearing immigrant children from their parents’ arms at the border; that was a shared outpouring of compassion that represented our country’s best. Now we need a similar outcry on behalf of all of America’s children.</p>

<h2 id="alloveruslocalofficialscanceldealstodetainimmigrants">All Over U.S., Local Officials Cancel Deals to Detain Immigrants</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Simon Romero</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/us/migrant-shelters-ice-contracts-counties.html </p>

<p>A protest against family separations in El Paso this week. Local governments around the United States are ending lucrative contracts with federal immigration entities as ire builds over the Trump administration’s immigration policies.</p>

<p>EL PASO — In Texas, officials near Austin terminated a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to detain dozens of migrant mothers who had been arrested and separated from their children. In California, Sacramento County ended a multimillion-dollar deal with ICE to keep immigrants jailed while awaiting hearings.</p>

<p>The City Council of Springfield in western Oregon voted unanimously to end yet another contract with ICE for housing immigrants in the municipal jail. And in Alexandria, Virginia, authorities put an end to a deal allowing ICE to house immigrant children in a juvenile detention center.</p>

<p>Local governments around the United States are starting to sever lucrative ties with federal immigration entities amid growing discomfort with the Trump administration’s immigration policies. Fueled largely by alarm over the separation of migrant children from their parents, the cancellations suggest an attempt to disengage from federal policies seen as harmful to immigrant families — even when those policies could be pouring millions of dollars into local government budgets.</p>

<p>“It just felt inherently unjust for Sacramento to make money from dealing with ICE,” said Phil Serna, a Sacramento County supervisor who joined two colleagues in canceling the contract. “For me, it came down to an administration that is extremely hostile to immigrants. I didn’t feel we should be part of that.”</p>

<p>The local debates over what to do with ICE facilities come at a time when federal immigration policies are disrupting local politics. Insurgent Democratic candidates on the left who are winning primaries, such as Deb Haaland in New Mexico and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York, have made defunding or abolishing ICE a central feature of their campaign platforms.</p>

<p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who won the Democratic primary in New York’s 14th Congressional District, made abolishing ICE a central feature of her campaign.</p>

<p>But even before the uproar this month over separations of migrant families, claims of overreach and inhumane treatment by ICE agents, including targeting immigrants outside churches, schools and courthouses, were flaring tempers in communities around the country.</p>

<p>“Dealing with ICE became distracting from the day-to-day operations of running our county,” said Terry Cook, a commissioner in Williamson County in Texas, a relatively conservative part of the Austin metropolitan area where Dell Computer employs thousands of people.</p>

<p>Ms. Cook was among the commissioners who voted 4 to 1 this week to end the county’s contract with ICE by 2019, an agreement under which nearly 40 mothers separated from their children have been held in the T. Don Hutto Residential Center. The facility is managed by CoreCivic, a private prison operator, through an intergovernment agreement with the county.</p>

<p>“The federal government made their bed with its policies, so let them sleep in it,” said Ms. Cook, emphasizing that efforts to end the contract had started to gain momentum about four months ago, well before the migrant family separations made national headlines. “We did not need to be in the middle of this.”</p>

<p>In another sign of public concern over immigration policies, even some private companies and nonprofits are balking at potentially lucrative deals with federal immigration agencies. Two Texas entities, APTIM and BCFS, declined this month to participate in a proposed no-bid contract worth as much as $1 billion to expand a tent camp for migrant children, according to a report by Texas Monthly.</p>

<p>In some parts of the country, the discussions over ICE contracts seem to be widening political fissures.</p>

<p>Residents of Evanston, a town of 12,000 in southwest Wyoming, have been fiercely debating for weeks a proposal by the private prison operator Management Training Corporation to build an ICE detention center near the community. The project could create as many as 150 jobs in a region with a relatively weak economy.</p>

<p>Some in Evanston compare the plan to the concentration camps built in Wyoming for Japanese-Americans during World War II. But accusations of racism and xenophobia leveled against supporters of the project have produced angry rebuttals. Jim Hissong, the director of family services for Uinta County, which encompasses Evanston, said opponents of the facility were “using the same kind of divisive rhetoric that Trump uses.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like being called immoral and a racist,” said Mr. Hissong, who described himself as a “Reagan Republican” who dislikes the Trump administration. “I just believe that the federal government has an obligation to uphold immigration laws and this would be an economic boon for us.”</p>

<p>Indeed, some local governments are opting to remain in or even expand contracts with federal authorities for holding immigrants. Officials in Yolo County in Northern California voted this week to accept more than $2 million in additional federal money from the Office of Refugee Resettlement for holding immigrant children at a detention facility, overriding criticism.</p>

<p>“We need to approach each facility on a case-by-case basis to do what’s right for the young people involved,” said David Lichtenhan, vice chairman of the Yolo Interfaith Immigration Network, which urged the county to go forward with the contract. “The kids are vulnerable and could end up being moved into a district that’s less favorable to immigrants than ours. That’s an outcome we sought to avoid.”</p>

<p>But local governments are clearly reading the political winds, amid widespread public protests around the country over the treatment of migrant families. Some of those expressing the most concern are cities that already are home to large immigrant populations.</p>

<p>In Houston, the city’s leadership is urging Southwest Key, the Texas organization that has already won nearly $1 billion in federal contracts for migrant facilities since 2015, to abandon plans to put immigrant children in a former warehouse near the city’s downtown.</p>

<p>“I do not want to be an enabler in this process,” said Mayor Sylvester Turner, adding that he had also made a personal appeal to its owner, David Denenburg, to find another use for the building. “There comes a time when we must draw the line, and for me the line is with our children.”</p>

<h2 id="helsinkisummitmeetingissetfortrumpandputin">Helsinki Summit Meeting Is Set for Trump and Putin</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Andrew E. Kramer</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/world/europe/trump-putin-helsinki-meeting.html </p>

<p>President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin met on the sidelines of a Group of 20 meeting in Germany in 2017.</p>

<p>MOSCOW — President Trump plans to meet President Vladimir V. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on July 16 for one-on-one talks, the White House said on Thursday, a politically delicate meeting that will take place while the special counsel continues to investigate the Trump campaign’s possible ties to Russia.</p>

<p>It will be the first formal summit meeting for Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin, who have spoken together twice on the sidelines of annual gatherings of world leaders, and it will come at a particularly critical moment, with midterm elections looming in the United States.</p>

<p>“The two leaders will discuss relations between the United States and Russia, and a range of national security issues,” the White House said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Helsinki talks, which will come on the heels of a NATO summit meeting in Brussels on July 11 and 12, could exacerbate American relations with European allies even as it eases tensions with Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump this week sent his national security adviser, John R. Bolton, to Moscow, where he met on Wednesday with Mr. Putin.</p>

<p>Afterward, an aide to Mr. Putin, Yuri Ushakov, reiterated Moscow’s denial that it tried to influence the United States presidential election in 2016, comments that Mr. Trump cited on Thursday in a Twitter post before the meeting with Mr. Putin was announced.</p>

<p>“Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election!” Mr. Trump wrote.</p>

<p>The potential for such a high-level meeting has concerned some American allies in Europe, particularly because of recent tensions between the Trump administration and traditional American allies including Canada, France and Germany.</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that it was important to get along with Russia and other countries.</p>

<p>But a meeting with Mr. Putin, and improving the relationship between the United States and Russia, have long appeared to be priorities for Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>Early in the presidential campaign, before having secured the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump said he thought he and Mr. Putin would hit it off.</p>

<p>“I think I’d get along very well with Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Trump said in the summer of 2015.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump has also said he would consider inviting Mr. Putin to the White House, which would be the first visit by the Russian leader since 2005.</p>

<h2 id="politicalwaroverreplacingkennedyonsupremecourtisunderway">Political War Over Replacing Kennedy on Supreme Court Is Underway</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/us/politics/trump-supreme-court-kennedy.html </p>

<p>The Supreme Court building in Washington. A battle for the future of the court is underway after Justice Anthony M. Kennedy’s announcement on Wednesday that he will retire.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — A political war over replacing Justice Anthony M. Kennedy roared to life on Thursday in Washington, the start of an election-season clash over a Supreme Court retirement that will reshape the country’s judicial future.</p>

<p>Hours after Justice Kennedy’s announcement on Wednesday that he will step down July 31, conservative organizations were mobilizing to support the Republican-controlled Senate in a quick confirmation of a justice who would be expected to vote against the court’s liberal precedents. One group, the Judicial Crisis Network, has already started a $1 million ad campaign urging people to support the president’s choice.</p>

<p>Democrats and liberal advocacy organizations face enormous challenges if they hope to prevent President Trump and the Republicans from installing a conservative justice who would shift the ideological balance of the court for generations. Mr. Trump has promised to pick from a list of highly conservative jurists, and Republicans control the Senate, which can confirm the president’s choice by a simple majority.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump began wooing senators late Thursday night, meeting at the White House separately with three Republicans and with the three Democrats — Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia — who broke party ranks last year and voted to confirm Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the president’s first Supreme Court pick.</p>

<p>After the meeting, Ms. Heitkamp said in a statement that she urged the president to appoint someone who is “pragmatic, fair, compassionate, committed to justice, and above politics.”</p>

<p>But the effect of Justice Kennedy’s departure has already ignited opposition from many Democratic lawmakers, party strategists and liberal activists, who vowed a fierce battle to try to preserve decades of liberal court precedents on abortion, civil rights, gay rights, affirmative action and the death penalty.</p>

<p>“I think it has sunk in very quickly that this is the biggest fight of them all,” said Brian Fallon, a veteran Democratic operative whose organization, Demand Justice, is leading the charge against Mr. Trump’s pick. “If we don’t succeed in this fight, Trumpism will be here for 40 years, not just four years.”</p>

<p>Democratic strategists say the party needs to model its resistance to the successful fight Democratic senators waged in 1987 against Judge Robert H. Bork, President Ronald Reagan’s pick for the Supreme Court. After they defeated Judge Bork, Mr. Reagan eventually settled on Justice Kennedy, who was seen as a more moderate choice.</p>

<p>If they can mobilize Democrats and liberals, lawmakers say they hope to demand a more moderate justice from the current president, as well.</p>

<p>“There are people who have had to withdraw over the years because you get information out and you question them and the public is focused on it and galvanized by it,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and a member of the Judiciary Committee.</p>

<p>LATEST UPDATES Justice Kennedy’s Retirement</p>

<p>Get caught up with the latest from Times reporters and columnists.</p>

<p>Senator Susan Collins, whose vote on a Supreme Court nominee could prove decisive, said she would not vote for someone who showed “hostility” toward Roe v. Wade.</p>

<p>In a New York Times op-ed, the Senate minority leader argued that abortion rights and affordable health care will be endangered if the Senate does not resist the president’s nominee.</p>

<p>Here is a look at some front-runners for the nomination, and the full list of 25 potential nominees.</p>

<p>Do these updates help you stay informed? </p>

<p>Thank you for your feedback.</p>

<p>Demand Justice has begun running online ads against three of Mr. Trump’s possible picks and expects to spend more than $1 million on television ads once the president selects a nominee.</p>

<p>One ad targets Judge Amy Coney Barrett, who is on the president’s list of possible justices, for saying that the Affordable Care Act should have been held unconstitutional. Another ad is aimed at Judge Brett Kavanaugh, another possible pick, for saying that a president should be able to “decide whether and when he can be investigated.”</p>

<p>Democrats say they will focus on two main issues, abortion and health care. Mr. Fallon, who worked for President Barack Obama and was a top spokesman for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, said the challenge will be convincing people that a Trump justice poses a threat to both issues.</p>

<p>“We have to do the work and spend the money to communicate the consequences of what a 5-4 court with a newly installed justice looks like,” Mr. Fallon said.</p>

<p>Democratic lawmakers gathered on the steps of the Supreme Court Thursday morning, flanked by members of progressive groups, to declare their opposition to all of the potential candidates on Mr. Trump’s public list of 25 possible jurists.</p>

<p>At the Capitol, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, warned of the high stakes in filling the vacancy.</p>

<p>“Make no mistake: Republicans now have the opportunity to erase a generation of progress for women’s rights, L.G.B.T.Q. rights, civil rights, workers’ rights and health care,” Ms. Pelosi declared.</p>

<p>Strategists say Democrats must demand that Mr. Trump’s pick for the court affirmatively say whether he or she would uphold Roe v. Wade, the landmark case establishing a right to abortion. Saying that it is “settled law,” as some conservatives concede, is not enough, the strategists say.</p>

<p>Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, has vowed to move swiftly once Mr. Trump announces his choice, but Democratic lawmakers are demanding that a replacement for Justice Kennedy not be confirmed until after the midterm elections in the fall. They argue that voters should be given the opportunity to select the members of Congress they want to vote on the vital selection.</p>

<p>With Kennedy’s Retirement, the Supreme Court Loses Its Center</p>

<p>The swing vote in many decisions, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy shifted toward more conservative opinions in the final months of his 30-year justice tenure.</p>

<p>June 27, 2018</p>

<p>On Thursday Mr. McConnell defended his decision to move forward with filling the vacancy this year.</p>

<p>“This is not 2016,” he said on the Senate floor. “There aren’t the final months of a second-term constitutionally lame-duck presidency with a presidential election fast approaching. We’re right in the middle of this president’s very first term.”</p>

<p>Mr. McConnell pointed to the Supreme Court confirmations of Justices Elena Kagan in 2010, Stephen G. Breyer in 1994 and David H. Souter in 1990 — all midterm election years in a president’s first term.</p>

<p>“To my knowledge, nobody on either side has ever suggested before yesterday that the Senate should only process Supreme Court nominations in odd-numbered years,” Mr. McConnell said.</p>

<p>Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, said that “the 2018 midterm elections just became the most consequential election of our lifetime.”</p>

<p>“We must keep organizing, mobilizing and holding lawmakers to account every single day — and then we need turn out like never before this November,” he said.</p>

<p>Conservatives in Charge, the Supreme Court Moved Right</p>

<p>June 28, 2018</p>

<p>Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, echoed that message in an email to his supporters seeking signatures on a petition.</p>

<p>“We should not vote on a new Supreme Court Justice before the American people vote in November,” Mr. Kaine wrote. “Sign my petition if you agree: No Supreme Court vote until the American people vote.”</p>

<p>There is little chance of that happening, given that Mr. Trump and his allies in Congress want to make sure to act on the court vacancy before the fall elections, when Democrats could regain control of the Senate.</p>

<p>To that end, conservative organizations are planning campaigns to support a speedy confirmation.</p>

<p>“Concerned Women for America is gearing up for our biggest and perhaps most important confirmation battle in our almost 40-year history,” said Penny Nance, the group’s president. “We plan to devote considerable resources to this effort, and we expect to win. Our happy warrior/activist ladies relish the fight and shine in these historic moments.”</p>

<p>Carrie Severino, the chief counsel and policy director of the Judicial Crisis Network, said her organization is already running ads targeting Democratic senators in states where Mr. Trump won during the presidential election.</p>

<p>One ad says: “Like they did before, extremists will lie and attack the nominee. But don’t be fooled. President Trump’s list includes the best of the best.”</p>

<p>Ms. Severino said that she expects liberals to aggressively criticize the president’s pick for the court, no matter who that person is.</p>

<p>“It’s the war on women. Or this person hates the little guy,” she said. “Without even knowing the nominee, we know the directions they will go. Some of these scaremongering tactics have been used since Reagan’s appointees. We are expecting that and we are absolutely prepared.”</p>

<p>Miriam, a Guatemalan asylum seeker with her son Franco at Casa Alitas, a private shelter that provides temporary housing in Tucson, Ariz.</p>

<p>TUCSON, Ariz. — When Luis Cruz left behind his wife, four of their children and the house he’d built himself, he’d heard that American officials might split him from his son, the one child he took with him. But earlier this month, the two of them set out from Guatemala anyway.</p>

<p>The truth, he said this week, moments after they arrived at a cream-colored migrant shelter in Tucson, was that he would rather be apart from his child than face what they had left behind. “If they separate us, they separate us,” said Mr. Cruz, 41. “But return to Guatemala? This is something my son cannot do.”</p>

<p>For years, children and parents caught crossing the nation’s southern border have been released into the United States while their immigration cases were processed, the result of a hard-fought legal settlement designed to keep children from spending long months in federal detention. In the eyes of the Trump administration, this practice has served as an open invitation for people like Luis Cruz, and has played a major role in driving thousands of families across the border with Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump’s newest immigration policies — first an effort to separate families crossing the border, and now an effort to change the legal settlement on migrant family detention — represent an aggressive effort to rescind that invitation, one that has plunged the nation into a debate about the limits of its generosity.</p>

<p>But interviews at shelters and passage points along both sides of the border this week, as well as an examination of recent immigration numbers, suggest that even with tightened restrictions on families, it’s going to be difficult for the president to stanch the flow.</p>

<p>An asylum seeker laced his shoes after immigration agents removed them as a security measure.</p>

<p>Ankle bracelets allow immigration agents to monitor asylum seekers’ whereabouts.</p>

<p>Though it’s impossible to know yet whether the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” crackdown on illegal border crossers will have a significant deterrent effect, one thing was clear this week at the Arizona-Mexico border: Many families — especially those from countries in Central America plagued by gang violence and ruined economies — are making the calculation that even separation or detention in the United States is better than the situation at home.</p>

<p>“Why would you undertake such a dangerous journey?” said Magdalena Escobedo, 32, who works at the migrant shelter here in Tucson, called Casa Alitas. “When you’ve got a gun to your head, people threatening to rape your daughter, extort your business, force your son to work for the cartels. What would you do?”</p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions in April announced a policy of prosecuting all illegal border crossers, yet federal agents caught nearly 52,000 people at the border in May, marking a steady rise in illegal entries after a sharp decline during the first year of Mr. Trump’s administration. More than 250,000 migrants had been arrested this year as of late May, according to data by United States Customs and Border Protection; that number is close to the total number arrested in all of 2017, about 311,000.</p>

<p>Casa Alitas, a low-slung building down a dusty street in Tucson, takes in families who’ve presented themselves to border officials to ask for asylum. Once they’re processed at immigration facilities, authorities drop them off here for a meal and a shower before they head off to stay with friends or relatives and wait for their day in court.</p>

<p>On Thursday, men like René Pérez, 40, who made it into the United States with his son this week, said he was well aware that they might have been separated or placed in custody. “If it happens, it happens,” said Mr. Pérez.</p>

<p>Across the border in the Mexican town of Nogales, many parents preparing to cross the border said temporary separation from their children in the United States would be better than facing the violence back home.</p>

<p>A group of Central American asylum seekers were taken to a shelter in Nogales, Mexico.</p>

<p>Brayan Vicente, 16, felt he had little choice but to leave his home country of Guatemala because of the gang violence there.</p>

<p>“I’d rather accept that, to know that my son is safe,” said Lisbeth de la Rosa, 24, who was waiting in line to enter the United States with her 4-year-old son.</p>

<p>“It’s worth it,” said Lidia Rodríguez-Barrientos, 36, standing with her 9-year-old daughter. “Why? Because we’re afraid to go back.”</p>

<p>What has guided much of border detention policy in recent years is a 1997 agreement in the case Flores v. Reno, in which the federal government was barred from detaining migrant children, save for a short period and under certain conditions. The agreement was interpreted later to include children traveling with their families.</p>

<p>Unwilling to separate young migrants from the parents traveling with them, both the George W. Bush and Obama administrations arrived at the policy of releasing families while they awaited immigration proceedings—though Obama administration officials did so only after having been successfully sued over their policy of holding families together in detention.</p>

<p>Critics, including Mr. Trump, have long said that allowing migrants to go free while their immigration cases are pending encourages parents to enter the United States with children, and some conversations bear that out.</p>

<p>“This is the reason I brought a minor with me,” said Guillermo T., 57, a construction worker who recently arrived in Arizona. Facing unemployment at home in Guatemala, he decided to head north; he had been told that bringing his 16-year-old daughter would assure passage. He asked that only his first named be used to avoid consequences with his immigration case.</p>

<p>“She was my passport,” he said of his daughter.</p>

<p>The Trump administration is asking for changes to the Flores settlement that would allow officials to detain children with their families for longer than the short period allowed under the agreement. Lawyers for the Obama administration already asked for changes to that settlement and were denied. In any case, it’s unclear if that will stop people from coming.</p>

<p>Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a global fellow at the Wilson Center who has interviewed hundreds of Central American migrants in the field, said that they are primarily motivated to leave their countries by violence and lack of economic opportunities, phenomena which she described as closely connected.</p>

<p>She said these migrant families choose the United States because they often have networks in the country already and know that there are many job opportunities. “There are push and pull factors. The push factors are the lack of economic opportunities and the security problems in their countries. It’s a mix of these conditions. The pull factors are of course the jobs and the families.”</p>

<p>Even with steep drops in the number of recorded murders in the past year, El Salvador and Honduras, the home countries of many migrants, are still among the most dangerous countries in the world. Poverty is hammering away at livelihoods in much of Central America, and for some, the decision to leave is a gamble on a better life.</p>

<p>For others, it’s a matter of saving the one they have.</p>

<p>On Thursday, federal officials dropped Mr. Cruz and his 16-year-old son, also named Luis, at Casa Alitas. Both wore black, despite the southwestern heat, and inside, they sat at a table covered with a cloth of bright sunflowers.</p>

<p>They eagerly consumed big bowls of soup before explaining why they had come.</p>

<p>The elder Mr. Cruz, a lemon and orange grove worker, had hoped to live his life in his home state of Suchitepéquez. Then in late May, his son was approached twice by a gang who demanded he join them, flashing a gun and urging him to commit his first extortion. “They kill you if you don’t obey,” said Mr. Cruz.</p>

<p>On June 3, the pair left for the United States, and then presented themselves at the border to ask for asylum. After lunch at the shelter, the younger Mr. Cruz pulled a piece of paper from his pocket, unfolding it to reveal a letter his school director had written before he left — a note they hoped would be the evidence they needed to win asylum in the United States.</p>

<p>“The student had to withdraw himself from school due to violence and gang persecution,” she wrote. “He decided to move to save his life.”</p>

<h2 id="dickleitschwhosesipinwasagayrightsmilestonediesat83">Dick Leitsch, Whose ‘Sip-In’ Was a Gay Rights Milestone, Dies at 83</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Robert D. McFadden</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-21</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/obituaries/dick-leitsch-dead.html </p>

<p>After pouring their drinks, a bartender at Julius’ in the West Village refused to continue to serve participants in a “sip-in” protest in 1966 after they told him they were gay. The bartender placed his hand over one of their glasses. The protesters were identified as John Timmons, Dick Leitsch, Craig Rodwell and Randy Wicker.</p>

<p>Dick Leitsch, who in 1966 led a pioneering act of civil disobedience to secure the right of gay patrons to be served in a licensed bar, helping to clear the way for gay bars to operate openly in New York State, died on Friday at a hospice center in Manhattan. He was 83.</p>

<p>A close friend, Paul Havern, said the cause was liver cancer, which had spread. Mr. Leitsch, who lived in Manhattan, learned he had terminal cancer in February.</p>

<p>A gentle, soft-spoken Kentuckian, Mr. Leitsch (pronounced LIGHTSH) was one of the first leaders of the Mattachine Society, an early defender of gay rights when homosexuality was mostly underground and even a small protest took courage. He called his action a “sip-in,” and likened it to sit-ins by black protesters at segregated lunch counters in the South during the civil rights movement of the 1960s.</p>

<p>Three years before the Stonewall Inn uprising accelerated the gay rights movement in America, Mr. Leitsch challenged the common practice of bars’ serving gay customers under a no-questions-asked arrangement necessitated by an unwritten State Liquor Authority policy that regarded homosexuals as inherently “disorderly.” Bars that knowingly served them could have their liquor licenses revoked.</p>

<p>The policy, supported by no law and apparently unconstitutional because it precluded the right to free assembly, led to charades by gay men and lesbians. They would sometimes minimize their sexual identities by avoiding affectionate touching or dancing with one another or any other conduct that might be interpreted as “queer.” Bartenders looked the other way and poured the gin.</p>

<p>It was just another of the countless indignities and rights violations that gay men and lesbians endured in an age when vice squads raided bars frequented by gay clientele and entrapped men in homosexual “encounters.” Many publications, including The New York Times, referred to gay men and lesbians as “sexual deviates.”</p>

<p>Hypocrisy infected the era. Gay men and lesbians were widely regarded as sick by the medical establishment, sinners by the clergy and criminals by the law. Judges accepted the testimony of undercover officers who had solicited sex from gay men and then arrested them. For those with a name, job or family to protect, lewdness charges could carry fines, jail time and ruinous publicity.</p>

<p>Criminals also took their cut. There were scores of illegal bars in New York, many of them private clubs run by the Mafia, that catered to gays and lesbians. Drinks were watered, prices were steep, police raids were scheduled (with forewarnings), payoffs were routine and liquor licenses, if they existed at all, were rarely challenged by the liquor authority.</p>

<p>“For decades, gay bars were our most visible institutions,” Perry Brass recalled in 2015 in The Philadelphia Gay News. “Gay men and lesbians found their only home in them. In New York, bars were raided cyclically: usually before elections, before major events like the 1964 New York World’s Fair, when Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. closed the bars to keep innocent tourists from wandering in, or when cops decided they wanted to squeeze out a bit more payola from Mafia barkeeps.”</p>

<p>On April 21, 1966, Mr. Leitsch and three friends, Craig Rodwell, John Timmons and Randy Wicker, accompanied by a Times reporter and a Village Voice photographer, staged the “sip-in” at Julius’, a bar at West 10th Street and Waverly Place in Greenwich Village.</p>

<p>The bar had been serving a gay clientele since the 1950s. A clergyman had just been arrested there on charges of soliciting sex, and a sign said, “This is a raided premises.”</p>

<p>As the four stood at the bar in suits and neckties, a bartender set up glasses and asked, “What’ll you have?”</p>

<p>“We are homosexuals,” Mr. Leitsch announced, according to several accounts he gave to the news media. “We are orderly, we intend to remain orderly, and we are asking for service.”</p>

<p>The bartender clapped his hand over Mr. Leitsch’s glass — a signal moment captured by the Voice photographer, Fred W. McDarrah — and refused to serve them.</p>

<p>“I think it’s the law,” the bartender said.</p>

<p>The Times published an account the next day: “3 Deviates Invite Exclusion by Bars.” The Mattachine Society, citing the events at Julius’, said it would sue the State Liquor Authority to overturn the policy that prohibited bars from knowingly serving alcoholic beverages to gays on grounds that they were inherently “disorderly.”</p>

<p>The liquor authority chairman, Donald S. Hostetter, promptly denied that such a policy existed, and claimed that the authority had never threatened or revoked the licenses of bars that served gays.</p>

<p>Mr. Leitsch, in an interview for this obituary in March, said that the lawsuit had not been filed because the liquor authority had backed down. “The whole thing was bizarre,” he said. “We didn’t need to prove that the bars refused to serve us, or that the liquor authority revoked licenses for serving gays. They denied ever doing it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Leitsch, left, in 2016 with Randy Wicker at the bar Julius’ in Greenwich Village, where both participated in a “sip-in” protest demanding gay rights in 1966. They were marking the event’s 50th anniversary.</p>

<p>In 1967, New York State courts, ruling on two suits filed by bars, struck down theories that homosexuals were inherently disorderly, effectively ending the liquor authority practice of using gay patronage as an excuse for revoking licenses. Among other effects, the rulings opened the way for licensed gay bars, which proliferated in years to come.</p>

<p>“Dick Leitsch was one of the country’s most militant and important gay activists in the decade before Stonewall,” George Chauncey, a Columbia University historian who wrote “Gay New York” (1994), said in an email. “The sip-in he organized at Julius’ is a brilliant example of lessons he took from the black civil rights movement about how to stage events that reframed public understanding.”</p>

<p>After years of stony silence from public officials and potential allies in his fight against police raids and entrapment cases, Mr. Leitsch, starting in 1966, won the support of John V. Lindsay, the new Republican-Liberal mayor of New York; of William Booth, the commissioner of human rights; and of columnists for The New York Post, then a progressive paper, who wrote about police corruption. Weeks after the protest at Julius’, Mr. Lindsay ordered the Police Department to halt the entrapment of gays, although many gay men said his orders were ignored, at least initially.</p>

<p>Historians of the gay rights movement say Mr. Leitsch was instrumental in ending police entrapment in New York. Besides helping to persuade Mr. Lindsay to ban it, he worked with bar owners, the American Civil Liberties Union, police brass and other city officials to gradually overcome the practice. He also advised gay men how to navigate arrests in sting operations, and urged entrapped men to request lawyers and plead not guilty, forcing courts to bring their cases to trial, where the testimony of arresting officers could be challenged. In court, gays were urged to present themselves as model citizens, in suits and ties.</p>

<p>The Mattachine Society’s gradual approach to change became obsolete overnight on June 28, 1969, when the Stonewall raid triggered an explosive protest that roiled Greenwich Village for a week and transformed a gay men’s reform agenda into an L.G.B.T. revolution.</p>

<p>On the morning after the raid, as the violent protests spread, Mayor Lindsay called Mr. Leitsch and pleaded, “You’ve got to stop this!”</p>

<p>“Even if I could, I wouldn’t,” Mr. Leitsch reportedly replied. “I’ve been trying for years to get something like this to happen.”</p>

<p>David Carter, the author of “Stonewall: The Riots That Sparked the Gay Revolution” (2005), called Mr. Leitsch a pivotal figure in the fight for gay rights.</p>

<p>“The historical evidence suggests that Leitsch’s total success in persuading the Lindsay administration to end entrapment and his partial success in legalizing gay bars constituted a liberalization that was the most essential precondition of the Stonewall uprising,” Mr. Carter said in an email.</p>

<p>Richard Joseph Leitsch was born in Louisville, Ky., on May 11, 1935, the oldest of four children of Joseph Leitsch and Ann (Moran) Leitsch. His father owned a wholesale tobacco business. Richard, called Dick, and his siblings, John, Joanne and Laurene, grew up in a Roman Catholic household and attended parochial schools.</p>

<p>Dick was attracted to boys at St. Patrick’s elementary school. At Flaget High School, he was a voracious reader, worked in the library stacks and had several homosexual encounters, he said. He graduated in 1953. His family was supportive when told he was gay. At Bellarmine University, in Louisville, he appeared in theatrical productions, but dropped out before graduating.</p>

<p>Mr. Leitsch moved to New York in 1959, met Mr. Rodwell and formed his first long-term partnership. Mr. Rodwell belonged to the Mattachine Society, and persuaded Mr. Leitsch to join. In the early 1960s he was inspired by Franklin Kameny, one of America’s earliest gay rights activists, who urged gays to model their struggle after the civil rights movement.</p>

<p>At a time when many gay men concealed their sexual identities, Mr. Leitsch was open about his. As Mattachine’s president from 1965 to 1969 and then as executive director, he faced television cameras, briefed reporters and lectured widely, never worrying about his jobs as a bartender, waiter and journalist for gay publications.</p>

<p>One Leitsch article detailed the Stonewall uprising for the Mattachine newsletter and later appeared in The Advocate, the L.G.B.T. magazine. “Those usually put down as ‘sissies’ or ‘swishes’ showed the most courage and sense during the action,” he wrote. “Their bravery and daring saved many people from being hurt.”</p>

<p>After Stonewall, Mr. Leitsch was criticized by younger, louder voices of the Gay Liberation Front as being insufficiently militant. “Dick and Mattachine were loathed by many of my young G.L.F. brothers and sisters,” Mr. Brass recalled. “For us he represented gay accommodationists.”</p>

<p>It passed. Mr. Leitsch was eventually seen as an early hero of the gay rights movement. Julius’ became a landmark in the National Register of Historic Places and a setting for gay-themed films like “The Boys in the Band” and “The Normal Heart.” It called itself the oldest gay bar in New York. Mr. Leitsch dined there often.</p>

<p>On the 50th anniversary of his protest, a crowd celebrated at Julius’, and Andrew Berman, of the Greenwich Village Historic Preservation Society, hailed Mr. Leitsch and his sip-in. “This was one of the first, if not the very first, planned acts of civil disobedience for L.G.B.T. rights,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Leitsch is survived by his brother, John, and his sister, Joanne Williams. His partner of many years, Timothy Scoffield, died in 1989 after developing AIDS.</p>

<p>In the crush of letters Mr. Leitsch received after his illness became known was one from former President Barack Obama. “Thank you for your decades of work to help drive our nation forward on the path toward L.G.B.T. equality,” he wrote. “Our journey as a nation depends, as it always has, on the collective and persistent efforts of people like you.”</p>

<h2 id="thesupremecourttakesonthepoliceuseofcellphonerecords">The Supreme Court Takes On the Police Use of Cellphone Records</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alex Abdo</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-21</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/opinion/carpenter-supreme-court-cellphone-records.html </p>

<p>The Supreme Court has handed down what may be the most important privacy case of the digital era, ruling on Friday that the government cannot force cellphone service providers to hand over their users’ locations over significant periods of time without first getting a warrant. The decision, United States v. Carpenter, is the latest in a steady drip of rulings by the Supreme Court over the past two decades that are gradually defining the Fourth Amendment right to privacy in a world of ever-evolving technology.</p>

<p>The case began with the investigation of a series of armed robberies in southeastern Michigan and northwestern Ohio. The police suspected a man named Timothy Carpenter and ordered his cellphone service provider to turn over all data revealing Mr. Carpenter’s movements. Even though the police had no warrant, the service provider complied with the request, giving the police a trove of data showing the suspect’s movements over the course of 127 days. That information included a list of every call he had made during that period as well as his geographical location at the beginning and end of each of those calls.</p>

<p>The question the case presented was deceptively simple: Can the police collect your cellphone location data for days on end without a warrant? A 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court said no. But even in reaching what it characterized as a “narrow” conclusion, the court took a significant step that will shape the constitutional right to privacy in the modern age.</p>

<p>Specifically, the court cut back on the scope and reach of the “third-party doctrine” — a legal presumption, embraced by the Supreme Court in the 1970s and ’80s, that if you share information with a third party, you have forfeited your right to privacy regarding that information. It’s the rationale used to justify the police’s warrantless access to the garbage you place out on the street, to your call records and to your bank statements.</p>

<p>The application of the third-party doctrine has been logically inconsistent and confusing, and it is particularly ill suited to the digital age. When the doctrine was created, people generally kept their private effects — their journals, correspondence and the like — in their sole possession. It was perhaps understandable, in that world, that the Supreme Court often conditioned privacy on the secrecy of the information. It made sense to say that if you want something to remain private, you shouldn’t share it with others.</p>

<p>But it’s easy to see why that concept is untenable in modern times, when virtually everything we do requires sharing sensitive information with third parties. Today’s world is a networked one: Cellphone companies catalog our every movement. Internet service providers log every web page we visit. Credit-card companies, email providers, social-media services, fitness apps — all of these third-party services keep detailed diaries of our lives.</p>

<p>Are all of these records up for grabs by the government without a warrant?</p>

<p>At least for the cellphone location records at issue in the case, the answer is no. Writing for the court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. observed that the location tracking technology turned against Mr. Carpenter could be used to construct “a detailed chronicle of a person’s physical presence compiled every day, every moment, over several years.” He rejected the government’s effort at “mechanically applying the third-party doctrine” to that technology. Cellphone location records are especially sensitive, Chief Justice Roberts explained, and cellphone customers do not “share” them with their providers in any ordinary sense of that word.</p>

<p>In his dissent, Justice Samuel Alito said the court’s decision will “guarantee a blizzard of litigation” over the application of the Fourth Amendment to other new technologies.</p>

<p>He may be right about that blizzard, but only because of the countless ways that new technology can be used to intrude on individual rights. The chief justice listed just a few of the innovations that are likely to make their way to the Supreme Court in coming years: real-time cellphone location tracking by the police and “tower dumps,” used by the police to download activity from a cell tower during a specific period to identify or track a suspect.</p>

<p>And that list of technologies that could end up before the court is much longer because the government can monitor more than just our movements; it can track every purchase we make, every website we visit, every television show or movie we watch, every contact we email and more. Whether the government may do so without a warrant is an open question following the Carpenter decision.</p>

<p>The chief justice stressed that the court was not expressing “a view on matters not before us.” Still, how the lower courts apply Friday’s ruling to new technologies will be pivotal in defining the future of not only our right to privacy but also our freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Imagine if the government had the power to force cellphone and internet providers to disclose the contact lists of journalists and their suspected sources, the names of protesters at a rally or the phone numbers and email addresses of everyone who contacted the author of a report critical of the government — all without a warrant. The rights of free speech, assembly and association secured by the First Amendment would be hollowed out by authority that expansive.</p>

<p>Those are the real stakes of the Carpenter decision. While the court didn’t directly address these questions, it paved the way for their resolution, free from doctrinal anachronisms and sensitive to the threats to individual rights in the bold but scary world of modern technology.</p>

<h2 id="xxxtentacionskillerstrackedhimasheenteredmotorcycledealership">XXXTentacion’s Killers Tracked Him as He Entered Motorcycle Dealership</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ben Sisario</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-21</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/arts/music/xxxtentacions-killers-charged.html </p>

<p>Investigators surround a vehicle after the rapper XXXTentacion was fatally shot on Monday.</p>

<p>The killers of the rapper XXXTentacion were tracking him in his last moments on Monday afternoon, following the rapper into a motorcycle dealership before shooting and robbing him in his car less than half an hour later, according to court documents.</p>

<p>In a sworn affidavit, Detective John Curcio of the Broward Sheriff’s Office described detailed evidence taken from video surveillance — including images of orange sandals worn by one of XXXTentacion’s killers — that led to the arrest on Wednesday of Dedrick D. Williams, 22, on charges including first-degree murder.</p>

<p>In the affidavit, Detective Curcio says that XXXTentacion, an influential 20-year-old rapper whose real name was Jahseh Onfroy, arrived at Riva Motorsports in Deerfield Beach, Fla., at 3:30 p.m. on Monday, with an unidentified friend. Two minutes later, two men got out of a dark sport utility vehicle and followed the rapper into the store; one, described as wearing a white tank top and bright orange sandals, bought a mask at the parts department, paying cash.</p>

<p>The two men then left the store and moved their car to the north gate of the parking lot, where, according to the affidavit, XXXTentacion tried to exit in his BMW at 3:55. The S.U.V. blocked him, and the two men — now masked and armed — stepped out of the car and “demanded property.”</p>

<p>“After a brief struggle, the victim is shot,” Detective Curcio wrote. The men removed a bag from XXXTentacion’s car and drove off.</p>

<p>To identify the assailants, the police sent images from the video to patrol units. Examining Mr. Williams’s Instagram feed, they found recent pictures of him wearing “the same or similar bright orange sandals.” Employees of the dealership also identified Mr. Williams — a tattoo artist who appears to have ties to the local rap scene — from photographs.</p>

<p>The affidavit, dated Tuesday, makes no mention of what happened to XXXTentacion’s friend.</p>

<p>Mr. Williams was held without bond after a hearing on Thursday, and is scheduled to appear before a criminal court judge on Monday.</p>

<p>The Broward Sheriff’s Office did not respond to a request for comment about the investigation on Friday afternoon. The Broward Public Defender’s Office, which represented Mr. Williams, could not be reached for comment.</p>

<p>The sheriff’s office has said it is “seeking additional suspects.”</p>

<p>XXXTentacion began releasing music on his own five years ago, and has become one of the most influential rappers of his generation. His most recent album, “?,” opened at No. 1 on the Billboard chart in March.</p>

<p>But he also drew wide controversy for disturbing allegations of abusive behavior, leading to him briefly being barred this year from Spotify’s playlists. XXXTentacion was awaiting trial on charges including aggravated battery of a pregnant victim, false imprisonment and witness tampering.</p>

<p>News of XXXTentacion’s death spread online within hours, and his music once again began to dominate online platforms. On Tuesday, his songs were streamed 10.4 million times around the world on Spotify, setting a record, and “?” is expected to reach the Top 5 on Billboard’s next chart.</p>

<p>The bartenders at the original Boxers on West 20th Street, as much of an attraction as the mac-and-cheese bites.</p>

<p>Jay and Anita Earle were having a good time at Boxers, a gay sports bar on the Upper East Side, on a recent Wednesday night. Which was a little surprising.</p>

<p>The Earles are a lesbian couple, so they were probably unmoved by the shirtless male bartenders. And, though competing in a trivia contest, they were leaving most of their answers blank. They also live on the Upper West Side, so this was not a quick walk home. Surely the nachos weren’t that good.</p>

<p>“It’s a nice, mellow place,” Jay said. Anita agreed: “People say it’s gay Hooters, but it’s so much better than Hooters.”</p>

<p>Such is the unlikely success of Boxers, which made its debut in 2010 and has become a commercial unicorn: a gay sports bar chain. From its original location on West 20th Street, it expanded into Hell’s Kitchen and the Upper East Side; there is an outpost in Philadelphia. Another Boxers is scheduled for a Labor Day opening in Washington Heights. Gym Sportsbar, which bills itself as “America’s most popular gay sports bar,” has three locations: Fort Lauderdale, Los Angeles and Chelsea. By sheer volume, Boxers is possibly the most popular gay bar in the city.</p>

<p>In the years since Boxers opened, gay New Yorkers have won the right to marry and to serve openly in the military. The Stonewall Inn, the Greenwich Village flash point of gay rights, was enshrined as a National Historical Landmark; an AIDS memorial was erected on Greenwich Avenue; Jason Collins played with the Brooklyn Nets as the NBA’s first openly gay player; Laverne Cox went from waitressing in Union Square to gracing the cover of Time as a transgender icon; and Ritchie Torres, a city councilman, became the Bronx’s first openly gay representative. The city’s gay pride parade is now so mainstream that last year it was televised nationally.</p>

<p>Yet, amid a gay renaissance of broader, nonconforming sensibilities — queer, transgender and woke — Boxers has bet on old-school, meat-market machismo. It is frequently described as “gay Hooters,” not only for its Chippendales-style seminude employees but also its menu, which feels plucked from a Midwestern airport: Cap’n Crunch French toast, cheese fries, toasted cheese ravioli, chicken tenders, and macaroni &amp; cheese bites.</p>

<p>It seems to be paying off — $2 Taco Tuesdays and all.</p>

<p>With the Washington Heights opening, Boxers expects to pass the $10 million mark in annual sales this year, said its owners, Bob Fluet and Rob Hynds. They have requests for franchises in California, Florida, Ohio, London and Rio de Janeiro, they said, and are scouting a Chicago location. Both men still work their longtime professions: Mr. Fluet is a general contractor in New Jersey and owns an auto body shop; Mr. Hynds is a real estate agent in Connecticut. They’re both married (not to each other) and admit to being quite suburban. “I mean,” Mr. Fluet said, “I wear Hanes.”</p>

<p>According to Daniel Nardicio, the well-traveled gay night-life impresario who holds parties all over the city, including at Boxers, the bar is not cutting edge but necessary. “They’re not bland, but they’re basic,” Mr. Nardicio said, referring to both the bars and its owners. “They’re kind of gay Hooters, but really they’re gay TGI Fridays. And let me say, before the pitchforks come for me, we need that. We need a comfortable space. We are entitled to everything straight people have, including our own vanilla. I’m from Cleveland. I like TGI Fridays.”</p>

<p>The city did not always embrace Boxers. The owners were denied their first bid at an expansion into Hell’s Kitchen, in 2011. “We thought, O.K., it’s a gay neighborhood, a gay community board,” Mr. Fluet said. Yet the board recommended against granting a liquor license. For the owners, it felt familiar. The day before signing the original Boxers lease, they were also rebuffed, they said, for being a gay bar. They ended up in different spots in both neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Historically, gay bars have been side-street hideaways, architecturally closeted warrens of secrecy. Boxers, by contrast, features huge windows frequently at corner locations.</p>

<p>“Most gay bars in the city are just one thing. It’s leather daddies, it’s twinks, it’s a coke den or this or that; Boxers is pretty much just everyone,” said Matt Cárdenas, a brand ambassador for Chappy, a gay dating app that stages events at bars across the city, including at Boxers. “There’s not a lot of bitchiness, and that alone sets it apart.”</p>

<p>Israel Gutierrez, an ESPN commentator who fondly recalled a visit to the downtown location in 2015, the year he came out, agreed: “So many gay bars try too hard. Who wants to try so hard when they go out? I just want a big place that’s not too crowded, not too loud, where I can hang out with my friends.”</p>

<p>Boxers currently sponsors 15 of the city’s 30-odd gay sports leagues, translating into roughly 25 individual teams sporting Boxers-branded jerseys, said Mr. Fluet. “There’s a gay yacht club!” he said. “I remember them because they asked for ginger beer and we had to special order it.”</p>

<p>Going against the grain of a stylish, status-conscious New York night life scene, Boxers has focused squarely on various underserved bases: blue-collar, low-key, outer-borough and uptown gays. Boxers bills itself as hosting the city’s largest black- and Latino-focused gay parties, each at about 600 people weekly, and also has run Arab- and Asian-focused parties. “It’s crazy to us that, in the 21st century, there’s still bigotry in the gay community of all places,” Mr. Fluet said.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Boxers’ core appeal is its bartenders. The formula for their allure cuts a cunning line between candid and crude. They are about as explicitly erotic as a cover of Men’s Fitness. They all have horror stories of lewd behavior by unruly customers. But, said Paulo Flor, a gay Brazilian bodybuilder who tends bar at the Upper East Side outpost, “There is much more good than bad.”</p>

<p>On a recent Monday night at the downtown flagship, Brandon McCullough, 27, an advertising associate from the Upper East Side, pointed to two bartenders: Juan Pablo Verjel, who always half-apologizes for being a Mets fan, and Thomas Consoli, a hulking 6-foot-5 aspiring state trooper. “I’ve known J.P. since he was a barback,” said Mr. McCullough. “Tom is like a big brother. Actually, I know his brothers. They’re shot boys here. These guys miss me when I’m gone. We’re invested in each other.” Mr. McCullough got upset when a reporter divulged weeks of Boxers reconnaissance. “Gay Hooters?” he asked. “Gay TGI Fridays? Gay Coyote Ugly? No!” He held his palms out, fingers flared and said, “You’ve got the story wrong!” He held the rebuke silently until finally his hands fell crisscross upon his heart. “It’s gay Cheers.”</p>

<p>As if on cue, Mr. Consoli and Mr. Verjel greeted an incoming group of customers by their names.</p>

<h2 id="innewyorkevenacountofseparatedchildrenproveselusive">In New York, Even a Count of Separated Children Proves Elusive</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-21</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/nyregion/in-new-york-separated-children-questions-unanswered.html </p>

<p>Children wearing masks at Cayuga Centers in East Harlem. The agency has 243 separated children in its care, the mayor said, the most of any group in the state.</p>

<p>On Friday, officials in New York still did not have answers to even the most basic questions about the children who had been separated from their parents at the southern border and relocated 2,000 miles away: How many were there, and where had they been placed?</p>

<p>Both Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio sent letters demanding that information from the United States Department of Health and Human Services. When it was not forthcoming, Mr. Cuomo threatened the 10 agencies that had accepted the separated children, and which the state also regulates, to turn over the children’s names or lose their operating certificates.</p>

<p>But because they are bound by their contracts with the federal government not to disclose information about children in their care, the agencies said they could not share it, even with the state.</p>

<p>So faith leaders and local elected officials pieced together the numbers: About 60 children each at Catholic Guardian Services, Lutheran Social Services of New York and Abbott House, all in the Bronx, according to officials who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the information. Another 19 had been at the Westchester children’s residence visited by Mr. Cuomo on Thursday. And there were 243 at Cayuga Centers in East Harlem, according to the latest figures from the mayor’s office. Officials seemed to be learning new numbers every few hours, as they tried to account for the 700 children Mr. Cuomo spoke of on Thursday.</p>

<p>The confusion underscored just how chaotic the situation was, with lawyers frantically scrambling to figure out how to represent the children, and Cayuga, which had the most children, urgently looking for staff and asking for more Spanish-speaking volunteers to serve as foster parents.</p>

<p>Represenative Adriano Espaillat, who toured Cayuga’s building on Friday, said that “the social workers and the therapists that we met with seem to be very much under control.”</p>

<p>Mr. de Blasio blamed the Trump administration for the mess. “This was thrown together, this family separation policy, with no preparation for trying to figure out where kids would go that made any sense,” he said on WNYC radio on Friday.</p>

<p>The mayor said that it made sense to Cayuga officials that children were sent to New York, because there were “not a lot of places near the border that had this ability, as organizations, to provide the social services and provide a setting for these kids, or had enough foster care placements.”</p>

<p>The president ended the policy of separating children from their parents at the border with an executive order on Wednesday, but there was not yet any plan in place to reunite them.</p>

<p>While their parents have faced prosecution at the border, the children are entitled to their own hearings. But getting to one is a tangled process that can take days, if not weeks. Immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza only meets several times a month to decide the fate of detained children, and getting cases on the docket is outside the lawyers’ control.</p>

<p>Migration counselors, as well as agency social workers, try to locate the parents first — and at least some of those parents have already been deported. “It’s not the same thing as, we met you today, we saw you today, we represent you; this is a process on a case-by-case basis,” said Anthony Enriquez, the legal director of the unaccompanied minors program for Catholic Charities, a nonprofit organization that has been meeting with the children. It has 12 lawyers and a federal contract to work with unaccompanied minors.</p>

<p>Though many other lawyers have volunteered to help without pay, getting them into government-contracted facilities to see children under federal custody “takes a lot of coordination and requires permission,” Mr. Enriquez said.</p>

<p>And if the children are unable to make their wishes about their case known — at least one child as young as 9 months has been placed in New York, and some may speak indigenous languages rather than Spanish — Catholic Charities refers them to yet another organization with a federal contract. That group, the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, provides “ad litem” support to children in New York, to advocate for the best interests of the child, but only has two lawyers and one social worker in New York. On Friday, another lawyer was on the way.</p>

<p>“We have received a lot of referrals for very young children for the last couple of months, and we’re handling a lot of these cases,” said Elizabeth Frankel, the associate director of the Young Center.</p>

<p>Even if a child has a private lawyer, the process is not streamlined.</p>

<p>José Xavier Orochena, who is representing three Guatemalan children at Cayuga who were separated from their mother in McAllen, Tex., said he has encountered nothing but red tape. He called Catholic Charities to coordinate his representation. “I’m waiting for a call back,” he said.</p>

<p>“I called 26 Federal Plaza asking what’s their court date,” he said of the children. A lawyer for the government told him that the children’s cases were “not even in the State of New York, and there’s nothing we have initiated against them as of today.”</p>

<p>Their mother, meanwhile, awaits her own court date at a detention center in Arizona, where Mr. Orochena will represent her, too.</p>

<p>Representative Adriano Espaillat, a Democrat from northern Manhattan who toured Cayuga’s building on Friday — where children were seen wearing homemade masks, apparently to shield their identities — said the chaos was not evident inside. “I think they were very much under control,” he said, “and the social workers and the therapists that we met with seem to be very much under control.”</p>

<p>Mark Levine, a city councilman who also toured the center, said it was “desperate for more staff” and would be organizing a job fair on Monday.</p>

<p>Allison Sesso, the executive director of the Human Services Council of New York, an umbrella organization whose members include some of the 10 agencies, asked for some patience. “At the end of the day, these nonprofits are trying to be there for the kids,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="rachelcamposduffysayssomeblacksfindimmigrationcentersbetterthanpublichousing">Rachel Campos-Duffy Says Some Blacks Find Immigration Centers ‘Better Than’ Public Housing</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Sarah Mervosh</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-22</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/us/fox-news-rachel-campos-duffy.html </p>

<p>Rachel Campos-Duffy (above, in 2013) said on Thursday that “some African-Americans” found immigration detention centers preferable to housing projects.</p>

<p>Rachel Campos-Duffy, a Fox News contributor, drew stinging criticism this week after she compared immigration detention centers favorably with public housing, backing up her thesis by citing the opinions of unnamed African-Americans.</p>

<p>“I spoke to some African-Americans who say, ‘Gosh, the conditions of the detention center are better than some of the projects that I grew up in,’” Ms. Campos-Duffy, a conservative commentator, said Thursday night during an appearance on the Fox News Channel talk show “The Ingraham Angle.”</p>

<p>As her comment reverberated across social media on Friday, some people questioned whom, exactly, Ms. Campos-Duffy had spoken with and pushed back against associating African-Americans with poverty in public housing. Some poked fun at her language, noting that “Black people don’t say ‘gosh.’”</p>

<p>1) Black people don't say 'gosh'</p>

<p>2) Black people don't talk to Rachel Campos-Duffy</p>

<p>3) If you take a kid away from its parents crying and screaming, it doesn't matter how nice the accommodations are. You're still a monster.</p>

<p>4) You can come &amp; go from the projects. It's not jail. https://t.co/Dgsik1gg1N</p>

<p>— Crystal Methanny (@RafiDAngelo) June 22, 2018</p>

<p>Ms. Campos-Duffy defended her comment on Friday night in a series of text messages with The New York Times, saying that she believed the facilities where immigrant children are being detained are safe and secure.</p>

<p>“The centers are not ideal, but they are safe, supervised, and provide three square meals, instruction and other resources,” she wrote. “Those are indeed better conditions than many poor American children have.”</p>

<p>“As an American mom,” she added, “I have compassion for these kids too.”</p>

<p>Ms. Campos-Duffy did not directly address criticism that associating black people with public housing was a stereotype. She said that she based her comment on a recent conversation with one man who is African-American, not multiple African-Americans, as she originally stated.</p>

<p>“I mentioned it because I HAD just spoke to an African American who complained to me about never seeing this level of media attention about Black kids being separated from their parents and that some of the facilities he saw looked nicer and safer than the projects he grew up in,” she wrote.</p>

<p>Online, critics pointed out that all kinds of people live in public housing, and that children there are not kept in cages. The New York City Housing Authority, the country’s largest public housing authority, served about 171,000 families in public housing as of Jan. 1, 2015; 45 percent were black, according to data the agency provided on its website.</p>

<p>Ms. Campos-Duffy, a former reality TV star who appeared on MTV’s “Real World: San Francisco” in the early 1990s, is now a television personality who offers commentary on everything from politics to parenting. Last year, she was included on Newsmax’s list of the 50 most influential Latino Republicans. She is married to United States Representative Sean Duffy, a Republican from Wisconsin.</p>

<p>During her appearance on “The Ingraham Angle” on Thursday, Ms. Campos-Duffy discussed immigration detention centers, including Melania Trump’s visit to the border. Her appearance came just a few days after the show’s host, Laura Ingraham, drew criticism for describing the centers where the children were being held as “essentially summer camps.”</p>

<p>Both Ms. Ingraham and Ms. Campos-Duffy referred to an article that described a facility for unaccompanied immigrant children as similar to a boarding school. The article, in The San Diego Union-Tribune, reported that the facility had classrooms and a play area with soccer goals, for example.</p>

<p>On Friday, Ms. Campos-Duffy wrote that she was not surprised at the reaction to her comment, which she said came from the political left.</p>

<p>“Conservative minorities are accustomed to being attacked for telling the truth,” she said.</p>

<h2 id="onfamilyseparationfederalworkersoftenagonizedoverenforcement">On Family Separation, Federal Workers Often Agonized Over Enforcement</h2>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/us/migrant-children-federal-agency-border.html </p>

<p>The Paso del Norte International bridge between the United States and Mexico.</p>

<p>The federal bureaucracy that carried out the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy was conflicted over it: As some officials supported the seizing of children from their migrant parents under orders from the White House, others felt helpless in their cubicles, shed tears and went home wracked with guilt.</p>

<p>A career official at the civil rights office of the Homeland Security Department, whose job is to process complaints by people who feel they have been mistreated, watched staff members crumple into tears at their desks. They were overwhelmed with hundreds of pleas a week, written on behalf of migrant parents and children searching desperately for one another. The pleas came with photographs taken at the border of the missing children. They showed “5-year-olds who don’t know how to take a picture without smiling,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “They look like school photos.”</p>

<p>A manager in the same department printed some of the photographs in an attempt to seek support, both logistical and emotional, from Cameron Quinn, who was appointed by President Trump to oversee their work, the official said. The manager presented Ms. Quinn with the children’s photos at a meeting.</p>

<p>Interviews with more than a dozen employees at the three federal agencies tasked with carrying out the president’s orders said they were feeling alienated and exhausted after being ordered to carry out, then halt, the separations — as well as deal with the fallout.</p>

<p>On Friday, protesters gathered outside the Alexandria, Va., home of Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security, demanding her resignation over the policy. They distributed leaflets calling her a “child snatcher.” Some of those much further down the government’s pecking order said they faced pressures of their own, according to interviews with officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, United States Customs and Border Protection and the Health and Human Services Department.</p>

<p>An undocumented immigrant at a federal court in McAllen, Tex.</p>

<p>“There’s an eye-of-the-hurricane feeling,” said an ICE official involved in the deportation of a 6-year-old boy who was separated from his father. The official had “no idea” where the boy’s father was and had considered quitting in recent weeks, but decided to stay “to provide balance and bear witness and see it through.”</p>

<p>Whether they endorsed the president’s policy or abhorred it, employees across the federal system expressed frustration that major changes came without advance notice. One official who works on custody issues at ICE said an email about the executive order reversing the policy arrived “literally at the same time that it was breaking on CNN.”</p>

<p>Anguish over family separation began at the Health and Human Services Department, which cares for children in federal custody, within months of Mr. Trump’s taking office, when representatives of the new administration started to float ideas for more aggressive enforcement actions, officials said.</p>

<p>Employees of the agency, some of whom are social workers and child advocates, said they had protested the idea. They hoped it would be dropped after the public outcry that followed an acknowledgment last year by John Kelly, who was then the secretary of Homeland Security, that it was under consideration. White House officials subsequently backed away from the idea.</p>

<p>But starting last fall, employees of the agency noticed a surge in children coming into their care who had entered the country with a parent, according to an official there who has served under two administrations. By April, the numbers had risen to more than 700. The administration initially claimed that separations were not happening but eventually acknowledged that they were.</p>

<p>Before the policy was called to a halt, Mr. Trump and his aides alternately embraced the crackdown and blamed it on Democrats.</p>

<p>At ICE, sympathetic employees from across the agency sprang into action after the zero-tolerance policy was announced to help reunite parents and children, according to two officials there.</p>

<p>Employees in Washington dialed up field offices in an effort to reconnect families. People worked at their desks late into the night, searching for data that could be used to reunify families. Late Saturday night, the Department of Homeland Security said 522 children had been reunited with their parents.</p>

<p>After Mr. Trump called on Wednesday for an abrupt end to the separations, significant questions remained over what to do with adults in custody who claimed that their children had been taken. Should they be released and allowed to pick up the children, many of whom have been sent to shelters in far-flung states? Should they be held in custody and only reunited before deportation, which could take months?</p>

<p>At the Border Patrol, where many are seen as supporting the president’s hard-line stance on the border, two agents worried that the effort to reunite parents and children, if not done carefully, could end up leaving children with human traffickers. One of the officials spoke of children who had been apprehended with methamphetamine strapped to their waists and who were traveling with adult smugglers.</p>

<p>Considerable confusion has mounted at ICE over how to proceed now that the family separation practice had been suspended. Inside the Border Patrol, high-ranking officials shot off a flurry of emails into the early hours of Thursday morning with evolving guidance.</p>

<p>One message, sent at 9:54 p.m. on Wednesday by Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings, ordered agents to “immediately suspend” prosecutions of migrant parents “and maintain family unity.” Later messages told the agents to use discretion in deciding whether to reunify parents and children right away or to wait.</p>

<p>At the Health and Human Services Department, the suspension of the policy prompted a scramble to begin reuniting parents and children. One official put the number of cases at 3,000, higher than the official counts from the government.</p>

<p>“The reaction was a little bit of happiness but not glee or anything,” the official said. “It was like ‘O.K., how do we get them back to their parents?’”</p>

<h2 id="75percentofamericanssayimmigrationisgoodforcountrypollfinds">75 Percent of Americans Say Immigration Is Good for Country, Poll Finds</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Niraj Chokshi</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-22</p>

<p>A newspaper salesman in front of the entry to the United States from Nogales, Mexico. Many Americans view immigration as a top concern ahead of this fall’s midterm elections.</p>

<p>Most Americans oppose the separation of immigrant families at the border, and a larger share of people than at any point since 2001 say immigration is good for the nation.</p>

<p>Those were just some of the findings of polls published in the past week that shed new light on attitudes toward immigration, a subject that many Americans view as a top concern ahead of this fall’s midterm elections.</p>

<p>While most oppose President Trump’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border, fellow Republicans were more likely to support it than not, the polls found. Since the polls were conducted, however, the president caved to public pressure and agreed to stop the separation policy by detaining families at the border together for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>And despite the president’s anti-immigration message, three in four Americans say immigration is generally good for the nation, according to Gallup, the polling organization.</p>

<p>“Americans’ strong belief that immigration is a good thing for the country and that immigration levels shouldn’t be decreased present the president and Congress with some tough decisions as the midterm elections loom,” Gallup said in a news release Thursday.</p>

<p>Here’s what the recent polls show.</p>

<p>Record support for immigration</p>

<p>Americans generally view immigration as a ‘good thing.’</p>

<p>A record-high 75 percent of Americans say immigration, in general, is a “good thing” for the country today. </p>

<p>Source: Gallup</p>

<p>Despite the contentious political climate, 75 percent of Americans think immigration, in general, is good for the nation, according to Gallup, which surveyed more than 1,500 adults during the first two weeks of June.</p>

<p>Among Democrats and those who lean toward the party, 85 percent viewed immigration positively, compared with 65 percent of Republicans and those who lean Republican.</p>

<p>When asked their thoughts about “legal immigration” specifically, even more Americans, about 84 percent, said it was good for the country.</p>

<p>Support for reining in immigration is at its lowest level in more than half a century: Just 29 percent of Americans believe it should be decreased, the smallest share recorded by Gallup since at least 1965.</p>

<p>Strong opposition to separating families</p>

<p>Majorities opposed family separation at the border</p>

<p>Though they asked in different ways, multiple polling organizations found that Americans generally opposed President Trump’s now-reversed policy of separating families at the border. </p>

<p>Source: Quinnipiac University, Ipsos, Economist/YouGov</p>

<p>Several recent polls found that most Americans disagreed with President Trump taking a hard-line approach to immigration enforcement by separating families at the border.</p>

<p>“When does public opinion become a demand that politicians just can’t ignore?” Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll, said in a statement this week, announcing the results of a recent survey of more than 900 voters conducted last week and weekend. “Two-thirds of American voters oppose the family separation policy at our borders.”</p>

<p>Two similar polls of adults — one conducted by Ipsos and another conducted by YouGov with The Economist — found comparable results, albeit with smaller majorities opposing the policy.</p>

<p>In all three polls, those surveyed were about twice as likely to oppose separating families as to support it. But there was a large partisan divide: Republicans were more likely to support family separation than oppose it, while Democrats overwhelmingly disliked it. Independents strongly opposed the policy, just not to the same degree as Democrats.</p>

<p>“Neither quotes from the Bible nor get-tough talk can soften the images of crying children nor reverse the pain so many Americans feel,” Mr. Malloy said in the statement. The administration was heavily criticized after Attorney General Jeff Sessions used a Bible passage to justify the separation policy and images of weeping children began to circulate widely.</p>

<p>The nation’s top problem?</p>

<p>Immigration has also emerged as a top policy concern among Americans: Those who were asked this month to name the most important problem facing the nation were more likely to bring up the issue than any other, according to a Pew Research Center survey of about 2,000 adults.</p>

<p>When Pew asked that same question in January 2017, immigration was cited less often than health care, the economy, unemployment, race relations and Donald J. Trump, then the president-elect.</p>

<p>Gallup found similar results: The share of Americans who said immigration was the top problem facing the country rose to 14 percent in June, from 10 percent the month before.</p>

<p>Both polls found that Republicans cited immigration far more often than Democrats. Still, Pew found that about one in five Democrats and Republicans alike wanted local candidates to discuss the issue this fall.</p>

<h2 id="standingbyasprisonersareraped">Standing By as Prisoners Are Raped</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Lovisa Stannow</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/opinion/prison-rape-sexual-violence.html </p>

<p>It is well known among prison reformers that the East Mississippi Correctional Facility, a private prison, is a cesspool of violence and sexual abuse. The horrific conditions there have long been out in the open, thanks in large part to a class-action lawsuit brought in 2013 on behalf of the prisoners, on which a judge will rule any day now.</p>

<p>In April, the prison reached a new level of notoriety after a video was released of an inmate being beaten unconscious by other prisoners. The video runs nearly 30 minutes before corrections officers casually enter the frame — negligence made more appalling by the fact that an officer had filmed the attack.</p>

<p>Given the prison’s track record, it would seem like a foregone conclusion that an audit of its efforts to stop rape among prisoners as well as that perpetrated by staff members would turn up scores of problems.</p>

<p>It didn’t.</p>

<p>In 2015, an auditor assessed whether the facility complied with the Prison Rape Elimination Act’s standards — a set of strong federal regulations aimed at ensuring safe ways to report abuse behind bars and improving medical and mental health care in prisons, among other provisions. The picture he painted was at odds with the reality there.</p>

<p>The auditor, a former corrections official himself, declared that the prison “is well managed and staff well trained in their assignments” and that it is “a safe place to serve time.” At an exit meeting with prison management, he praised staff on a job well done, writing that he had “congratulated the facility staff about the progress made in compliance with the P.R.E.A. standards.”</p>

<p>The contrast between that sham audit report and what I have heard from prisoners could not be more dramatic.</p>

<p>Walnut Grove was a private prison in Mississippi that’s been closed that had a history of inmate abuse and was also run by the Management and Training Corporation.</p>

<p>One of the prisoners, a man I’ll call Thomas, has been sexually assaulted numerous times by other prisoners. After one especially brutal attack, he tried to file a report with a prison officer.</p>

<p>“This is prison,” the officer responded. “Stop being gay.”</p>

<p>Anyone paying attention knows that the East Mississippi Correctional Facility is a house of horrors. So what accounts for the profound differences between the facility described in the audit report and the one depicted in the recent video and in accounts from prisoners like Thomas?</p>

<p>The answer cannot be that the auditor happened to visit the facility on two unusually calm days in May 2015, or that he interviewed only inmates who were somehow oblivious to the chaos around them. Even if the plumbing was working on those days and the floors were not soaked with inmates’ blood, the auditor’s job is to examine compliance over the previous 12 months.</p>

<p>Press reports, the federal lawsuit and inmate letters all show that violence and sexual abuse persisted during that time.</p>

<p>A closer look at prior reports by that auditor paints a troubling picture. A year earlier, he had conducted an audit of Walnut Grove Correctional Facility, a Mississippi prison so infamous it recently closed.</p>

<p>Walnut Grove was a private prison run by the Management and Training Corporation, just like the East Mississippi Correctional Facility. The auditor’s report on Walnut Grove mirrored his report on E.M.C.F., declaring it to be “well managed and staff well trained in their assignments” and “a safe place to serve time.”</p>

<p>And as he had done at the East Mississippi prison, the auditor conducted an exit interview where he “congratulated the facility staff on their progress made in compliance with the PREA standards.” This same language is repeated in reports he made in audits of prisons in New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas. These reports are the definition of rubber stamp audits and, as such, antithetical to, and clearly subverting, the intent of the Prison Rape Elimination Act audit process.</p>

<p>He’s not the only auditor who conducts such problematic reviews. An analysis by my organization has found that scores of dangerous prisons are passing their audits with flying colors. These sloppy assessments are a missed opportunity for much needed corrections oversight. Worse, they give cover to cynical officials looking to weasel their way out of accountability for devastating sexual violence.</p>

<p>In fact, the spokesman for Management and Training Corporation has held up the E.M.C.F. audit report as proof that the facility is well run. The prison even has a plaque declaring that it is compliant with the act, which must seem bitterly ironic to the hundreds of men condemned to live there.</p>

<p>The Justice Department is not blind to the serious flaws of these audits. To their credit, officials there released strong audit guidelines last year. But that isn’t enough. The pool of auditors, who have been certified by the Justice Department, is dominated by former corrections officials who are either unable or unwilling to point out deadly practices that are right under their noses.</p>

<p>Equally troubling is the lack of transparency around auditor decertification. It seems that the man who audited the East Mississippi prison had been the go-to auditor of the Management and Training Corporation. He is no longer certified, but the reason why is anyone’s guess. And his pitiful audits still stand as valid.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Congress has an opportunity right now to rectify the problem. On May 22, the House approved the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill that would establish stronger guidelines for conducting an audit and harsher — and more transparent — sanctions for auditors who flout them.</p>

<p>The First Step Act still has to be approved by the Senate, and while it has strong bipartisan support, nothing is guaranteed in today’s political climate.</p>

<p>But one thing is certain: if the audits are allowed to fail, the Prison Rape Elimination Act will fail, and the shameful scourge of prisoner rape will continue.</p>

<h2 id="atroublingprognosisformigrantchildrenindetentiontheearliertheyreoutthebetter">A Troubling Prognosis for Migrant Children in Detention: ‘The Earlier They’re Out, the Better’</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Benedict Carey</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-17</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/health/migrant-children-mental-health.html </p>

<p>Migrants from Central America were taken into custody last week by Border Patrol agents near McAllen, Tex.</p>

<p>Some youngsters retreat entirely, their eyes empty, bodies limp, their isolation a wall of defiance. Others cannot sit still: watchful, hyperactive, ever uncertain.</p>

<p>Some compulsively jump into the laps of strangers, or grab their legs and hold on for life. And some children, somehow, move past a sudden separation from their parents, tapping a well of resilience.</p>

<p>The Trump administration’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents has alarmed child psychologists and experts who study human development.</p>

<p>It is not clear how long the administration plans to hold onto the 2,000 children in detention centers near the border, nor how long before they are returned to their families.</p>

<p>But psychologists have learned a great deal about what happens to institutionalized children over time, and in that research there are clues to the potential emotional harms faced by migrant children severed from their parents.</p>

<p>A number of medical organizations, including those governing psychology, psychiatry and pediatrics, have issued letters of protest, citing an increased risk of anxiety and depression in the children, as well as post-traumatic stress and attention-deficit disorder.</p>

<p>“Traumatic life experiences in childhood, especially those that involve loss of a caregiver or parent, cause lifelong risk for cardiovascular and mental health disease,” wrote the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.</p>

<p>The longer-term consequences of separation and institutionalization are hard to predict and depend on many factors, like the age of the child at separation and the time away from family.</p>

<p>Lengthy deprivation between infancy and school age, for example, raises the risk of lasting emotional problems.</p>

<p>The risk of mental health consequences also depends on the holding facility itself — the staff, the turnover, whether children know where their parents are, and how long they’ll be held.</p>

<p>And much depends on the individual child. Resilience can be forged in such situations, for reasons no one understands. But success for the institutionalized child is far from the norm.</p>

<p>Institutions — even the best and most humane — by their nature warp the attachments children long for, the visceral and concentrated exchange of love, tough and otherwise, that comforts, supports and shapes a child’s heart and mind.</p>

<p>In orphanages and other institutional settings, “turnover rate of caregivers is high, as is the number of children per caregiver,” Marinus van IJzendoorn, a professor of human development at Erasmus University Rotterdam, said in an email.</p>

<p>“This causes impersonal, unstable and fragmented care, which not only impacts on attachment or stress regulation but also on physical growth parameters such as height, weight and head circumference, and brain development.”</p>

<p>Children in institutions, Dr. van IJzendoorn continued, “bide their time hoping for better, personalized care that only families can provide.” Once these children enter foster care or are adopted, their development accelerates, and many catch up to peers within two or three years, Dr. van IJzendoorn said.</p>

<p>But much depends on how long they were held in detention: a longer stay at a later age requires the longest recovery period, he noted.</p>

<p>“So many of these parents are fleeing for their lives,” Dr. Colleen Kraft, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, wrote in a public statement after a recent trip to the border. “So many of these children know no other adult than the parent who brought them here.”</p>

<p>Even the study of parental deprivation has been ethically fraught.</p>

<p>In the 1950s, the American psychologist Harry Harlow took young rhesus monkeys from their mothers and found that the youngsters became reclusive.</p>

<p>In one experiment, he found that they would quickly cling to “cloth mothers,” inanimate figures with a soft exterior. Those sad images still haunt the psychological literature.</p>

<p>Early in this century, American researchers working with Romanian officials found that children moved from that country’s notorious orphanages into foster care later had higher I.Q.’s on average than a comparison group of their peers deliberately left behind in the orphanages by the scientists.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most influential of them all, to modern child psychologists, was John Bowlby, the British scientist whose writings in the mid-20th century argued that infants were evolutionally primed to form attachments, not only for protection but also for emotional and cognitive development.</p>

<p>The quality of the primary attachment to (usually) a mother — whether strong and loving, uncertain, or absent — helps determine the trajectory of a child’s unfolding life.</p>

<p>Dr. Bowlby’s attachment theory informs many approaches to the treatment of children torn from their parents by circumstance or, in the case of current administration policy, by design.</p>

<p>Kalina Brabeck, a psychologist at Rhode Island College who works with immigrant children who lose their parents to deportation or for other reasons, said that the experience of loss often leads to a form of post-traumatic stress — the paralyzing vigilance, avoidance and emotional gusts first identified in war veterans.</p>

<p>Most of the children held on the border will have accumulated traumas, Dr. Brabeck said. Even before their parents were detained, many already had run the gauntlet of immigration itself, fleeing with little resources from often violent communities.</p>

<p>One goal of treatment, she said, is to overcome what is a daily identity crisis.</p>

<p>“We try to get them to tell a story: who they are, where they were born, what they’re good at, their migration story,” she said. “We may do that with pictures and drawings, as well as words — to walk through it in very detailed way.”</p>

<p>The therapy includes grief counseling, she said, and prodding the children to confront unconscious assumptions — for example, that the world is an inherently unsafe place. “We also work to connect them to other supports, like coaches, teachers and churches,” she said.</p>

<p>For all the dislocation, strangeness and pain of being separated forcibly from parents, many children can and do recover, said Mary Dozier, a professor of child development at the University of Delaware.</p>

<p>“Not all of them — some kids never recover,” Dr. Dozier said. “But I’ve been amazed at how well kids can do after institutionalization if they’re able to have responsive and nurturing care afterward.”</p>

<p>“The earlier they’re out, the better,” she added. “The most important thing for these children now is what we do next.”</p>

<h2 id="the4formerfirstladiescondemntrumpsborderpolicy">The 4 Former First Ladies Condemn Trump’s Border Policy</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Matt Stevens</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-18</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/us/politics/first-ladies-trump-family-separation.html </p>

<p>Former first ladies, clockwise from top left: Michelle Obama, Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter and Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>In the weeks since the Trump administration instituted a zero tolerance policy that seeks to criminally prosecute anyone who crosses the border unlawfully and effectively causes children to be separated from their families, criticism has poured in from advocacy groups, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and a host of political luminaries who are no longer in office.</p>

<p>Now, in the span of about 24 hours, all four living former first ladies have added their voices to the chorus of public critique, calling the practice “immoral,” “disgraceful” and a “humanitarian crisis.”</p>

<p>Even the current first lady, Melania Trump, took the somewhat unusual step of issuing a statement that appeared to align somewhat with her predecessors, while also avoiding assigning partisan blame.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Trump hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform,” her office said in a statement on Sunday. “She believes we need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart.”</p>

<p>The rare public show of unity among several former first ladies drew a response Monday afternoon from Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, who acknowledged that “calling attention to this matter is important” and said the situation at the border is “a very serious issue” that Congress needs to fix, according to a transcript of her remarks.</p>

<p>Asked about the criticisms, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said a prior administration was to blame.</p>

<p>“Frankly, this law was actually signed into effect in 2008,” she said.</p>

<p>Though the administration officials have called on lawmakers to close loopholes, no law actually requires that families be separated at the border. President Trump ordered the stiffer effort last month — and it is the zero tolerance policy that results in unlawful immigrants being taken into federal criminal custody, at which point their children are considered unaccompanied alien minors and taken away.</p>

<p>Here’s a look at what each former first lady has said — and how each of their husbands dealt with immigration during their time in office.</p>

<p>Rosalynn Carter</p>

<p>In a statement released by the Carter Center on Monday, Rosalynn Carter condemned the Trump administration’s approach.</p>

<p>“The practice and policy today of removing children from their parents’ care at our border with Mexico is disgraceful and a shame to our country,” Mrs. Carter said.</p>

<p>In 1980, her husband, Jimmy Carter, initially offered so-called open arms to tens of thousands of Cuban refugees — many fleeing communism. He later abandoned the offer in favor of program designed to reduce the influx of refugees and exclude those who had been imprisoned in Cuba for serious nonpolitical crimes.</p>

<p>Separately, Mr. Carter increased the number of Southeast Asian boat refugees who were allowed to resettle here after the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>Hillary Clinton</p>

<p>At first, Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic nominee for president, offered only a very brief comment on the Trump administration policy.</p>

<p>“YES!” she wrote, signaling her agreement with a tweet by her husband, Bill Clinton, who said on Twitter on Father’s Day that children who had been separated from their parents “should not be a negotiating tool.”</p>

<p>Then, in a series of tweets on Monday, Mrs. Clinton offered additional thoughts, calling situation at the border “a humanitarian crisis.”</p>

<p>“Every parent who has ever held a child in their arms, every human being with a sense of compassion and decency, should be outraged,” she wrote.</p>

<p>“We should be a better country than one that tears families apart, turns a blind eye to women fleeing domestic violence, and treats frightened children as a means to a political end,” Mrs. Clinton added.</p>

<p>During her husband’s administration, an anti-immigrant backlash arose in response to the number of Mexicans streaming across the border.</p>

<p>Mr. Clinton was at first caught flat-footed to the new political dynamics and had a “mixed record” on the issue, but by the end of his presidency had helped pass some pro-immigrant legislation, said Frank Sharry, executive director of America’s Voice, a pro-immigrant advocacy organization.</p>

<p>Laura Bush</p>

<p>In an opinion article published on Sunday by The Washington Post, the former first lady Laura Bush nodded to her Texas roots in urging politicians in Washington to “do better to fix this.”</p>

<p>“I live in a border state,” she wrote. “I appreciate the need to enforce and protect our international boundaries, but this zero tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart.”</p>

<p>She added, “It is our obligation to reunite these detained children with their parents — and to stop separating parents and children in the first place.”</p>

<p>However, it was her husband, George W. Bush, who initiated the “zero tolerance” approach for illegal immigration on which Mr. Trump’s policy is modeled — a point Ms. Sanders alluded to on Monday.</p>

<p>In 2005, Mr. Bush began Operation Streamline, a program along a stretch of the border in Texas that referred all unlawful entrants for criminal prosecution, imprisoning them and expediting assembly-line-style trials geared toward rapid deportations. The initiative yielded results and was soon expanded to more border sectors.</p>

<p>Back then, however, exceptions were generally made for adults who were traveling with young children, as well as juveniles and people who were ill.</p>

<p>In general, Mr. Bush “had a moderate approach to immigration,” said Mary Fan, a former federal prosecutor in California who is now a law professor at the University of Washington.</p>

<p>Ms. Fan, who was a prosecutor during the Bush years, said the former president let law enforcement working at the border use discretion in deciding which immigrants were worth prosecuting.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Michelle Obama, who succeeded Mrs. Bush as first lady, retweeted her predecessor’s opinion article and said simply, “Sometimes truth transcends party.”</p>

<p>But her husband’s administration was also heavily criticized for how officials responded to its own immigration crisis. Indeed, Barack Obama earned the nickname “deporter in chief” for expelling more people than any other president in history.</p>

<p>During Mr. Obama’s second term, Central American migrants, including many unaccompanied children, began surging across the border. Obama administration officials recently told The New York Times that they considered the possibility of separating parents from their children, but said they quickly decided against it.</p>

<p>Instead, they decided to vastly expand the detention of immigrant families and open up new facilities along the border, in which children and their parents could be held together. In the meantime, officials began publicly warning parents that their children would be deported if they entered the United States illegally.</p>

<p>Eventually, images emerged of young children — many dirty and some in tears — who were being held with their families in makeshift detention facilities. Then came legal challenges, and soon afterward Obama administration officials decided to release the families pending the resolution of their asylum cases.</p>

<p>On other immigration issues, Mr. Obama took a looser stance. In 2012, he took executive action to protect young people who were brought to the United States as children, in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA. He also eventually shifted the priorities for deportation, so that officials focused on removing convicted criminals, foreigners who posed national security threats and people who recently crossed the border.</p>

<p>“It was a huge sea change from two million deportations to ‘let’s just focus on bad actors,’” Mr. Sharry said.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has tried to end DACA, and, in contrast to Mr. Obama, is treating all people who have crossed the border without authorization as subject to criminal prosecution.</p>

<h2 id="governorsrefusetosendnationalguardtobordercitingchildseparationpractice">Governors Refuse to Send National Guard to Border, Citing Child Separation Practice</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Matthew Haag</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-18</p>

<p>Members of the United States National Guard in April near the border with Mexico in South Texas.</p>

<p>Governors from at least eight states have announced that they would withhold or recall National Guard troops from efforts to secure the United States’ border with Mexico, as the debate over the Trump administration’s practice of separating children from their parents at the southern border seeped into state political battles in an election year.</p>

<p>Many of the governors opposed to sending troops were Democrats, from states including New York, North Carolina and Virginia. But two Republican governors who face re-elections this fall in Maryland and Massachusetts also reversed their plans.</p>

<p>“Until this policy of separating children from their families has been rescinded, Maryland will not deploy any National Guard resources to the border,” Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said on Twitter on Tuesday. “Earlier this morning, I ordered our four crew members &amp; helicopter to immediately return from where they were stationed in New Mexico.”</p>

<p>Some other Republican governors, under growing pressure to weigh in on the much-debated policy, voiced dissatisfaction over the separation issue, though some stopped short of addressing their state’s National Guard assistance.</p>

<p>In Illinois, Gov. Bruce Rauner, a Republican who is expected to face a difficult election challenge this fall, said he opposed the policy and called on President Trump to halt it. (The state did not respond to questions about sending the National Guard to the border.) In Nebraska, Gov. Pete Ricketts, a Republican, issued a series of messages on Twitter voicing his dismay: “While there seems to be a lot of misinformation and propaganda regarding the situation on our border, one thing is clear: Children should not be separated from their families.”</p>

<p>But other Republican governors in deeply conservative states voiced strong support for the president’s “zero tolerance” policy.</p>

<p>“America is a nation of laws, and I am grateful is administration is enforcing them,” said Gov. Phil Bryant, Republican of Mississippi. “Every state must make similar decisions when removing a child who has been neglected or abused by their parents. It is an unfortunate reality of our justice system.”</p>

<p>Gov. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, a Republican who is close to Mr. Trump and faces a runoff election next week, said he supported the White House and signaled that he would not change his state’s Guard deployment to the border.</p>

<p>“The president wanted troops at the border,” Mr. McMaster said on Monday during a campaign stop in Spartanburg. “South Carolina sent troops to the border.”</p>

<p>During April and May, federal authorities separated at least 1,995 children from parents facing criminal prosecution for unlawfully crossing the border, the Trump administration announced on Friday. Photographs and an audio tape of crying children caught in the administration’s dragnet stoked new outrage this week, leading members of both parties to express concern.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump and two members of his cabinet have forcefully defended the “zero tolerance” policy, with the president repeatedly making the false accusation that only the Democrats, the minority party, were to blame for it. The law does not require the authorities to separate children.</p>

<p>The issue, which turns on federal immigration policy, might have been largely a question left to leaders in Washington, not governors. But the Trump administration’s request for National Guard troops earlier this year has thrust the matter into the state-level debate as well.</p>

<p>President Trump called in April for the National Guard to be deployed to the border, saying that thousands of troops were needed to stanch illegal crossings, even though they are at a 46-year low.</p>

<p>In recent days, Democratic governors from states like Colorado, Delaware, New York and Rhode Island have expressed deep opposition to family separation, and many declared they would not help at the border. For many of the governors, the defiance — which was being embraced by left-leaning constituents in their states — was largely symbolic, since they had not been planning to send large numbers of soldiers in the first place, if they had been asked at all.</p>

<p>“Under normal circumstances, we wouldn’t hesitate to answer the call,” said Gov. John Carney, Democrat of Delaware, who said he had declined a request on Tuesday to send troops to the border. “But given what we know about the policies currently in effect at the border, I can’t in good conscience send Delawareans to help with that mission.”</p>

<p>Gov. Roy Cooper, Democrat of North Carolina, said that the “cruel policy of tearing children away from their parents requires a strong response” and that he was pulling his state’s small contingent — three troops — from the border.</p>

<p>Gov. Ralph S. Northam of Virginia said Tuesday that he was recalling four troops and one helicopter.</p>

<p>And for Republican governors up for re-election this year in blue states, like Mr. Hogan of Maryland, Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, and Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont, the practice has prompted them to remind voters that there are issues on which they disagree with Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>“It’s cruel and inhumane, and we told the National Guard to hold steady and to not go down to the border, period,” Mr. Baker, who had initially pledged to deploy two Guard troops and a helicopter, said on Monday.</p>

<p>Yet the “zero tolerance” policy was presenting a far more fraught situation for governors in purple states.</p>

<p>Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa, a Republican who is seeking election in November, voiced dissatisfaction with the policy in a news conference on Tuesday. “It’s just horrific that, you know, children are being used as a pawn in this situation,” she said, adding that Congress needed to take action.</p>

<p>Gov. Christopher T. Sununu, a Republican seeking re-election in New Hampshire, said that the state’s National Guard had not been contacted by the administration, but that he “will not send our New Hampshire troops to the southern border to separate families.”</p>

<p>And Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who is running for Senate in Florida, said in a letter to the Health and Human Services Department that the practice of separating children from their families “needs to stop now.”</p>

<p>But McKinley Lewis, an aide to Mr. Scott, suggested there were no plans to change the deployment of three Guard troops to the border. “Governor Scott will not play politics with the National Guard,” Mr. Lewis said.</p>

<p>Before Monday, Massachusetts had joined several states, mostly those in the South and led by Republican leaders, in support of the president’s order to dispatch National Guard troops. In Texas, which shares a 1,200-mile border with Mexico, Gov. Greg Abbott has pledged up to 1,400 troops, the largest contingent of all the states. The Defense Department has authorized up to 4,000 soldiers to be assigned to the border.</p>

<p>Several governors refused the request at the outset. Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon, Democrat, said days after Mr. Trump’s order that she would not comply if asked to send troops. Mr. Scott, the Republican of Vermont, said he was not “eager” to send troops, and his spokeswoman, Rebecca Kelley, said Mr. Scott “made clear to the Vermont National Guard Adjutant General at that time that he would not be sending troops in response.” Gov. Jerry Brown of California, also a Democrat, dispatched some soldiers to his state’s southern border but limited their roles, angering the president.</p>

<p>Correction: June 19, 2018</p>

<p>An earlier version of this article misstated the political affiliation of the governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. He is a Republican, not a Democrat.</p>

<h2 id="thedystopiaishere">The Dystopia Is Here</h2>

<p>The Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, where undocumented immigrants are held.</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES — When Donald Trump was announced the winner of the Electoral College — but not the popular vote — I was just finishing a book of short stories. They addressed many difficult issues, like poverty, bigotry and violence. But as the grandson of Mexican immigrants, I felt I had to write one last story, one that would confront this man who got himself elected on a platform of hate and a promise to wall off the country of my grandparents.</p>

<p>So I wrote “The Great Wall.” In the dystopian future of the story, the wall is a golden, gaudy monstrosity decorated with bas-relief scenes from the president’s life, from his childhood to his TV career to him signing executive orders.</p>

<p>But the real monstrosity of the story is the detention center in San Diego, Calif., just inside the wall where the children are kept until they are allowed to wave goodbye to their parents through cloudy plexiglass, before the parents are loaded into black buses and deported.</p>

<p>I wanted my story to serve as a cautionary tale of what our country could devolve into if Mr. Trump’s immigration policies were fully realized. But now this is our reality: Sons and daughters are being ripped from their parents’ arms — in some cases, literally — and detention centers are filled with frightened children. In immigrant communities, the fear is palpable, with parents asking themselves if they should risk taking their children to school, or going to work or reporting a crime, lest they become vulnerable to a sweep by immigration agents.</p>

<p>Elsa Johana Ortiz Enriquez back at home in Guatemala. Ms. Ortiz was separated from her son Anthony, who is 8, before being deported.</p>

<p>No one is safe. Just this week we learned of Jose Luis Garcia, a grandfather and authorized resident since the 1980s, who was handcuffed and taken by federal immigration officers while he watered his lawn in front of his home in Southern California. We also learned of Elsa Johana Ortiz Enriquez of Guatemala, who traveled through Mexico and crossed the border into the United States with her 8-year-old son, Anthony, only to be arrested and then separated in the most horrifying of ways: After pleading guilty to unlawful entry, Ms. Ortiz was put on a plane back to Guatemala while her son was transferred to a shelter for migrant children.</p>

<p>If you live in a city like Los Angeles, the odds are that the victims of these policies are your neighbors and co-workers, the classmates of your children and the families who worship with you. You cannot pretend this is not happening here, now, and to people you know.</p>

<p>Some people in the Trump administration have defended the “zero-tolerance” policy — which has separated some 2,000 children from their parents — by pointing to Scripture and blaming their political opponents. Mr. Trump himself is — worse yet — openly using the children’s suffering as a bargaining chip to get funding to build his wall. “The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda,” he tweeted, before demanding that they agree to an immigration bill that pays for the wall. He capped his tweet with a rallying cry apparently aimed at supporters of his immigration policies: “Go for it! WIN!”</p>

<p>Nothing, not in Scripture, not in the law, can justify harming children to make a political point.</p>

<p>A dystopia is an imagined, horrific place where people’s humanity is replaced by fear. That’s what I thought my story depicted — a place where my characters were stripped of their humanity and security, a place that was not yet real. I had hoped it would sound a warning about what our country could become if no one stood up to Mr. Trump. I am sickened to admit that — in its essential details — my dystopian tale has come true.</p>

<p>“And Italian Roma? Unfortunately we have to keep them,” Italy’s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, said on Monday during an interview on a regional television station.</p>

<p>ROME — He has compared the European Union to the Titanic, accused the left of supporting immigration to supply slave labor, and insulted migrants using any number of disparaging epithets. But Italy’s new interior minister, Matteo Salvini, went too far even for his allies this week when he announced that he would conduct a census of Roma people in Italy, a prelude to expelling those without valid residence permits.</p>

<p>“And Italian Roma? Unfortunately, we have to keep them,” Mr. Salvini said on Monday during an interview on a regional television station.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, he dug in his heels. “ ‘Census’ of Roma and control of public funds. If the left proposes it, it’s fine, if I propose it, it’s RACISM,” he wrote on his Facebook page. “I’m not backing down, and am going forward. Italians first and their security.”</p>

<p>Reaction was immediate. Luigi Di Maio — leader of the Five Star Movement, coalition partner of Mr. Salvini’s far-right League party — said that a census on an ethnic basis was not constitutional, so “we can’t do it.”</p>

<p>Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, in Berlin to meet with his German counterpart, Angela Merkel, was infuriated by Mr. Salvini’s remarks and said that the interior minister “had gone too far,” according to Italian news reports. The prime minister did not comment publicly.</p>

<p>The proposal for the census evoked distant but still-bitter memories of the racial laws against Jews and the Roma, instituted by Mussolini’s government 80 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Salvini, leader of the League party, is considered the most powerful political figure in Italy — more so than the prime minister, a little-known independent who was chosen by the governing coalition to be the ostensible head of the barely three-week-old government.</p>

<p>Best known for his anti-immigration views, Mr. Salvini made headlines worldwide recently by refusing to allow a ship that had rescued hundreds of African migrants from dinghies in the Mediterranean to dock at Italian ports. He declared that Italy would no longer be “Europe’s refugee camp.”</p>

<p>Though the League and Five Star are theoretically partners, Mr. Salvini has commandeered the political conversation, if not the agenda, veering toward right-wing, populist and nativist positions that have not always sat well with his allies.</p>

<p>Italian news organizations noted on Tuesday that whenever Mr. Conte was about to step out on the international stage, as he did in Berlin on Monday, Mr. Salvini managed to steal the limelight. The interior minister’s comments on the Roma drew the first significant grumblings from his coalition partners, and Mr. Di Maio scrambled to have his voice heard.</p>

<p>“Italians have priority,” said Mr. Di Maio, who is minister for labor and economic development. “It’s fine to deal with problems related to immigration, but let’s start working on the problems of millions of Italians who can no longer eat.”</p>

<p>The Roma, also known as Romanies or Gypsies, are a people of South Asian origin who migrated centuries ago to Europe, where they have often suffered severe discrimination. Some have lived in itinerant communities, largely isolated from the societies around them, while many others have settled and integrated.</p>

<p>Carlo Stasolla, the president of the Associazione 21 Luglio, which works to end the marginalization of Roma groups in Italy, said in an interview on Tuesday that if Mr. Salvini wanted to conduct a census of the Roma, he need only read the annual reports that his association has been publishing for the last three years.</p>

<p>He would learn, Mr. Stasolla said, that “six out of seven Roma pay taxes,” most own homes or pay rent, and that only about 26,000 live in camps, “segregated areas” that were “created by previous right-leaning governments,” or in informal settlements, he said.</p>

<p>He said that more than 50 percent of the country’s Roma population, estimated at between 120,000 and 180,000 people, were Italian citizens. A large percentage of the rest were from Romania or from the former Yugoslavia, and are considered stateless, “so they can’t be expelled,” he said.</p>

<p>Beyond Mr. Salvini’s threats, Mr. Stasolla voiced concern that the government’s stated agenda for the Roma — which includes closing irregular camps and removing children from Roma parents who do not send them to school — was moving toward “xenophobic and populist positions that could violate fundamental human rights.”</p>

<p>Santino Spinelli, a musician who is one of Italy’s best-known Roma performers, said he feared that Mr. Salvini’s statements could have bleaker consequences.</p>

<p>“Instigation to racial hatred starts with words, and gives people the impression that they are shielded from any consequences, so that anything could happen,” he said in a telephone interview.</p>

<p>“Many Italians don’t even know that the Roma were also victims of racial hatred during the Second World War, as the Jews were, and this becomes of greater concern with new fascist tendencies rising.”</p>

<p>Now that the interior minister had closed Italy’s ports to people escaping war and famine, he could increase his popularity by “hunting Gypsies,” Mr. Spinelli said.</p>

<p>Last week, three white men shouting “Salvini! Salvini!” drove by two men from Mali and fired a compressed air gun at them, lawyers for the migrants said on Tuesday. They said the incident, in Caserta, near Naples, had been reported to the police, and that the victims, one of whom was hit, were very frightened.</p>

<p>One of the lawyers, Ida Grasso, said a security camera near the site where the shooting took place might have captured the license plate of the car. “At least we hope so,” she added.</p>

<p>In February, a white gunman wounded six African immigrants in Macerata, in central Italy, in what the previous interior minister called a “display of racial hatred.” The suspect reportedly draped himself in an Italian flag and raised his arm in a Fascist salute before being arrested.</p>

<p>Italy’s Jewish community has also weighed in on Mr. Salvini’s latest move, issuing a statement that said that there was no justification for the “disturbing proposal” to register specific social groups, and “submit them to special security policies that are reserved for them alone.”</p>

<p>Mr. Salvini’s proposal to conduct a census “is worrisome and reawakens memories of racist laws and measures that were enacted only 80 years ago, but are sadly increasingly forgotten,” the statement said.</p>

<p>But Mr. Salvini’s openly aggressive attitude has clearly struck a chord. Many Italians posted comments on Mr. Salvini’s social media feeds praising his decision.</p>

<p>A survey published on Monday by the Italian pollster SWG showed that in the three months since the election, when it won the largest number of seats, the League has gained in popularity.</p>

<p>Mr. Stasolla said he was concerned that Mr. Salvini’s populist message was taking root among Italians “who believe you can respond to complex issues with simple slogans that single out scapegoats.”</p>

<p>“This is the real drama,” he said, “that populism has infected broad segments of the Italian population at a speed we could not have anticipated.”</p>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-18</p>

<p>Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Emmanuel Macron of France discussed at a meeting Tuesday how to put out the growing number of populist fires over migration on the Continent.</p>

<p>BERLIN — It was supposed to be the day when President Emmanuel Macron of France received a long-awaited response from Germany on his big ideas on how to rekindle Europe as a force for liberalism in the world.</p>

<p>And he did, sort of.</p>

<p>But his meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Tuesday was overshadowed by the urgent issue of how to put out the growing number of populist fires over migration on the Continent — including in Germany itself.</p>

<p>Ms. Merkel, faced with a rebellion by Bavarian conservatives that nearly brought down her government on Monday, is staring at a 10-day deadline to reach the kind of European accord on limiting migration that has eluded the European Union for many years.</p>

<p>On Tuesday she came one small step closer. When Mr. Macron was asked whether he would take back asylum seekers who were first registered in France if Germany refused them at the border, as demanded by the Bavarians, Mr. Macron obligingly said he would. “I confirm,” he said.</p>

<p>France would be obligated to do so under the bloc’s current regulations, but they have proved hollow as Europe has been confronted with millions of migrants and refugees from war-torn Syria, Libya, northern Africa and Afghanistan in recent years.</p>

<p>More than 200,000 migrants sought asylum in Germany last year, and it is on pace to receive as many requests this year, according to Germany’s Federal Office for Migration and Refugees. In 2016, more than 700,000 migrants and refugees asked for asylum in Germany.</p>

<p>Ms. Merkel’s coalition party in Bavaria would like to send back any asylum seeker who has first registered in another European country. But that would mean creating a border in the border-free Schengen zone, which Ms. Merkel thinks would mean the breakdown of free travel, a jewel in the European crown.</p>

<p>In part because Ms. Merkel needs French support in her effort to find a new European consensus on how to address migration, she reached several agreements with Mr. Macron on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Ms. Merkel agreed to a joint budget for the countries that share the euro, which would be separate from the larger European Union budget and would be established as soon as 2021. She also assented to a European reinsurance arrangement for unemployment. Both measures were once unthinkable for Ms. Merkel’s fiscally conservative country.</p>

<p>Their meeting at the Meseberg palace outside Berlin, which took place in advance of a European summit at the end of June, was intended to address broad European issues, but it was marked as well by each leader’s domestic political challenges.</p>

<p>Mr. Macron, who had first laid out his ambitious plans for Europe last September in a rousing speech of 100 minutes at the Sorbonne, needed movement on his eurozone budget proposal from the German chancellor that he could sell at home.</p>

<p>Ms. Merkel, in turn, needed support for fixing Europe’s fractured asylum and migration policies.</p>

<p>“The Europe that we know is too slow, too weak, too ineffective,” Mr. Macron said in September, before reeling off a list of ambitious proposals.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Mr. Macron did not get nearly as much as he hoped for. He had lobbied for a budget of hundreds of millions of euros to be overseen by a European finance minister. German officials, long suspicious of anything that smacks of a transfer union, agreed finally to the idea of a eurozone budget, but in the tens of millions of euros and overseen by the European Commission.</p>

<p>But Germany did agree to a proposal to coordinate its corporate tax rate with France and to an overhaul of the European Stability Mechanism, the eurozone’s bailout fund, which would expand its mission and allow it to provide emergency loans to countries in recession.</p>

<p>On balance, Mr. Macron probably got a little more than he had expected, given Ms. Merkel’s current political predicament.</p>

<p>“The domestic pressure Chancellor Merkel is currently under makes it easier for the French President to get more money for the new budget,” said Thomas Jäger, a professor at the University of Cologne.</p>

<p>If she is unable to reach agreements with other European countries within about two weeks, her interior minister, Horst Seehofer, has threatened to act unilaterally, turning back any migrant to Bavaria whose asylum process is pending in another European Union country.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, analysts said, the leaders’ joint declaration, which also covered support for closer military cooperation and foreign policy, was more substantive than might have been expected.</p>

<p>The agreement “is an important step in the right direction,” said Marcel Fratzscher, head of the German Institute for Economic Research, though he added that it would not be sufficient to make the eurozone sustainable and to avoid future crises.</p>

<p>Timothy Garton Ash of Oxford University concurred. “In time-honored fashion they will try to cobble something together that looks like a major joint initiative,” he said. “The question is: Is it enough for Europe?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” he added.</p>

<p>On migration, the current crisis appears to have focused minds.</p>

<p>“The topic that worries us all at the moment is migration,” Ms. Merkel said, standing beside Mr. Macron at a lengthy joint news conference after their meeting.</p>

<p>Both Ms. Merkel and Mr. Macron hope to fashion deals with the front-line countries receiving the most migrants, like Italy or Spain, similar to one reached with Turkey.</p>

<p>They also want to create a larger and more efficient European border force, adding 10,000 officers, and hope to discuss ways of processing asylum claims in North Africa, notably Libya, before migrants can arrive in Europe. Once migrants are on the Continent, it has proved very difficult to send back those who do not qualify as refugees, especially since many destroy their documents at sea.</p>

<p>Following a tumultuous few days, with President Trump joining the fray in Europe by firing off hostile tweets and banding together with nativists from Hungary to Slovenia, Ms. Merkel’s meeting with Mr. Macron felt at times like a defiant counter summit — an attempt by Europe’s two main centrist leaders to close ranks.</p>

<p>Mr. Macron, who has emerged as Europe’s most energetic leader, has made an urgent case for a liberal Europe. On Tuesday his government’s spokesman responded sharply to President Trump’s tweets by criticizing American policies toward migrants.</p>

<p>“President Donald Trump’s policy of separating migrants entering the U.S. from Mexico from their children shows that the United States and Europe do not share the same ‘model of civilization,’” said the spokesman, Benjamin Griveaux.</p>

<p>“I don’t want what’s happening in the United States to happen in Europe,” he told France 2 television, adding that “clearly we do not share certain values.”</p>

<p>The main responsibility of this generation, he said, “is to defend European solidarity against populism, against all forms of populism, the far left and the far right.”</p>

<p>“If everyone retreats behind their national borders, we won’t succeed,” he said.</p>

<p>The question is how much support Mr. Macron and Ms. Merkel command elsewhere in Europe for their proposed reforms of the eurozone and migration. Some nations, including Austria and the Netherlands, do not favor a separate eurozone budget, while Italy, with a new populist government, has vowed to get tough on migration.</p>

<p>“In that sense,” Mr. Jäger said, “this compromise will be a litmus test of whether the French-German engine can still pull the European train.”</p>

<h2 id="protestersflocktolaguardiatosupportimmigrantchildren">Protesters Flock to La Guardia to Support Immigrant Children</h2>

<p>Protesters gathered overnight outside La Guardia Airport in New York on the belief that migrant children taken from their parents at the border were arriving on flights from Texas.</p>

<p>Immigration activists shuttled from terminal to terminal at La Guardia Airport in New York late Wednesday night, after news spread on social media that children who had been separated from their parents at the United States-Mexico border might be arriving on flights.</p>

<p>Hours earlier, President Trump had signed an executive order saying that the policy of separating immigrant children and parents would stop, but in New York hundreds of children had already arrived to be placed in shelters or foster care.</p>

<p>The protesters held signs at security gates that read “Bienvenidos a New York,” and “Te amamos.” And they sang protest songs like “We Shall Overcome,” in English and Spanish, that reverberated through the otherwise largely empty airport.</p>

<p>Groups like Make the Road New York, an immigrant activist group, posted calls to action on Twitter, and as the night continued, the numbers swelled.</p>

<p>Outside Terminal B — not long after a group of seven boys was spotted getting off American Airlines Flight 2716, wearing dark hoodies and carrying government-labeled belongings — a circle of about 200 protesters gathered along the taxi line to plan for how they might lend support to other children getting off planes, though there was no way to determine immediately which might have been separated from their parents.</p>

<p>An American Airlines spokesman, Ross Feinstein, said in an interview that it had delayed the flight from Dallas-Fort Worth by 33 minutes until it got reassurances from government officials that these teenagers were not among those who had been separated from their parents. But a cluster of flight attendants who had been on board stood nearby after the children deplaned, visibly distraught. “They lied to us,” one flight attendant said.</p>

<p>Brian Marriott, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency was looking into the matter at La Guardia.</p>

<p>How Trump’s Policy Change Separated Migrant Children From Their Parents</p>

<p>The steps taken once families are apprehended by agents at the United States-Mexico border, and how adults and children are processed differently.</p>

<p>June 20, 2018</p>

<p>In many ways, the airport gathering was reminiscent of the protests touched off last year by Mr. Trump’s initial executive order banning travel to the United States by residents of a group of mostly Muslim countries. In the crowd on Wednesday night, the Muslim activist Linda Sarsour and New York City Council members Jumaane D. Williams and Jimmy Van Bramer stood alongside speakers.</p>

<p>Leading an impassioned chant, Cristina Jiménez, the executive director of United We Dream, a youth-led activist group, told the crowd that she had been told that a crew member on one of the flights tried to communicate with an unaccompanied minor by writing on a piece of paper. “‘What are your names? What are your parents’ names?’” she recounted.</p>

<p>“We are here to say that we’re not going to stand for the criminalization of immigrants in this country,” Ms. Jiménez continued. “That the act of coming to this country to seek refuge is not a crime.”</p>

<p>After midnight, protesters gathered outside a gate in Terminal C to greet a final Delta Air Lines flight arriving from Houston. But police officials shuttered the security gates around 2 a.m., with no separated children in sight.</p>

<h2 id="howapastorandapopcornshopownerhelpedsaveprideinstarkville">How a Pastor and a Popcorn Shop Owner Helped Save Pride in Starkville</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Heather Murphy</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/pride-starkville-mississippi.html </p>

<p>More than 2,500 people attended in the first Pride parade in Starkville, Miss., on March 24.</p>

<p>On Sunday, more than 40,000 people are expected to march through the streets of New York City for the Pride parade. That’s equivalent to every single resident of Ithaca, N.Y., plus 10,000 friends.</p>

<p>Several hundred thousand more are expected to stand cheering on the sidelines, while a small — but not insignificant — group of L.G.B.T.Q. New Yorkers are expected to stay home and maybe take a nap. Or maybe they’ll head off to the beach.</p>

<p>They will be participating in the time-honored L.G.B.T.Q. tradition of never quite making it there. (This tradition is sometimes accompanied by a comment about the individual’s discomfort with crowds or a criticism of the “corporate vibe.”)</p>

<p>I tried to explain this the other day to Bailey McDaniel, 22, a woman who had spent more than a year battling to bring Pride to her town, Starkville, Miss.</p>

<p>She thought I was joking.</p>

<p>Our conversation went roughly like this: Bud Light and Target really sponsor Pride in New York City? Yes, they do. There are queer people who resent this? Yes.</p>

<p>“It’s just too wild to imagine,” said Ms. McDaniel, who was president of the L.G.B.T.Q.+ Union at Mississippi State University in Starkville until she graduated in May.</p>

<p>“One day I want to be in a place where you boycott Pride ’cause it’s too corporate.”</p>

<p>From left, the Rev. Bert Montgomery, Rosa Dalomba and Bailey McDaniel this month on Main Street in Starkville, Miss.</p>

<p>The idea that being an L.G.B.T.Q. person in one part of the country is different from being an L.G.B.T.Q. person in another part of the country is not new. But there is something about the nature of the contrasts in this moment that feels different to many people.</p>

<p>“We’re moving toward a time of emotional, ethical and psychological confusion where there are so many things contradicting one another and going up against one another,” said Michael Bronski, a Harvard professor and the author of “A Queer History of the United States.”</p>

<p>“We can watch RuPaul on TV, but look what the Supreme Court just did,” he added, referring to the court’s 7-2 decision in favor of a Colorado baker who had refused to create a wedding cake for a gay couple.</p>

<p>In acknowledgment of this unusual time, we zoom in on five particularly contradiction-filled weeks.</p>

<p>This is the story of pride in Starkville and how over the course of a little more than a month in February and March, the city of roughly 25,000 people went from denying an event permit, because of religious concerns, to hosting a Pride parade that attracted more than 2,500 people and featured multiple religious leaders.</p>

<p>It’s also the story of how queer love and life may differ strikingly from one mile to the next — or one hour to the next. And how a few days after an openly transgender woman presented for the first time at the Oscars, a judge ruled that pushing an African-American transgender woman into a river, where she died, was not criminal conduct.</p>

<p>Week 1</p>

<p>On Feb. 20, as part of the N.H.L.’s Hockey Is for Everyone efforts, the Vancouver Canucks posted a photo of a hockey stick covered with rainbow tape on Instagram. In a typically nasty comment, a fan urged the team to delete the image, “before I burn every Canucks jersey I have.”</p>

<p>On the Mississippi coast, a transgender woman who had retired from the Air Force and was working as a broadcast engineer, opened her email to find … perfectly pleasant emails from colleagues and family, as she had every week since becoming Molly Kester four years earlier. </p>

<p>The Starkville Board of Aldermen meeting on that same day was unusually packed. After comments on a clogged sewer system, Ms. McDaniel stepped to the podium and made her case for why she should be granted a permit for the city’s first Pride parade, which she hoped to hold on March 24, strategically timed between spring break and finals.</p>

<p>She told them how she had grown the L.G.B.T.Q. group at Mississippi State University from just five people sitting in the library four years earlier to 135 and emphasized how the festivities would bring the community together.</p>

<p>What she didn’t tell them was that she and her friends were accustomed to being greeted with “Oh, it’s the dykes,” when they walked into bars; that someone threw a can at her professor when he walked down the street holding hands with his husband; that a repairman left a swastika on the wall of a local drag queen’s house.</p>

<p>As other organizers followed, with their own carefully crafted, generally upbeat speeches, Rosa Dalomba, 29, the owner of a local popcorn store, found herself moved and disturbed. Why did these residents have to beg for a permit in 2018? She eyed the lectern.</p>

<p>“I’m having a convo with myself and telling myself, ‘Dalomba — stay,’ ” she recalled, thinking about her own struggles as a black business owner on Main Street.</p>

<p>Ms. Dalomba, born in the Cape Verde islands in West Africa, had recently moved to Starkville with her boyfriend, a grad student, after a long stint in Rhode Island and several Southern locations.</p>

<p>The night President Trump was elected, she had been startled by shouts of “white power” in Monroe, La. Did she really want to draw attention to herself?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>“For a business owner, it’s foolish not to have Pride ’cause it brings business downtown,” she said when she stood at the lectern. “I’m already planning a rainbow popcorn.”</p>

<p>She was followed by a woman who told the room, “God made Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve,” and several others who also objected on religious grounds.</p>

<p>Mayor Lynn Spruill, 65, who supported the effort, was not concerned. A “perfectly happily single” woman, and the first female aviator to qualify to land on a Navy aircraft carrier, her own experience had taught her that Mississippi is more open-minded than most outsiders realize.</p>

<p>Throughout her life, she said in an interview, she has had good relationships with men and women and has never felt the need to identify as anything in particular. It was frustrating when opponents occasionally alluded to her sexuality while discussing city matters, where she felt it was irrelevant.</p>

<p>But she could not imagine even those who didn’t approve refusing to let people assemble.</p>

<p>A show of hands of those in the room revealed that the majority supported the parade. Nonetheless the aldermen voted, 4 to 3, to deny the permit.</p>

<p>Week 2</p>

<p>A New York federal appeals court on Feb. 26 ruled on behalf of a man who had been fired from his job for being gay. </p>

<p>News spread that in Georgia, the State Senate had approved a bill that would give adoption agencies the ability to refuse on religious grounds to work with L.G.B.T.Q. couples. </p>

<p>Starkville’s denial of Pride had spread quickly across the internet. The town had become national news, a symbol of backward thinking that persisted in the South. This framing felt icky to some residents.</p>

<p>At church the Sunday after the aldermen voted to deny pride, the Rev. Bert Montgomery made sure his congregation knew that he supported Ms. McDaniel, the Pride organizer, a longtime attendee of his Baptist church.</p>

<p>“Our faith calls for acceptance and affirmation, not for denial and for power,” he said in an interview. “On the one hand there has been this tradition of a rigid, narrow, fundamentalist restrictive version of Christianity, defending slavery and segregation and the oppression and submissiveness of women. But on the other hand it was rich Christian tradition that was leading the abolitionists’ movement and the civil rights movement.”</p>

<p>Organizers were touched to hear that pastors at other churches had also been emphasizing messages of love and acceptance.</p>

<p>Ms. McDaniel — who was being trailed by a crew from Vice News and taking calls from “everyone and their mother” — was too busy to go to class. The day after the denial, the Campaign for Southern Equality had called, connecting her and her co-organizer, Emily Turner, to Roberta Kaplan, the lawyer who helped win the battle at the Supreme Court in 2013 to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act. They filed a lawsuit against Starkville.</p>

<p>The response around town was better than they were expecting.</p>

<p>Every day, it seemed, a rainbow flag appeared in the window of a local business. Someone told them the owner of the Pop Porium was offering to host Pride at her shop if the permit didn’t come through.</p>

<p>Week 3</p>

<p>Daniela Vega became the first transgender person to present at the Academy Awards. “Gives me hope that trans women will begin to be acknowledged for our skills across industries,” wrote a woman on Twitter. Trans activists began organizing a response to a judge’s ruling that the actions of a man who “inadvertently” pushed an African-American transgender woman into a river, where she drowned, did not rise to the level of criminal conduct. “Her name was Kenne McFadden. Her life mattered. She was killed and she will receive no justice. That is why I say #BlackLivesMatter that is why I say #translivesmatter,” wrote a man on Twitter.</p>

<p>On March 6, Starkville’s Board of Aldermen voted again. This time, Alderman David Little, who had previously voted against the permit, abstained, knowing it would allow the mayor to break the tie.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, which would be settled, was no longer necessary. Pride was on.</p>

<p>Mr. Little did not respond to an interview request, but Lillian Faderman, an L.G.B.T.Q. historian, considers him one of the most interesting characters in this.</p>

<p>He is the person who saw how the country — and his community — reacted, and he changed his mind.</p>

<p>“That suggests to me we’re making progress somehow,” she said.</p>

<p>Week 4</p>

<p>A writer in Los Angeles, who married and divorced her wife in the course of a year, found herself wondering why her super woke queer friends, with their fiery support of the #MeToo movement, seemed unable to believe that a woman could also be an abuser. </p>

<p>Residents of Starkville started hearing reports that quite a lot of people might be coming to the parade from far beyond their city.</p>

<p>Week 5</p>

<p>A Utah newspaper published a letter by a woman lamenting the fact that a rainbow flag was stolen off her family’s deck. “We are on our third flag,” Ginger Lockhart told me in an email. In Tucson, a woman cried tears of joy as the audience cheered wildly for two boys making out — in the movie “Love, Simon.” “I never thought we would be in a place where young folks cheer for two guys just like I cheered when Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger finally got together in ‘10 Things I Hate About You’ back in 1998,” Jennifer Nguyen wrote to me. </p>

<p>No one knew quite what to expect on March 24, the day of Starkville’s Pride parade. The mayor had been fielding concerns that it would just be a sea of naked people, performing lewd acts. But the streets were mostly filled with joyful children and their parents, many carrying picnic baskets.</p>

<p>As Ms. McDaniel walked around, she realized that for five full blocks all she could see was people. They began with a goal of 150. They ended up with around 2,500.</p>

<p>“That brought me to my knees,” she said.</p>

<p>A number of protesters with signs mentioning God and sin could be spotted shouting at the side. They appeared to be a much smaller group than the 75 or so people representing various religious institutions who walked alongside Mr. Montgomery and a rabbi, observed Antonio Tarrell, a filmmaker documenting the parade.,</p>

<p>Ms. Dalomba found herself choking up as she sambaed past her popcorn shop. In the end, her decision to fight for Pride had brought her a stream of new customers and friends.</p>

<p>“For a long time I truly believed that someone like me could not live in the South,” she said. “That day gave me hope.”</p>

<p>For Ms. McDaniel, it was hard to pick a favorite moment. There was the encounter with the man, so tall and joyful that he reminded her of the Jolly Green Giant, who told her, “I think this is the happiest moment in all the 70 years I’ve been alive.”</p>

<p>That got her.</p>

<p>There was seeing her boss from work who she had no idea was “accepting.” That got her, too.</p>

<p>But really, probably, it was the parents. So many parents — straight and gay — all hugging her.</p>

<p>“Thank you for letting our child experience it,” one told her, “because this is everything we want them to fight for — but they didn’t have anything to fight for before because nothing happens here.”</p>

<p>Groups like Make the Road New York, an immigrant activist group, posted calls to action on Twitter, and as the night continued, the numbers swelled.</p>

<p>Outside Terminal B — not long after a group of seven boys was spotted getting off American Airlines Flight 2716, wearing dark hoodies and carrying government-labeled belongings — a circle of about 200 protesters gathered along the taxi line to plan for how they might lend support to other children getting off planes, though there was no way to determine immediately which might have been separated from their parents.</p>

<p>An American Airlines spokesman, Ross Feinstein, said in an interview that it had delayed the flight from Dallas-Fort Worth by 33 minutes until it got reassurances from government officials that these teenagers were not among those who had been separated from their parents. But a cluster of flight attendants who had been on board stood nearby after the children deplaned, visibly distraught. “They lied to us,” one flight attendant said.</p>

<p>Brian Marriott, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, a division of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency was looking into the matter at La Guardia.</p>

<p>How Trump’s Policy Change Separated Migrant Children From Their Parents</p>

<p>The steps taken once families are apprehended by agents at the United States-Mexico border, and how adults and children are processed differently.</p>

<p>June 20, 2018</p>

<p>In many ways, the airport gathering was reminiscent of the protests touched off last year by Mr. Trump’s initial executive order banning travel to the United States by residents of a group of mostly Muslim countries. In the crowd on Wednesday night, the Muslim activist Linda Sarsour and New York City Council members Jumaane D. Williams and Jimmy Van Bramer stood alongside speakers.</p>

<p>Leading an impassioned chant, Cristina Jiménez, the executive director of United We Dream, a youth-led activist group, told the crowd that she had been told that a crew member on one of the flights tried to communicate with an unaccompanied minor by writing on a piece of paper. “‘What are your names? What are your parents’ names?’” she recounted.</p>

<p>“We are here to say that we’re not going to stand for the criminalization of immigrants in this country,” Ms. Jiménez continued. “That the act of coming to this country to seek refuge is not a crime.”</p>

<p>After midnight, protesters gathered outside a gate in Terminal C to greet a final Delta Air Lines flight arriving from Houston. But police officials shuttered the security gates around 2 a.m., with no separated children in sight.</p>

<h2 id="policekillingshaveharmedmentalhealthinblackcommunitiesstudyfinds">Police Killings Have Harmed Mental Health in Black Communities, Study Finds</h2>

<p id="byline">by: John Eligon</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/police-shootings-black-mental-health.html </p>

<p>A protester with a portrait of Stephon Clark at a demonstration in Sacramento in March after Mr. Clark, who was unarmed, was shot and killed by the police there.</p>

<p>Activists for racial justice have long expressed concern that the rash of headline-grabbing police killings of black Americans was damaging the mental well-being of African-American communities.</p>

<p>A report published in The Lancet, a leading British medical journal, on Thursday appears to give credence to those concerns.</p>

<p>Using mental health survey data and a database of police shootings, a team of health researchers concluded that when police officers in the United States kill unarmed black people, it damages the mental health of black Americans living in those states.</p>

<p>The mental health of white Americans was not similarly affected, the researchers found. Nor were negative health effects associated with police killings of unarmed white Americans or armed black Americans.</p>

<p>While these findings might seem unsurprising, particularly to African-Americans, the researchers contended that their study was a significant attempt to assess the measurable, if indirect, harms that police violence has inflicted on the broader psychological and emotional well-being of African-Americans.</p>

<p>“‘Having seen something so horrific and traumatic that happened to someone else, I’m reminded in a very painful and salient way that the deck might be stacked against me,’” Atheendar S. Venkataramani, one of the study’s authors, said of how black people might perceive police killings. “It’s really about all the kinds of insidious ways that structural racism can make people sick.”</p>

<p>Have You Been Affected by Police Shootings of Unarmed Black Civilians?</p>

<p>Have you been personally affected, emotionally or psychologically, by police shootings of unarmed black civilians? We would like to hear from you.</p>

<p>Please fill out the form below. A reporter or editor may contact you to hear more about your story.</p>

<p>Required fields are marked with an asterisk.</p>

<p>Describe the shooting and how you found about it. *</p>

<p>Continue </p>

<p>Dr. Venkataramani, an assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania, conducted the study along with Jacob Bor of Boston University, David R. Williams of Harvard and Alexander C. Tsai of Massachusetts General Hospital.</p>

<p>The researchers analyzed responses from 2013 to 2016 to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a national survey that interviews more than 400,000 adults, selected at random each year, about their health. They juxtaposed responses to questions regarding mental health with data from Mapping Police Violence, a database of police killings around the country.</p>

<p>The annual health survey is done by telephone on a rolling basis throughout the year, and the researchers analyzed responses given by residents in states where a police killing had occurred in the three months before they were interviewed. They found that black Americans reported more “not good” mental health days in the period after a police killing of an unarmed black person, and that the killings accounted for up to 1.7 additional days of poor mental health a year.</p>

<p>The study’s authors could not say definitively that the respondents to the health survey knew about the police killings that had happened in their states, or describe how, precisely, the news about the killings might have harmed their mental health.</p>

<p>Still, Dr. Venkataramani said the effects were observable and real. If anything, he said, the findings might understate the extent of the trauma, as some police killings of unarmed African-Americans have become events of national significance, reaching far beyond the states where they occurred. (The study cited, among the most notable examples, the police killings of Oscar Grant III in California, in 2009; of Michael Brown Jr. in Missouri and Eric Garner in New York, in 2014; of Walter Scott in South Carolina and Freddie Gray in Maryland, in 2015; and of Stephon Clark in California, earlier this year.)</p>

<p>“Maybe this is the tip of the iceberg,” Dr. Venkataramani said.</p>

<p>While a study like this one helps to underscore the impact of police killings on black communities, what’s important is what is done with the findings, said Mama Ayanna Mashama, an activist and organizer in Oakland, Calif., who practices natural wellness healing. Ms. Mashama said she had seen firsthand how police violence can cause anger and angst, and damage the self-esteem of black Americans.</p>

<p>“We have to find ways of de-escalating police response to black people,” she said. “It has to become policy. It has to become part of how it’s implemented from the top down. We have to have trauma-informed practices everywhere: in the schools, in families, in workplaces.”</p>

<h2 id="firststeptohelpingchildrensenttonewyorkfindthem">First Step to Helping Children Sent to New York: Find Them</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/nyregion/children-separated-border-new-york.html </p>

<p>Mayor Bill De Blasio at the Cayuga Centers in Harlem on Wednesday said that 350 children had come through the center and that 239 of them were currently in Cayuga’s care.</p>

<p>As reports came in of hundreds of children sent quietly to New York after being separated from their families at the southern border, consular officials from Central American countries scrambled to help.</p>

<p>Overnight, their jobs had changed from processing passports and visas from their offices in Midtown Manhattan and on Park Avenue to providing emergency humanitarian aid to children taken from their parents under a Trump Administration policy.</p>

<p>But the first step was finding them.</p>

<p>That process was thrown into more disarray on Wednesday when President Trump signed an executive order ending the policy that separated children from their parents. It appeared that children were continuing to arrive in New York as late as Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Consular offices are often involved in cases of unaccompanied migrant youth, especially when children want to return to their countries voluntarily. But this situation was “atypical,” according to José Vicente Chinchilla, the consul general of El Salvador, because they did not even know children separated from their families were coming to New York, let alone how many.</p>

<p>“To be honest, I don’t have a number,” he said on Wednesday, noting that the federal authorities had not responded to requests for information. “For the moment,” Mr. Chinchilla said, “there has been no contact.”</p>

<p>The federal agency that cares for unaccompanied minors — the Office of Refugee Resettlement — had not informed consular officials in New York of any shift in policy before news broke on Wednesday that more than 300 children had been sent to New York.</p>

<p>The mayor’s office also had been kept in the dark. “We have asked directly for an estimation of children who have been separated in the city; we have not received a response,” said Bitta Mostofi, the commissioner of Immigrant Affairs for New York. “Kids are being sent across the country and this has not been part of what they have publicly disclosed,” she said.</p>

<p>She said the mayor’s office was deeply troubled by the lack of transparency from the federal government.</p>

<p>The resettlement agency also could not provide the number of children separated from their parents who have been sent to New York.</p>

<p>“It is still very early and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter,” said Brian Marriott, a senior director of communications at the federal Administration for Children and Families. He said the agency’s focus is on continuing to provide quality services and care to the minors.</p>

<p>By Thursday, consular officials and others were shifting into crisis mode, beginning to search for children as young as 9 months old who did not appear to have been carefully tracked by the federal authorities.</p>

<p>The consul of Honduras, Lídice González, had sent a list of questions on Wednesday to a local representative of the resettlement agency: “Where are they? In what centers? What are their names? How old are they?” Ms. González said. “I sent her an email and marked it ‘urgent.’”</p>

<p>“She said she was visiting the shelters,” she said of the representative, whom she did not name. Ms. González said she had been promised a list.</p>

<p>The majority of children sent to New York are believed to have been taken at the border after traveling north with their relatives from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where countless families have fled poverty and gang violence.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, city officials announced that children had been sent to New York over the last two months and were placed with social service agencies that have contracts with the federal government.</p>

<p>City officials first learned that children were being sent to New York after a relative of a Honduran child asked a friend to contact Mayor Bill de Blasio. At first, it seemed he was one of dozens. Speaking on Wednesday afternoon outside Cayuga Centers in Harlem, Mr. de Blasio said 350 children had passed through the center; 239 of them were still in Cayuga’s care. (The agency places children in temporary foster care; it is not a residential facility.)</p>

<p>On Thursday, consular officials switched gears. Mr. Chinchilla and his staff were contacting the social service agencies to try to find the children.</p>

<p>“We will go talk to them,” he said. “We will be looking at providing legal representation, but also at their health and how they’re doing psychologically.”</p>

<p>And then they would start searching for their families. His office was contacting government offices stretching back to San Salvador, the capital, in search of relatives who may have reported a separated child.</p>

<p>They hadn’t received any calls, but expected to be flooded.</p>

<h2 id="uspreparestohouseupto20000migrantsonmilitarybases">U.S. Prepares to House Up to 20,000 Migrants on Military Bases</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/politics/trump-immigration-border-family-separation.html </p>

<p>WASHINGTON — The United States is preparing to shelter as many as 20,000 migrant children on four American military bases, a Pentagon spokesman said on Thursday, as federal officials struggled to carry out President Trump’s order to keep immigrant families together after they are apprehended at the border.</p>

<p>The 20,000 beds at bases in Texas and Arkansas would house “unaccompanied alien children,” said a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Michael Andrews, although other federal agencies provided conflicting explanations about how the shelters would be used and who would be housed there. There were reports of widespread confusion on the border.</p>

<p>It was unclear whether the military housing would also house the parents of children in migrant families that have been detained, and officials at the White House, the Defense Department and the Department of Health and Human Services said on Thursday that they could not provide details.</p>

<p>The Pentagon announcement followed Mr. Trump’s executive order on Wednesday to keep families together after they illegally cross the Mexican border into the United States. The order called for detaining families at the same location.</p>

<p>Democrats questioned the 20,000-bed plan. “Is it even feasible?” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, asked from the Senate floor.</p>

<p>Advocates for the migrants expressed concern about the prospect of vast settlements of families housed on military bases.</p>

<p>“There’s conflicting instructions being given,” said Michelle Brané, the director of Migrant Rights and Justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission. “It’s another example of this administration making these big, bold policy announcements with no plan for how they are going to implement them.”</p>

<p>“It’s adding to the chaos on the ground,” she said. The tumult echoed the level of confusion among law enforcement agencies at airports after Mr. Trump barred travel for visitors from predominantly Muslim countries a week after he took office last year.</p>

<p>The president’s order this week directed Pentagon officials to provide “any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families” and to “construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law.”</p>

<p>Defense Secretary Jim Mattis sidestepped questions on Wednesday about whether bases might be used as migrant camps, except to say: “We have housed refugees. We have housed people thrown out of their homes by earthquakes and hurricanes.”</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Pentagon did not say which bases would be used for the shelters.</p>

<p>According to estimates, more than 2,300 children under 12 — many of whom are toddlers and infants — are being held in special “tender age” shelters.</p>

<p>A Trump administration spokesman said on Wednesday afternoon that the government would not immediately reunite those children with their parents. But that was contradicted Wednesday night by a more senior official.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Justice Department officials denied a report, apparently issued by officials from another agency, that prosecutions of immigrants traveling with families had been suspended.</p>

<p>Scrambling to adjust and comply with the president’s order, the Border Patrol temporarily stopped referring immigration cases to the Justice Department for prosecution, setting off rumors that it would be halted altogether.</p>

<p>That forced the Justice Department to insist in a statement that “there has been no change to the department’s ‘zero tolerance’ policy to prosecute adults who cross our border illegally instead of claiming asylum at any port of entry at the border.”</p>

<p>Two internal Customs and Border Protection emails supplied to The New York Times showed similar confusion.</p>

<p>In one, sent at 9:54 p.m. Wednesday, Chief Patrol Agent Brian Hastings of the Border Patrol told supervisors that they could continue prosecution referrals for one parent who entered the country illegally if there was another adult migrant present.</p>

<p>But at 4:09 a.m. Thursday, he followed up, saying that agents should “maintain family unity for multi-parent/adult families.”</p>

<p>Last week, federal officials opened a tent city outside El Paso to house up to 360 immigrant teenagers in custody. The temporary shelter site, at a border station in Tornillo, Tex., was still in use on Thursday, and its capacity remains 360, officials said.</p>

<p>In the border city of Del Rio, Tex., American officials continued deporting undocumented immigrants. Luis Alexis Morales, 20, of Veracruz State in eastern Mexico, said he was left in the middle of a bridge that links Del Rio with Ciudad Acuña, Mexico.</p>

<p>“The Border Patrol caught me a week ago crossing the river near Piedras Negras,” Mr. Morales said, referring to a city in northern Mexico across from Eagle Pass, Tex. He said American authorities had held him in jail for the past seven days before deporting him.</p>

<p>On the legal front, Mr. Trump’s lawyers asked Judge Dolly M. Gee of Federal District Court in Los Angeles to modify a 1997 court ruling to allow the indefinite detention of families.</p>

<p>The ruling, known as the Flores settlement, requires that children must be released within 20 days. After that, they are to be sent to a family member or placed in the custody of a licensed, government-sponsored shelter.</p>

<p>The Justice Department said the only way to prevent migrant children from being separated from their parents would be to detain entire families. It seemed to suggest that the practice of separating families could resume if the judge refused to alter the 1997 ruling.</p>

<p>It also echoed a 2016 argument by the Obama administration during a similar migrant surge. The judge and an appeals court denied the requests by the administration’s lawyers.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Obama administration briefly sheltered migrant children at military bases in Texas, California and Oklahoma, establishing emergency housing for a steep increase in unaccompanied minors crossing the border. Around 7,000 children were housed on the bases for about three months until the number of migrants ebbed.</p>

<p>At the time, officials said the government was responding to a rise in the number of unaccompanied children fleeing violence in Central America. The military’s role then was limited to housing the migrants and giving officials from the Department of Health and Human Services access to bases.</p>

<p>It was unclear on Thursday whether the military would play a more central role in Mr. Trump’s plan.</p>

<p>At the White House, the president again lashed out at “extremist, open-border Democrats,” and he again falsely blamed Democrats for the political crisis that continues to roil his administration and was amplified in recent days by images and recordings of young children crying for their parents.</p>

<p>Choosing hard-edge remarks at a cabinet meeting before the House was scheduled to vote on overhauling immigration laws, Mr. Trump asked for Democratic lawmakers’ support on the legislation, even as he said they were causing “tremendous damage and destruction and lives.”</p>

<p>He repeated his false claim that Democrats forced family separations. “They don’t care about the children. They don’t care about the injury. They don’t care about the problems,” Mr. Trump said. “They don’t care about anything.”</p>

<p>In a stream-of-consciousness commentary, the president also attacked Mexico for what he claimed was a failure to help stop illegal immigration into the United States. He said the trek through Mexico from Central America was like a walk through Central Park.</p>

<p>“Mexico is doing nothing for us except taking our money and giving us drugs,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump said he has directed his administration to “keep illegal immigrant families together and to reunite these previously separated groups.” But he offered no details about how the government intends to reunite the families.</p>

<p>Melania Trump, the first lady, visited a facility in McAllen, Tex., that is holding 55 children who have been separated from their parents.</p>

<p>She took a tour of the Upbring New Hope Children’s Shelter, and in one classroom, she met with a group of children, some of whom spoke to her in English and others in Spanish, which was translated by a teacher.</p>

<p>Officials at the shelter said that the children held there were allowed to communicate with their families by phone twice a week.</p>

<p>“How long are you here? Where are you from?” asked Mrs. Trump, who traveled with Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary. As she left, she said, “Be kind and nice to others, O.K.? Nice to meet you.”</p>

<p>Back in Washington, House lawmakers had been scheduled to vote on Thursday on two broad immigration proposals, even as Mr. Trump’s executive order relieved some of the pressure to act quickly.</p>

<p>The House rejected a hard-line immigration bill in a vote on Thursday afternoon, as had been expected. And Republican leaders delayed the vote on the second bill, which would provide a path to citizenship for young unauthorized immigrants while keeping migrant families together at the border.</p>

<p>That bill, a compromise between moderate and conservative Republicans, had been set for a vote early Thursday evening, but the vote will now take place next week, as it appeared destined to fail as Republicans remained at odds over immigration.</p>

<p>As Mr. Trump reiterated on Thursday his position that congressional action would be the best way to resolve the border crisis, critics of the president announced that they would not wait for such a measure.</p>

<p>A coalition of 10 states filed a lawsuit aimed at making sure that the Trump administration stops separating children from their parents at the border.</p>

<p>“President Trump yesterday signed an empty and meaningless order that claims to take back policies that he put in place himself as a political stunt,” said Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, who is a plaintiff in the suit. “Meanwhile, these children, their parents and people around the world need answers regarding what comes next.”</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union has already filed a separate lawsuit that demands the government stop separating families and reunite the children who have already been separated with the parents who brought them into the United States.</p>

<h2 id="migrantparentswaitandhopefortheirchildrenifeellikeimgoingtodie">Migrant Parents Wait and Hope for Their Children: ‘I Feel Like I’m Going to Die’</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Jack Healy</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/immigrant-children-separating-families.html </p>

<p>Asylum seekers waited outside the port of entry in Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday.</p>

<p>AURORA, Colo. — Micaela Samol Gonzalez, dressed in blue detention scrubs, made her way to the front of a windowless courtroom in Colorado on Thursday and faced the judge. After she gave her name and arranged a future court date for her immigration case, the judge asked whether she had any questions.</p>

<p>She had just one.</p>

<p>“My question is regarding my son,” Ms. Gonzalez, whose boy was taken away by immigration authorities shortly after she was accused of crossing the border illegally on a journey from Guatemala, said in Spanish. “I’ve been given a number to contact him but nobody’s replying to me, and I’m wondering if he’s doing well.”</p>

<p>A day after President Trump signed an executive order scrapping his administration’s practice of separating immigrant parents and children at the border, there was no relief for Ms. Gonzalez and hundreds of other parents who were little closer to reuniting with the more than 2,300 children who have been taken from them under the administration’s “zero tolerance” border enforcement policy.</p>

<p>Parents said they still did not know how to track down their children, and struggled to find out any information through a 1-800 hotline set up by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement. Others who had located their children said they were still separated by thousands of miles and a bureaucratic maze they did not know how to navigate.</p>

<p>The one thing they wanted was their children. But parents and lawyers said those reunions still seemed achingly distant and uncertain.</p>

<p>Administration officials have said children were taken only from parents who had violated the law by crossing the border without proper documents. Brian Marriott, senior director of communications for the Department of Health and Human Services, said after the new executive order was signed that the agency was “working toward” reunifying families, though he could not say how quickly that would happen.</p>

<p>As Ms. Gonzalez listened to the judge over a pair of translation headphones, a court officer gave her a photocopied fact sheet titled, in Spanish, “Are you detained and separated from your children?” She said she had not seen her son since May 25, when they were separated at the border. She thought he was in New York. She knew nothing for sure.</p>

<p>“I called but nobody answered,” she said. “I tried before. I will keep trying.”</p>

<p>Even outside the walls of a detention facility, some parents could only guess when they would see their children again.</p>

<p>Angelica, a 31-year-old asylum applicant from Guatemala who feared repercussions if she disclosed her last name, said she had not seen her 8-year-old daughter since the two were separated at an immigration detention facility in Arizona in early May. They had been apprehended by immigration officers somewhere in the desert.</p>

<p>After her arrest, Angelica was flown to Las Vegas and transferred to a detention facility in Aurora, Colo. She spent more than a month there before being released on a $1,500 bond this week. She is now staying with a friend who is helping her financially and trying to help her navigate the immigration system.</p>

<p>An ICE processing center in Aurora, Colo. President Trump signed an executive order Wednesday scrapping his administration’s practice of separating immigrant parents and children at the border.</p>

<p>On Thursday, she said she was finally able to talk to her daughter for 15 minutes and learned she was in a facility on the southern border. She did not know what city. She did not know the name of the facility.</p>

<p>All she knew, she said, was what a social worker there had told her: She would be allowed to call her daughter twice a week, on Tuesday and Thursday — “no más.” She would need to fill out lots of paperwork. She should not attempt to visit. And she should not expect to reunite with her daughter for a month. Maybe two.</p>

<p>“It feels like an eternity to know I won’t be able to see my daughter and I can’t hold her,” she said in a telephone interview, speaking through an interpreter. “I feel like I’m going to die. I feel powerless.”</p>

<p>Angelica said her daughter had been sick and sad in detention. She came down with a cough and fever. Another boy hit her and left a large bruise on her face. Recently, she got pink eye and was isolated so she would not infect other children. She feels alone, her mother said.</p>

<p>“She’s sad,” she said. “She wants to come home. She doesn’t know if she’s going to see me again. She just wants to come home with her mom.”</p>

<p>When they video-chatted on Thursday, she said that she told her daughter that she would buy her a backpack and take her to school, and that they would have a real celebration for her eighth birthday, which had passed while she was in custody.</p>

<p>She said she was determined to navigate the immigration system successfully. Her situation in Guatemala had reached the point that she felt sure that she and her daughter would be killed if they were returned.</p>

<p>“I want a chance at another life,” she said. “But I don’t want another life without my daughter.”</p>

<p>Some parents have already been deported, and are trying to phone immigration authorities from abroad for information about when and how they can recover their children.</p>

<p>Elsa Johana Ortiz Enriquez, who was deported to Guatemala without her son in early June, was despondent in a series of text messages from Guatemala City on Thursday.</p>

<p>Her son, Anthony Tobar Ortiz, 8, was taken away by the Border Patrol after they illegally entered the United States in southern Texas last month. Nearly a month later, she has no idea when she will see him again.</p>

<p>“I feel very bad because the days are passing and nothing is clear,” said Ms. Ortiz, 25. “I know nothing of Anthony.”</p>

<p>She said that during phone calls, the case manager at the facility near Houston where her son is housed has not made clear what will happen next.</p>

<p>“All I know is that no one knows what will happen with the children who were separated,” she said.</p>

<p>Across the country, immigration lawyers said they were slogging through confusion, bureaucracy and secrecy as they tried to locate children.</p>

<p>Many were tapping private social media networks to find social workers who might know their clients’ children. They were asking colleagues in other cities to search immigration court dockets for the name of a child’s parent. Some were preparing legal complaints to try to force the release of children being held by the government.</p>

<p>“No one knows what’s happening with these children,” said Laura Lunn, the managing attorney of the detention program at the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network. “There’s no concept where their child is.”</p>

<p>The group said that about 50 women who were separated from their children have arrived recently at a 1,500-person immigration detention and processing center in an industrial neighborhood east of Denver.</p>

<p>Ms. Lunn represents three Guatemalan women who were each separated from their children. One has been held for two months and has no idea where her son is. Another knows her son is in New York, but has not spoken to him. The third knows her 6-year-old son is being held in Arizona, and was able to call him on his birthday.</p>

<p>“He just said, ‘Mom why aren’t you with me?’” Ms. Lunn said, recounting their conversation. “She said, ‘Oh mi hijo, I am with you. I’m just not there right now. We’re just going to have to wait a little while longer.’”</p>

<p>Even when parents are freed from detention on bonds, as happened with Angelica, lawyers say there is no road map and scant guidance from the federal government about how to reunite with their children.</p>

<p>Astrid Lockwood, an immigration lawyer with The Federal Practice Group, flew to Denver and was able to secure a $1,500 bond to release her client, a Salvadoran woman who turned herself in to immigration officials after crossing the border in late May with her 7-year-old son.</p>

<p>The woman could be freed as early as Friday, but that is just the beginning of the saga of trying to reunite the family, Ms. Lockwood said.</p>

<p>The woman is in Denver, where she knows no one. Her family is in Maryland. And her son is being held in Miami.</p>

<p>The family only knows this much because the boy gave the authorities the phone number of his Maryland relatives. Many of the children are taught to memorize critical phone numbers and repeat them if they are detained, Ms. Lockwood said. She said she and the family are working to file paperwork that would allow the boy to be released to relatives, but said the next steps are murky and even immigration lawyers have little guidance from the government.</p>

<p>“I asked, what is the process now?” Ms. Lockwood said. “I was told to go look at a website. I jumped into a dirty pool. I have no idea what’s in the bottom, or how to get to the other side.”</p>

<p>Melania Trump, the first lady, departed Joint Base Andrews on Thursday after traveling to Texas. Her jacket reads, “I really don’t care. Do U?”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — President Trump appeared to take his battle with the news media to a new level on Thursday, apparently using the first lady’s much-covered visit with detained immigrant children in a Texas border town as an opportunity to spell out his grievances with the press.</p>

<p>As the temperature climbed to 80 degrees on Thursday at Joint Base Andrews near Washington, Melania Trump boarded her plane wearing an olive green coat that read, in white capital letters, “I really don’t care. Do U?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trump did not wear it while visiting with the children, but she did wear it upon her return to the capital, in full view of the news photographers who had gathered to capture her arrival. As the images were beamed around the world, the message was also in full view of her husband, a vociferous viewer of cable news.</p>

<p>“I REALLY DON’T CARE, DO U?” written on the back of Melania’s jacket, refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!” he wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>The first lady’s office did not back up the president’s explanation. Mrs. Trump’s spokeswoman said it was “just a jacket” — nothing to see here.</p>

<p>For the second time since her husband took office — and the second time on a trip to Texas — Mrs. Trump had made an unusual choice. It was a move reminiscent of her decision last year to wear stilettos to a hurricane relief zone, which was also the subject of much deliberation about her fashion decisions.</p>

<p>One common reaction to the jacket was bafflement: What was she thinking? No, really, what was she thinking? Mrs. Trump is a former model with a keen understanding of her own image. She rarely makes an accidental fashion choice.</p>

<p>“Fashion is not by accident with this woman,” Bob Phibbs, the chief executive of the Retail Doctor, a consultancy in New York, said in an interview. “She’s a former model. Every piece of clothing has statement and purpose. She’s all about image, and so is Trump. She knows the power.”</p>

<p>When asked about the garment — a $39 jacket from the fast-fashion brand Zara’s 2016 collection — Mrs. Trump’s office quickly responded.</p>

<p>“It’s a jacket,” the first lady’s communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said Thursday in a statement to reporters. “There was no hidden message. After today’s important visit to Texas, I hope this isn’t what the media is going to choose to focus on.”</p>

<p>(“It’s never just a jacket,” Mr. Phibbs said.)</p>

<p>Ms. Grisham followed up her statement with a tweet that reinforced what the East Wing said was an nonissue: “#ItsJustAJacket.” Asked whether her own explanation or the president’s was the truth, Ms. Grisham did not immediately respond.</p>

<p>The first lady’s appearance, which was kept secret until she touched down in Texas, came as the Trump administration, facing questions over the well-being and whereabouts of thousands of children, sought to put a more humane lens on its policies.</p>

<p>What it ultimately got was a distraction from them: On Thursday, the Pentagon was assessing how — and where — to house as many as 20,000 immigrants on American military bases.</p>

<p>During Mrs. Trump’s 75-minute visit to the Upbring New Hope Children’s Shelter in McAllen, Tex., she met with dozens of children as well as the people who are educating them and supervising their care. She asked officials questions about children’s well-being. She told the children to value friendship over all else.</p>

<p>“Good luck,” the first lady told them. The children applauded her as she left.</p>

<p>It was a striking re-emergence for Mrs. Trump, who underwent a procedure in May to treat a benign kidney condition and spent several weeks out of the public eye. Her trip on Thursday was a headfirst dive into the roiling debate over the Trump administration’s hard-line approach to immigration hours after her husband declared “we’ll send them the hell back” at a campaign rally.</p>

<p>She is the first member of the Trump family to visit the border with Mexico since a national debate broke out over the administration’s separation policy. The outcry led the president to reverse course under political pressure and sign an executive order on Wednesday to end the policy. More than 2,300 children have been separated from their parents so far, and thousands of families are likely to remain fractured.</p>

<p>“I’m here to learn about your facility,” Mrs. Trump told a group of officials at the center. She added that she wanted to offer “help to these children to reunite with their families as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>The first lady interacted with dozens of the center’s 55 children, visiting three classrooms, according to a small group of reporters who accompanied her on the trip.</p>

<p>The jacket Mrs. Trump wore was apparently from the fast-fashion brand Zara and cost $39.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trump, who recently started Be Best, a platform centered around the betterment of children’s lives, asked her aides to organize the trip after seeing photographs and video of separated families, and hearing audio of children crying in the centers, Ms. Grisham said.</p>

<p>“She’s seen the images,” Ms. Grisham told reporters. “She’s heard the recordings. She was on top of the situation before any of that came out. She was concerned about it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Trump, who traveled to Texas with Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, was also scheduled to visit the Ursula Border Patrol Processing Center, which had became a particular subject of scrutiny this week after a government video emerged showing families sitting in cages clutching mylar blankets. But her visit had to be cut short because of bad weather.</p>

<p>A senior administration official, who insisted on anonymity, told reporters on the first lady’s plane that only six of the New Hope facility’s 55 children had been separated from their parents, and the rest arrived as unaccompanied minors. At the facility, officials told the first lady that the separated children could speak to their parents twice a week.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trump also asked about the condition of the children when they arrived: “So when the children come here, what kind of stage, you know, physical and the mental stage” are they in when “they come here?”</p>

<p>She was told by an official that children often arrive distraught, but soon settle in.</p>

<p>“It’s a process, yes,” Mrs. Trump replied. “But I’ve heard they’re very happy. They love to study. They love to go school.”</p>

<p>In recent days, according to her office, Mrs. Trump was upset by news reports about families being separated at the border and helped persuade President Trump to take action to stop it. Amid the din of voices who tried to persuade him to change his mind — including members of Congress and his oldest daughter — the first lady’s concern seemed to stand out.</p>

<p>“My wife feels very strongly about it,” Mr. Trump said as he signed an executive order on Wednesday to stop the separations. But Mr. Trump, who faced a growing outcry from the public and from Republicans and Democrats in Congress, did not say whether her urging had swayed his decision.</p>

<p>In any case, Mrs. Trump had planned the trip before the president signed the order: “I don’t know what she knew” about the timing, Ms. Grisham said. “She knew what she wanted to do, and she told us.”</p>

<p>Ms. Grisham also emphasized that the first lady had her own opinions and would share them with the world — and with her husband — when warranted.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/us/migrant-shelters-border-crossing.html </p>

<p>Casa Padre, a shelter run by Southwest Key Programs, houses roughly 1,500 immigrant children in a converted Walmart Supercenter in Brownsville, Tex.</p>

<p>HARLINGEN, Tex. — The business of housing, transporting and watching over migrant children detained along the southwest border is not a multimillion-dollar business.</p>

<p>It’s a billion-dollar one.</p>

<p>The nonprofit Southwest Key Programs has won at least $955 million in federal contracts since 2015 to run shelters and provide other services to immigrant children in federal custody. Its shelter for migrant boys at a former Walmart Supercenter in South Texas has been the focus of nationwide scrutiny, but Southwest Key is but one player in the lucrative, secretive world of the migrant-shelter business. About a dozen contractors operate more than 30 facilities in Texas alone, with numerous others contracted for about 100 shelters in 16 other states.</p>

<p>If there is a migrant-shelter hub in America, then it is perhaps in the four-county Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas, where about a dozen shelters occupy former stores, schools and medical centers. They are some of the region’s biggest employers, though what happens inside is often highly confidential: One group has employees sign nondisclosure agreements, more a fixture of the high-stakes corporate world than of nonprofit child-care centers.</p>

<p>The recent separation of some 2,300 migrant children from their families under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy on illegal border crossers has thrust this invisible industry into the spotlight in recent weeks, as images of toddlers and teenagers taken from their parents and detained behind locked doors have set off a political firestorm. President Trump’s order on Wednesday calling for migrant families to be detained together likely means millions more in contracts for private shelter operators, construction companies and defense contractors.</p>

<p>A small network of private prison companies already is operating family detention centers in Texas and Pennsylvania, and those facilities are likely to expand under the new presidential directive, should it stand up to legal review, analysts said.</p>

<p>The range of contractors working in the migrant-shelter industry varies widely.</p>

<p>BCFS, a global network of nonprofit groups, has received at least $179 million in federal contracts since 2015 under the government’s so-called unaccompanied alien children program, designed to handle migrant youths who arrive in the country without a parent or other family member. Many of the contractors, some of which are religiously affiliated organizations and emergency-management agencies such as Catholic Charities, see their work as humanitarian aid to some of the most vulnerable children in the world.</p>

<p>But several large defense contractors and security firms are also building a presence in the system, including General Dynamics, the global aerospace and defense company, and MVM Inc., which until 2008 contracted with the government to supply guards in Iraq. MVM recently put up job postings seeking “bilingual travel youth care workers” in the McAllen area of South Texas. It described the jobs as providing care to immigrant children “while you are accompanying them on domestic flights and via ground transportation to shelters all over the country.”</p>

<p>The migrant-shelter business has been booming since family separations began on a large scale last month along the southwest border.</p>

<p>For years, including during the Obama administration, contractors housed children who were caught illegally crossing the border unaccompanied by a parent or guardian. After the new policy, the contractors put in new beds and expanded beyond their licensed capacities to house the growing numbers of children the government separated from their families. In Texas alone, 15 shelters have received variances from state officials to expand, including adding bedroom space and toilets, increasing the total licensed capacity in Texas to nearly 5,300 children, from around 4,500.</p>

<p>The shelters’ rush to house, and cash in on, the surge of children has made them a new target for Democrats, immigrant advocates and a vocal chorus of local, state and federal officials and community leaders.</p>

<p>Many of these contractors, including Southwest Key, whose president and chief executive, Juan Sánchez, has been a well-known and politically connected figure in South Texas for years, saw themselves as the good guys in all the years they were sheltering, housing and educating young people who had crossed the border on their own. But as their client base increasingly has included children forcibly removed from their parents, that public good will has eroded.</p>

<p>Critics have released tax records showing Mr. Sánchez’s compensation — more than $770,000 in 2015 alone — and his organization’s usually under-the-radar efforts to open new shelters have become pitched public battles. In Houston, a number of Democratic officials, including Mayor Sylvester Turner, called on Mr. Sánchez to abandon plans to turn a former homeless shelter into a new migrant youth shelter near downtown. Mr. Turner and others said they would urge state regulators to deny the proposed shelter a child-care-facility license.</p>

<p>Some have raised concerns that the rush to expand will make it difficult to properly manage the housing and care of infants, toddlers and teenagers, all of whom have a host of complex emotional, health and legal issues. In recent years, a number of migrant youth shelters have run into problems unseen by the public: fire-code violations, lawsuits claiming abuse, and complaints from employees alleging wrongful termination and unpaid wages.</p>

<p>Migrant children in a recreation area outside Casa Padre.</p>

<p>The former Walmart shelter failed two of its 12 fire inspections, including for sprinkler-system problems, but passed its most recent inspection this month. State officials have investigated allegations of sexual abuse and neglectful supervision at numerous facilities.</p>

<p>Shelter executives and their supporters, as well as federal officials, say they stand behind the contractors’ management, their fiscal responsibility and their overall mission.</p>

<p>“Our growth is in direct response to kids coming to the border,” said Alexia Rodriguez, Southwest Key’s vice president of immigrant children’s services.</p>

<p>She said that Southwest Key shelters must be in compliance with hundreds of standards to keep their state licenses.</p>

<p>The majority of the thousands of potential violations that are investigated each year are self-reported by Southwest Key staff to state licensing officials, who conduct an investigation and decide whether there has been a violation. When applicable, Ms. Rodriguez said, staff members under investigation are suspended pending the results.</p>

<p>The 150 or so deficiencies cited over the past three years are out of tens of thousands of potential violations, most of which were reported by Southwest Key, Ms. Rodriguez said. “We may overreport. But what’s critical is how a company responds to a possible incident,” she said. “I can say we’ve never had a deficiency that was not addressed appropriately.”</p>

<p>While Southwest Key has garnered attention because of the Trump administration’s policy of breaking up families at the border, only 10 percent of children in its facilities were separated from their relatives. The vast majority in its care still came to the United States alone as unaccompanied minors, mainly from Guatemala and El Salvador.</p>

<p>The group’s shelter capacity has grown significantly: In 2010, it had capacity for up to 500 children a day across 10 shelters. Now it can serve up to 5,000 children a day across 26 shelters. The recent surge in family separations has put even more of a demand on its facilities.</p>

<p>In Harlingen one recent morning, the federal courthouse that hears immigration cases was packed. Teenagers who had been apprehended crossing the border sat in the courtrooms, fidgeting in their rolled-up jeans and sneakers.</p>

<p>In the lobby, a group of men and women whispered among themselves as they patiently waited for the hearings to end. They were there for the migrant youth. But they were neither relatives nor lawyers. They were contractors. Their job was to escort the detained children back to nearby shelters.</p>

<p>Transportation to and from shelters is but one service supplied by contractors on the federal dime.</p>

<p>Adults and children who are apprehended illegally crossing the border are detained and housed in a variety of facilities, some of which are run by the government and some by private contractors. There are detention centers at Border Patrol stations and at facilities operated by private-prison contractors such as CoreCivic. And then there are the migrant youth shelters.</p>

<p>One of the best-known is Casa Padre, the name of Southwest Key’s shelter for 10- to 17-year-old boys at the converted Walmart. It is the largest shelter of its kind in the country, with nearly 1,500 boys.</p>

<p>The building is owned not by Walmart but by private owners, who lease it to Southwest Key. The Walmart was gutted, redesigned and renovated into a kind of mini-city, with murals, classrooms, medical offices, on-call physicians, work cubicles, movie theaters, a barbershop and a cafeteria.</p>

<p>Pre-Trump, Southwest Key was warmly received by left-leaning immigration activists and civil rights organizations. Post-Trump, some of the group’s former allies are now leading the outcry.</p>

<p>Legal organizations including the A.C.L.U. and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law represented Southwest Key in a 2015 lawsuit against Escondido, Calif., accusing the city of manipulating land use and zoning laws to block the opening of a new center that could house 96 children.</p>

<p>The lawsuit quoted Escondido citizens who had opposed the facility in letters and hearings. “I believe most of us are sick of paying for undocumented invaders,” one comment read.</p>

<p>Southwest Key eventually received a $550,000 settlement from Escondido, but during the case the organization opened housing elsewhere instead.</p>

<p>“I was taken aback by the venom that came out of certain members of that community, and the threats I received personally to my safety and security,” said Ms. Rodriguez, the Southwest Key executive. “These are innocent children that have done nothing wrong, fleeing violent communities, and this is the response we were getting in Escondido?”</p>

<p>Migrant shelter operators say they have been wrongly thought to be housing youths in the kind of heavily crowded facilities near border crossings at which migrants receive their initial processing.</p>

<p>Images of children in chain-link cages and pens that have circulated online recently are mainly taken at Border Patrol sites run by the government. Housing at places like Southwest Key facilities generally include dorms, classroom areas and medical and counseling centers.</p>

<p>“If we ever put a kid in a cage, we’d be shut down for mistreating children,” said Ms. Rodriguez. “People are conflating us with the facilities run by Border Patrol, which is a division of Homeland Security. We work with the social service side of the federal government. We are not law enforcement.”</p>

<h2 id="kirstjennielsenisconfrontedbyprotestersatmexicanrestaurantshame">Kirstjen Nielsen Is Confronted by Protesters at Mexican Restaurant: ‘Shame!’</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Sarah Mervosh</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/kirstjen-nielsen-protesters-restaurant.html </p>

<p>Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, got an earful while she was eating dinner at a Mexican restaurant in Washington on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>With tensions continuing to escalate over the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” immigration policy that separates children from their families after illegal crossings at the border, a group of protesters confronted her.</p>

<p>“If kids don’t eat in peace, you don’t eat in peace,” the protesters shouted, according to video footage of the encounter that they posted on social media.</p>

<p>Ms. Nielsen at a White House press briefing on Monday in which she defended the administration’s policies.</p>

<p>The group also led chants of “shame!” One protester took issue with the fact that Ms. Nielsen was enjoying dinner at a Mexican restaurant, “of all places.”</p>

<p>Ms. Nielsen, who is responsible for carrying out President Trump’s efforts to reduce immigration, did not appear to respond to the protesters during the almost 11-minute video.</p>

<p>Metro D.C. Democratic Socialists of America, which works for social and economic justice, claimed responsibility for the protest. A spokesman for the group said that a diner had tipped off the group that Ms. Nielsen was eating at MXDC Cocina Mexicana, an upscale restaurant by Todd English, a celebrity chef.</p>

<p>About 15 activists arrived at the restaurant around 8 p.m., the spokesman said.</p>

<p>The group interrupted what a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security described as a “work dinner.”</p>

<p>“While having a work dinner tonight, the secretary and her staff heard from a small group of protesters who share her concern with our current immigration laws that have created a crisis on our southern border,” a department spokesman, Tyler Q. Houlton, posted on Twitter. He shifted the focus to Congress, asking people who are concerned about immigration to reach out to their representatives.</p>

<p>Ms. Nielsen also took to Twitter on Tuesday night, retweeting a message from President Trump saying that she did a “fabulous job” at a news conference on Monday. She also posted that she would “work tirelessly until our broken immigration system is fixed, our borders are secure and families can stay together.”</p>

<p>Metro D.C. Democratic Socialists of America released a statement from a member of its steering committee, Margaret McLaughlin: “We will not stand by and let Secretary Nielsen dine in peace, while she is directing her employees to tear little girls away from their mothers and crying boys away from their fathers at our border.”</p>

<p>She added that while Ms. Nielsen’s dinner “may have been ruined, it is nothing compared to the horrors she has inflicted on innocent families.”</p>

<p>In a statement on Wednesday morning, a spokeswoman for MXDC Cocina Mexicana said that the restaurant’s employees handled “the situation in the best interest of safety for everyone.”</p>

<p>“Our staff, most of whom are Hispanic, have been with our restaurant family for years,” the statement said. “They represent hosts, servers, kitchen staff and upper management who take care of each and every guest who dines with us. We believe that a restaurant is a place to nourish the spirit of humanity, not to break it down.”</p>

<p id="byline">by: Simon Romero</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/republicans-family-separation.html </p>

<p>Representative Will Hurd, right, a Texas Republican, said he heard from many voters who were upset about the Trump administration’s policy of separating undocumented migrant children from parents.</p>

<p>CASTROVILLE, Tex. — In the three years since Donald J. Trump began his presidential bid by maligning Mexican immigrants, Representative Will Hurd, a Texas Republican in a Democratic-leaning district, has faced voters of all stripes who were angry about Mr. Trump’s divisive style.</p>

<p>But Mr. Hurd, who represents a heavily Hispanic region that stretches across 800 miles of the Mexican border, could not recall a moment when people were as appalled as they were over the images of anguished children separated from their migrant parents.</p>

<p>“All the calls and emails I’ve gotten in my office are from constituents saying: ‘Why are we doing this, this is against our values,’” Mr. Hurd said. The president’s policy had damaged the Republican brand, he said, because “nobody understands why you would take children out of their parents’ hands.”</p>

<p>Yet many rank-and-file Republican voters in border states see it differently, creating another kind of pressure for lawmakers like Mr. Hurd. Whatever sympathy these voters feel for the children is complicated, they say, by their intense frustration over the flow of migrants from Mexico.</p>

<p>In interviews across the Southwest and Florida on Wednesday, many Republicans said that they appreciated President Trump’s emphasis on “zero tolerance” for illegal border crossings, and wished there were as much furor over those immigrants as there was over the separation of parents and children — an administration policy that Mr. Trump reversed under pressure from Republicans like Mr. Hurd.</p>

<p>“You don’t ever want to be separating families, but at least the president focused attention on all the people crossing the border illegally,” said Helen Delavan, 79, a retired school secretary in Castroville, Tex., and a supporter of both Mr. Trump and Mr. Hurd.</p>

<p>Marcella Lagleder, 65, a retired software developer who runs an arts and crafts shop in Castroville, said the political turmoil over migrant families left her wondering “why we’re still being so open to the illegals.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we’re mistreating them,” Ms. Lagleder said. “It’d be different if they were put in a doghouse or something like that.”</p>

<p>From Arizona and New Mexico to Texas and Florida, conservative-leaning voters were divided over how to handle the families and on immigration policy more broadly, a reflection of the Republican fissures that have stymied immigration legislation for over a decade. Interviews with these voters in some of the most hotly contested, heavily Hispanic states and congressional districts illustrate the bind Republicans find themselves in: They need to retain support from voters who have little sympathy for undocumented immigrants and also win over more moderate voters horrified by Mr. Trump’s remarks about Hispanics.</p>

<p>Republican lawmakers and strategists said the president’s “zero tolerance” policy had created a political crisis for the party at a time when Republicans badly want to be taking credit for the improving economy. Instead of talking about the second-quarter economic growth that could near 5 percent, Republicans worry they are handing Democrats a potent line of attack for the midterms.</p>

<p>Yet while the searing photographs of children locked in cages left many Democrats and independents deeply dismayed, many Republicans were less sympathetic about the plight of migrants who knowingly broke the law.</p>

<p>Julio Martinez, 74, who headed Mr. Trump’s Miami-area campaign, defended the president’s hard-line approach.</p>

<p>“It hurts my heart to see it, but the culpable ones are the parents who subject their children to crossing the border, or who send them by themselves,” Mr. Martinez said. “If we start breaking laws ourselves, what is this country going to become? All of those multimillionaires who live in Hollywood, why don’t they let all those illegals live in their houses?”</p>

<p>But Michelle Garcia, 42, a cafe owner in Los Lunas, N.M., where there is an open House seat in a district that is majority-Hispanic and likely to be highly competitive, said the family separations had been “merciless and counterproductive.”</p>

<p>Border Patrol agents took Central American asylum seekers into custody near McAllen, Tex.</p>

<p>But what’s especially worrisome for Republicans in states like Florida, where there are hard-fought races for governor, Senate and a handful of House seats this year, is that the president is not just alienating voters with his policies. Equally troubling is his use of harsh and demagogic language when describing Latinos, a tone he seemed to amplify in a series of tweets and speeches as pressure on him grew this week.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump’s claim that unauthorized migrants “infest our country,” for example, has left some Hispanic Republicans angry and concerned that he’s driving away up-for-grabs voters.</p>

<p>“It’s unbelievable,” said Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a veteran Florida Republican who is of Cuban descent. “That kind of divisive language hurts us.”</p>

<p>Representative Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican locked in a highly competitive re-election fight, said Mr. Trump’s warnings about the threat of migrants had “been dehumanizing.”</p>

<p>There are few House Republicans who are as frustrated with the Trump administration over immigration as Mr. Curbelo, who represents one of the most Democratic-leaning districts of any Republican in the country and has been working for months on a compromise for “Dreamers,” those brought to the country illegally as children.</p>

<p>In an interview, he complained that the family separation policy was “a unilateral decision by Jeff Sessions,” adding that the hard-line attorney general has “freelanced on a number of issues.”</p>

<p>What is clear from the interviews with voters, however, is that Mr. Trump’s warnings about the peril presented by immigrants are being heard — and echoed by some of his supporters.</p>

<p>“The last thing I want is this place to end up like Germany or Europe, where they’re blowing up stuff and knife attacks and things like that,” said Ryan Farnsworth, 44, who works in the construction industry in Phoenix and voted for the president.</p>

<p>How Trump’s Policy Change Separated Migrant Children From Their Parents</p>

<p>The steps taken once families are apprehended by agents at the United States-Mexico border, and how adults and children are processed differently.</p>

<p>June 20, 2018</p>

<p>[As word of the policy spread among migrants in Mexico, some reconsidered their trips. Others did not.]</p>

<p>Mr. Farnsworth was sounding the same note Mr. Trump did this week, when he falsely claimed that crime in Germany had spiked and said Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition was at risk because of permissive refugee policies.</p>

<p>Standing next to a bank of Spanish-language newspapers outside the Maricopa County Courthouse, Mr. Farnsworth said that he saw the president’s family separation policy as an unfortunate but practical deterrent that could have helped secure the borders.</p>

<p>“Do I like seeing families pulled apart? Absolutely not,” he said, just as a Hispanic woman and her young son scooted by, hand in hand. “But it is no different than if I were to go commit a crime, I went to jail, I’d lose my children, too; they’d be stripped from me.”</p>

<p>It is voters like Mr. Farnsworth who have created pressure on Republican politicians like Representative Martha McSally, who is running for Senate in Arizona and trying to accommodate the hard-liners who dominate the Republican Party’s overwhelmingly white base there without offending the broader, more racially diverse electorate.</p>

<p>And the challenge is even more acute on the border, where Lea Márquez-Peterson is running for Ms. McSally’s seat in a district that includes both staunch border hawks and recent immigrants.</p>

<p>“It’s a very split district,” said Ms. Márquez-Peterson, a Republican who previously ran the Tucson Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. “We should have passed a comprehensive immigration bill years ago.”</p>

<p>In New Mexico — which has the highest percentage of citizens with Hispanic ancestry in the country — voters more frequently expressed discomfort with the separation policy.</p>

<p>“It’s sad,” said Andrew Baca, 28, a Belen, N.M., barber and former soldier who is Latino. “We’re all immigrants, bro. America is made of immigrants.”</p>

<p>But the challenge for Democrats in this sprawling and heavily rural New Mexico district currently held by Representative Steve Pearce, a Republican, is that voters who may not like Mr. Trump’s immigration policies are uneasy with the liberal line on guns and abortion rights.</p>

<p>“My vote wouldn’t necessarily change because of the separation only,” Mr. Baca said.</p>

<p>Back in Mr. Hurd’s district — which includes the Tornillo holding facility where some of the children have been detained — his Democratic opponent, Gina Ortiz Jones, suggested the incumbent’s outrage was inspired by his re-election bid.</p>

<p>“It took kids in cages for him to speak up,” said Ms. Ortiz Jones, a former Air Force officer, arguing that the Republican’s voting record suggested fidelity to Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>But the good news for Mr. Hurd, a former C.I.A. officer who survived 2016 even as Hillary Clinton carried the district, is that many voters here say they intend to support him, no matter their view on the separation of children from their parents.</p>

<p>Robert Belitz, a Democrat selling melons from the back of his truck on the main road cutting through Castroville, expressed disgust at the policy.</p>

<p>“This isn’t some authoritarian state,” he said, before adding he would still back Mr. Hurd, whom he deemed “a good man who delivers on what he says.”</p>

<p>For Mr. Hurd to win again along the Rio Grande, he would need such voters to remain in his corner — and for Mr. Trump to not make that task more difficult.</p>

<p>“Whenever we’re not able to talk about how the economy is doing well, how unemployment is low, and instead we’re talking about taking babies from their mothers — that’s not an environment that’s going to be helpful,” Mr. Hurd said.</p>

<p>An encampment for immigrant children in Tornillo, Tex., on Tuesday. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that “all of the members of the Republican conference support a plan that keeps families together.”</p>

<p>(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>Here’s what you need to know:</p>

<p>Seeking a fix for the border crisis</p>

<p>• Senate Republicans have one plan. The House has its own. But there’s no widespread agreement on how to end the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy of separating immigrant children from parents who enter the country illegally.</p>

<p>President Trump hasn’t endorsed any of the ideas, and he has rejected calls that he change the policy himself.</p>

<p>The uproar has galvanized the business world, and corporate leaders on Tuesday condemned the breaking up of migrant families. (The chief of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd Blankfein, was a notable exception.)</p>

<p>The face of “zero tolerance” </p>

<p>• Last month, Kirstjen Nielsen was said to be prepared to quit her job as Homeland Security secretary.</p>

<p>She has now become the most visible defender of the administration’s efforts to discourage illegal immigration. On Tuesday night, she was heckled by protesters while eating dinner at a Mexican restaurant in Washington.</p>

<p>The creators of “Family Guy” and “Modern Family” are among several prominent entertainers working for the company that owns Fox News who have criticized how the network has covered the issue.</p>

<p>• Separately, the U.S. has withdrawn from the U.N. Human Rights Council to protest its frequent criticism of Israel’s treatment of Palestinians. (The U.S. joins Iran, North Korea and Eritrea.)</p>

<p>Betting that China will blink</p>

<p>• “President Trump has given China every chance to change its aggressive behavior. China does have much more to lose than we do.”</p>

<p>That was Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump’s top trade adviser, on Tuesday, noting that the value of China’s exports to the U.S. was nearly four times what the U.S. exports to China.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump is now threatening to tax nearly the total value of goods — more than $505 billion — that China sent to the U.S. last year. His stance has drawn a rebuke from retailers, tech companies and manufacturers. Here’s the latest in the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing.</p>

<p>• In other global economic news, Greece is preparing to emerge from nearly a decade of bailouts. European officials have hailed it as a symbolic end to a ruinous crisis, but new problems lurk elsewhere in the region.</p>

<p>A gastro pub with an unusual past</p>

<p>• La Punto, a restaurant recommended to World Cup visitors in Sochi, Russia, has a less savory past: The building once housed the drug-testing lab involved in one of the most elaborate cheating schemes in sports history.</p>

<p>Where soccer fans now gather, a chemist tampered with urine samples during the 2014 Olympics to conceal the widespread use of banned performance-enhancing drugs by top Russian athletes.</p>

<p>One of our reporters visited the restaurant, where the only clue to the site’s notorious past can be found on the cocktail menu. One drink is called Meldonium, the name of the substance that led to Maria Sharapova’s suspension from tennis.</p>

<p>As soccer fans watched the Russia-Egypt match at La Punto on Tuesday, the building that placed a pockmark on Russian sports suddenly became a place to celebrate it.</p>

<p>Business</p>

<p>• Walt Disney sharply increased its offer for 21st Century Fox today, hoping to win a bidding war with Comcast for Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment conglomerate.</p>

<p>• The number of Americans seeking Social Security disability benefits is plunging, the latest evidence of a stronger economy pulling people back into the job market. The drop is so significant that the agency has added four years to its estimate of how long the program will be financially secure.</p>

<p>• Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross shorted stock in a shipping firm — a tactic for profiting if share prices fall — days after learning that reporters were preparing a potentially negative story about his dealings with the Kremlin-linked company.</p>

<p>• General Electric, the last original member of the Dow Jones industrial average, was dropped from the blue-chip index after more than a century.</p>

<p>• What we’re reading</p>

<p>Michael Wines, a national correspondent, recommends this long read in The Atlantic: “You may disagree with the premise (and judging by the online response, a lot of people do), but this is probably medicine worth taking. The big income-disparity problem with America, the author argues, isn’t the top 1 percent but the top 9.9 percent — the lawyers, doctors, M.B.A.s and others who consider themselves just upper middle class. Which, he says, they most definitely aren’t.”</p>

<p>Back Story</p>

<p>Steven Spielberg’s genre-defining film “Jaws” was released on this day in 1975. It was his first big-budget film, and it ushered in one of the industry’s most successful careers.</p>

<p>But the production was troubled with delays and budget-busting costs. Crew members called it “Flaws,” and Mr. Spielberg — not yet 30 years old — worried he might never work in Hollywood again. “No one had ever taken a film 100 days over schedule,” he said.</p>

<p>Especially problematic were three animatronic sharks meant to serve as the focal predator. Collectively known as Bruce (after Mr. Spielberg’s lawyer), they proved disappointingly unmenacing. And they corroded and malfunctioned because the young director insisted on the realism of filming in the ocean, not in a tank.</p>

<p>Unable to show more than a few scenes of the film’s linchpin, Mr. Spielberg improvised. He filmed some scenes from the shark’s point of view and signaled its presence with John Williams’ now-iconic theme song. The result: a Hitchcockian buildup of tension and suspense. (The Times review was a bit dismissive.)</p>

<p>Even the production delays ended up helping. “Jaws” missed the traditional Christmas window, and a later release (and a marketing blitz) made it one of the first summer blockbusters.</p>

<h2 id="inbidtoendchildseparationshousegoppressesaheadwithbroadimmigrationplan">In Bid to End Child Separations, House G.O.P. Presses Ahead With Broad Immigration Plan</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Thomas Kaplan</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/ryan-trump-immigration-family-separation.html </p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Speaker Paul D. Ryan said Wednesday that the House would press ahead with a vote on a broad immigration bill that includes language to curb the Trump administration’s practice of separating families on the border.</p>

<p>“We don’t think families should be separated, period,” Mr. Ryan said. “We’ve seen the videos, heard the audio.”</p>

<p>But doubts persisted about the bill’s chances of passage when it comes up for a vote on Thursday, and Senate Republicans were pursuing a different strategy. In that chamber, lawmakers were working to develop narrow legislation that would address the issue of separating families on the border.</p>

<p>For now, at least, Mr. Ryan declined to entertain the possibility of considering a narrower measure aimed at stopping the separation of migrant families.</p>

<p>“Right now, we’re focused on passing this legislation that’s coming to the floor tomorrow,” Mr. Ryan said.</p>

<p>The House measure, a compromise negotiated by conservatives and moderates, was not originally conceived to address the issue of children being separated from parents who come into the United States illegally. It would provide a path to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants, known as Dreamers, while making significant changes to the immigration system and providing billions of dollars for President Trump’s promised wall along the southwest border with Mexico.</p>

<p>In light of the family separation issue, though, House Republicans added new language to the bill in an effort to address that matter.</p>

<p>The legislation would keep families together when people are being prosecuted under the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy for illegally crossing the border, Mr. Ryan told reporters. The speaker said that families would remain together in the custody of the Department of Homeland Security while legal proceedings play out.</p>

<p>“We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Mr. Ryan said. “The administration says it wants Congress to act, and we are.”</p>

<p>It is highly questionable whether the compromise bill will be able to pass the House. The bill was negotiated as House leaders tried to head off a rebellion from moderate members eager for action to address the fate of the Dreamers. Critics on the right have already labeled it as “amnesty.”</p>

<h2 id="evangelicalleaderslamentborderseparationsbutstandbehindtrump">Evangelical Leaders Lament Border Separations, but Stand Behind Trump</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Elizabeth Dias</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/evangelicals-immigration-trump.html </p>

<p>The evangelist Franklin Graham has criticized the family separations taking place at the border but has not blamed President Trump’s administration.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Long one of President Trump’s most ardent defenders, the evangelist Franklin Graham voiced strenuous dissent this week about the practice of separating families at the border, even calling it “disgraceful.” His comments, along with other criticism from the evangelical community, raised the possibility that the president’s support from conservative Christians might erode as outrage mounted over the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy.</p>

<p>But if evangelical leaders were pained by the sight of children being taken from their parents, they did not directly fault Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>Instead, many blamed Congress and past administrations, Republican and Democrat, and emphasized that Mr. Trump called family separation “horrible” in a tweet and that he wanted a legislative fix for immigration. And though it is too early to know the electoral consequences of the policy, few conservative Christian political leaders have been concerned that Mr. Trump will lose support among their ranks, which represent one of his most important voting blocs.</p>

<p>“This is not the administration’s fault,” Mr. Graham said in an interview on Monday, while reiterating his stance against family separation. “I don’t point the finger at Trump.’’</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>But even Mr. Trump, after weeks of pushing his administration’s policy and asserting, wrongly, that current law required family separation, retreated on Wednesday afternoon. He signed an executive order to end his administration’s policy of separating families and instead said they could be detained together indefinitely. The order said that officials would continue to criminally prosecute all who cross the border illegally, and it may face a legal challenge.</p>

<p>Mr. Graham had also accused lawmakers of visiting detention centers for political gain, after recent high-profile trips by Democrats. “This administration is extremely concerned,” Mr. Graham said before votes in Congress on two immigration proposals expected this week. “They’ve got to have some Democrats cross the aisle.”</p>

<p>Undocumented migrants waited for asylum hearings outside the port of entry in Tijuana, Mexico, on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Robert Jeffress, the pastor of First Baptist Dallas, who gave a controversial prayer at the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem last month, said he fully supported the president’s policy. He called the separation of families “gut-wrenching” and the optics of the situation “horrible.” But he said it was more gut-wrenching to see immigrants enter the country illegally and harm or kill Americans, echoing one of the president’s prime arguments for “zero tolerance.”</p>

<p>Their stances underscored the delicate path evangelical leaders had to tread as they expressed deep unease about border separations, while still maintaining staunch opposition to illegal immigration and showing loyalty to a president who has consistently delivered on their policy goals.</p>

<p>There were some schisms beneath the unified front, however, as frustration mountedamong Hispanic evangelicals, one of the fastest-growing religious groups in the United States. Wilfredo De Jesús, who leads the largest Assemblies of God church in the country, New Life Covenant in Chicago, said that the close ties between the conservative evangelical leadership and Mr. Trump are part of the problem.</p>

<p>“The white evangelicals need to stand up to him and say, ‘Hey we voted for you, but you need to do something about this,’ ” Mr. De Jesús said in an interview on Monday. “I feel disappointed in them.”</p>

<p>Randall Balmer, professor of religion at Dartmouth College, echoed that sentiment. “The persistence of evangelical support for Trump, both his personal behavior and now his immigrations policies, finally lays to rest the illusion that the religious right was ever concerned about ‘family values,’” he wrote in a text.</p>

<p>The highest-level religious criticism of the border separations to date came Wednesday morning from Pope Francis, who called the Trump administration’s policy “immoral” in an interview with Reuters. ”Populism is not the solution,” he said.</p>

<p>In another sign of dissent, more than 600 members of the United Methodist Church signed a statement this week accusing Attorney General Jeff Sessions — whose department was charged with enforcing the separation policy — with child abuse, immorality and racial discrimination. They recommended that Mr. Sessions reclaim his values and “repair the damage he is currently causing to immigrants, particularly children and families.’’</p>

<p>How Trump’s Policy Change Separated Migrant Children From Their Parents</p>

<p>The steps taken once families are apprehended by agents at the United States-Mexico border, and how adults and children are processed differently.</p>

<p>June 20, 2018</p>

<p>But some evangelical leaders, like Mr. Graham, have straddled the line. Jentezen Franklin, the pastor of the Free Chapel in Gainesville, Ga., another informal evangelical adviser to Mr. Trump, said he disagreed with Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s decision to cite a passage from the Bible to defend the administration’s policy. And he called separating families “deplorable” and “bordering on abuse” for the children.</p>

<p>But he did not blame Mr. Trump for separating families, either. “He inherited the problem, but he is trying to fix it,” he said in an interview. “It’s on the Congress.”</p>

<p>The Faith and Freedom Coalition, the conservative religious group led by Ralph Reed, sent a letter to House lawmakers on Tuesday urging them to vote in favor of both immigration bills. Mr. Reed, the group’s chairman, said that ending the family-separation component was a part of larger immigration priorities, including the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and border security.</p>

<p>In language that reframed the logic of family separation for evangelical voters, who have long supported anti-trafficking measures, he said that human traffickers often posed as parents to bring children across the border illegally.</p>

<p>“The Democrats are so busy playing politics with the separation issue that they are ignoring the bigger problem, which is the exploitation of minor children by traffickers,” Mr. Reed said in an interview between meetings on Capitol Hill on Monday.</p>

<p>As the political fight plays out in Washington, it has revealed competing priorities in conservative evangelical America, the pull between political and pastoral. Immigration is not one of the core issues for Concerned Women of America, a conservative Christian political organization that campaigns against abortion and in support of Israel and religious liberty. But Penny Nance, the group’s president, called the family-separation problem “heartbreaking” and issued a statement on Tuesday calling on Congress to act.</p>

<p>“The whole base is suddenly involved,” she said in an interview. “People who don’t normally pay attention, you have our attention.”</p>

<p>The debate is also a further sign of demographic tensions in evangelical communities as the movement changes. White evangelicals have long been among the president’s most loyal supporters, while nonwhite evangelicals have often expressed frustration with his stance on matters of race and immigration.</p>

<p>In May, eight evangelical women from Chicago piled into a passenger van and took turns driving through the night to visit hundreds of immigrant women detained at the T. Don Hutto Residential Center in Taylor, Tex. They brought the women tamales and Puerto Rican rice, gave them Bibles and prayed.</p>

<p>Many of the detained women had left their children with relatives, while others had children who were already in the United States. They were struggling with guilt and confusion, said Brenda Bravatty, the pastor of an evangelical church in Chicago, Casa de Misericordia, who was on the trip.</p>

<p>“We encouraged them that they were going to see their children again,” she said, adding that some women had been there for more than a year. “What happens at the border, everything is destroyed for them. We have to rebuild their self confidence and trust.”</p>

<p>Last week, Mr. De Jesús, the Chicago pastor who has also visited the center in Texas, prayed at the National Hispanic Prayer Breakfast in Washington, where Vice President Mike Pence; Speaker Paul D. Ryan; the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi; and the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, all spoke on immigration.</p>

<p>Mr. De Jesús said he viewed it all as political posturing, especially before the midterms, and expressed frustration that Democrats did not overhaul immigration laws when they controlled Congress under President Barack Obama, as the Republicans do now under Mr. Trump. Hispanic evangelical pastors, he said, are fed up.</p>

<p>“I’m dissatisfied at how the Republicans and Democrats are using family, an institution God created, as pawns for their benefit,” Mr. De Jesús said. “This is going to continue to deteriorate, get worse before it gets better.”</p>

<h2 id="americaninternmentcamps">American Internment Camps</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Richard Parker</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p>A tent city in Tornillo, Tex., is housing minors who entered the country illegally.</p>

<p>TORNILLO, Tex. — Late last week a sprawling tent city opened in Tornillo, outside El Paso. It is surrounded by chain-link fencing topped with barbed wire and hemmed in between the Rio Grande and I-10. Like several others along the United States-Mexico border, the Tornillo facility is intended to hold children apprehended for entering this country illegally.</p>

<p>But it’s also different. The other facilities, like the converted Walmart in Brownsville, are the equivalent of short-term holding cells where parents and children are separated and then processed out to other facilities. In contrast, the Tornillo facility, already home to perhaps dozens of teenage boys — very little is known about it, and no reporters have been allowed inside — will hold hundreds of minors, possibly for months at a time. Whatever the federal government chooses to call it, this is an internment camp. (On Wednesday President Trump said he was preparing an executive order “keeping families together.”)</p>

<p>Much of West Texas has been turned into a new front in the Trump administration’s war on undocumented immigrants. And wars take prisoners. Some 900 adult immigrants are locked up in the El Paso County jail. Children are held at facilities run by a private outfit, Southwest Key Programs. The government is reportedly planning to incarcerate still more people on military bases in El Paso, Abilene and San Angelo.</p>

<p>Like a lot of wars, too, this one is long on secrecy. When I approached the facility, I was brusquely told to leave. The local Customs and Border Protection spokesman claimed to know nothing about the camp, just steps out his station’s backdoor. The Health and Human Services Department returned no phone calls. Representative Beto O’Rourke, a Democrat from El Paso who led a march here Sunday, was told he would need to wait two weeks for an appointment; his colleague, Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts, was simply turned away.</p>

<p>However, Representative Will Hurd, a Republican whose district includes Tornillo, and State Representative Mary Gonzalez, a Democrat who also represents Tornillo, did get into the camp late Friday night. In an interview, Ms. Gonzalez described inmates as 16- and 17-year-old boys, assigned 20 to a tent for sleep. A big tent, closest to the gate, serves as mess hall. All are air-conditioned. The place is livable, she said — but “also dehumanizing.”</p>

<p>In a handful of photos released by the Department of Homeland Security on Monday, the metal, military-style bunks are stacked one on top of the other; the tent ceiling seems close enough to touch from the top bunk. The mess hall is brightly lit and furnished with folding chairs and plastic folding tables. The photos show a dozen smaller tents on concrete and with a yard of gravel and portable toilets outside, where temperatures this week will soar into the hundreds. There are one or two command posts — one was trucked in from the Texas state government — as well as an ambulance, medical van, caseworkers, therapists and nurse practitioners, according to Representative Gonzalez. A soccer goal stands on a dirt field.</p>

<p>Further information is vague and contradictory. Some reports say that only unaccompanied minors are being held at the camp, but Representative O’Rourke said he was told that about 20 percent of the boys at Tornillo were separated from their parents. The facility is officially supposed to hold a few hundred boys, but Representative Hurd said he was told on the tour that it may be expanded to hold 4,000.</p>

<p>There is something strange about a secret facility surrounded by dozens of journalists and camera crews. At the moment, it may be the most famous camp in America. “So why,” Representative Gonzalez asked after her tour, “are they trying to keep it a secret?”</p>

<p>The simple explanation is shame. This is not something liberal democracies are supposed to do. Israel and other countries closed immigrant prisons after domestic and international outcries. Libya continues to operate a desert prison for refugees and migrants. The last time the United States government separated children from parents on this scale was the late 19th century, when Native American boys and girls were forced into schools so they would be taught to act white. Before that, only the institution of slavery stripped away children wholesale.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has seized 2,000 children from 2,000 parents in six weeks, according to its own statistics. With a 1996 law, the Clinton administration began locking up undocumented immigrants. The Bush administration accelerated it. The Obama administration held entire families briefly in cells called “hieleras” — or ice boxes, because they were so cold — before an immigration hearing. But until now, no one held children captive apart from families.</p>

<p>As a result, these places are most reminiscent of the American internment camps of World War II. Coincidentally, one of the most notorious was called Crystal City, located 110 miles southwest of San Antonio. It held over 3,000 people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War II, including native-born American citizens. But even that camp was more humane: Schooling was provided for children, who were kept with families, said Carl Takei, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union whose own grandparents were split by that war: his grandmother in a camp and his grandfather fighting for the United States Army in Europe.</p>

<p>The government calls Tornillo and other sites “detention” facilities, emphasizing its view that the occupants are above all lawbreakers. But “internment” seems a better, more realistic and accurate term. It describes the confinement of prisoners of war, citizens of other nations and political prisoners without trial. With its troops, walls and arrests, the Trump administration is effectively waging war on a comparatively peaceful stretch of its own country, where no crisis existed.</p>

<p>Detention also implies some measure of due process. But while the teenagers here may see an immigration judge, it will be an administrative, nonjudicial proceeding. And if history is any guide they probably won’t even get an immigration lawyer.</p>

<p>The government has said it can hold them for nearly two months. If it’s true, then the camp in Tornillo may soon grow 10 times its current size. It is unclear when or how any of these boys will find their families again. Behind the secrets, fences and barbed wire, this is a 21st-century American internment camp. For children.</p>

<h2 id="whatsbehindthetenderagesheltersopeningforyoungmigrants">What’s Behind the ‘Tender Age’ Shelters Opening for Young Migrants</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/tender-age-shelters-family-separation-immigration.html </p>

<p>Elsy Hernandez, right, a Honduran migrant, with her children Genesis, 5, center, and David, 9, on the Mexican side of a bridge to Brownsville, Tex., on Wednesday. The family has been waiting since Sunday to be allowed into the United States to ask for asylum.</p>

<p>The shelters were intended for children under the age of 12, referred to as “tender age” detainees, who are entering the detention system in ever-larger numbers under the Trump administration’s practice of separating children from parents who enter the country illegally.</p>

<p>Many are toddlers and babies and require special care, and their numbers have been rising since last month, when the government enforced a “zero tolerance” policy on people crossing the border. Estimates suggest that more than 2,400 children under the age of 12 are now in federal custody, including many who have been separated from their parents.</p>

<p>But on Wednesday, faced with the intense criticism over the shelters and the separation of families, President Trump retreated, signing an executive order that would detain parents and children together. For now, it seems the separations will stop, but it remains unclear what will happen going forward. A Health and Human Services official said that children already separated will not be immediately reunited with their parents while the adults remain in custody during their immigration proceedings.</p>

<p>The executive order came just hours after reports that three centers in southern Texas — in Brownsville, Combes and Raymondville — were being outfitted to accommodate younger children.</p>

<p>A person inside a shelter in Brownsville, Tex., took a series of pictures and supplied them to The New York Times. The facility, which houses babies and toddlers, is operated by Southwest Key Programs, the same nonprofit group that operates a shelter at a former Walmart.</p>

<p>One image showed a toddler girl who is about 12 months old, playing on a colorful mat decorated with the letters of the alphabet and drawings of animals. The workers and others standing around the little girl wear blue hospital-style bootees to keep the wooden floor clean.</p>

<p>The girl was separated from her relatives for about a month as part of the family-separation policy, according to the person who took the photo, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release an image.</p>

<p>On Monday, photos emerged from inside a shelter in Brownsville, Tex., with a toddler crawling across a multi-color mat.</p>

<p>How Trump’s Policy Change Separated Migrant Children From Their Parents</p>

<p>The steps taken once families are apprehended by agents at the United States-Mexico border, and how adults and children are processed differently.</p>

<p>June 20, 2018</p>

<p>Representative Ben Ray Luján, Democrat of New Mexico, toured the Brownsville center on Monday with other Democratic lawmakers. The delegation said 80 migrant children were in the shelter, 40 of whom were separated from their families. The rest were unaccompanied by a parent or guardian when they were apprehended crossing the border.</p>

<p>“When we were there, the kids 5 and under were in a room taking a nap,” Mr. Luján said. He described some of the bedrooms as having four beds: a bunk bed, a single bed and a cot. “I have to imagine that these were hospital rooms that were turned into bedrooms now for the kids.”</p>

<p>He described a colorful infants room, with two cribs, two high chairs and a rubber playmat. Two little boys were wearing the same orange-striped shirt.</p>

<p>He said Representative Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston held a boy, who was 8 or 9 months old and had been separated from his family by the government. “A little boy reached out to Sheila and just held on,” Mr. Luján said.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Michael Avenatti, the lawyer who is suing Mr. Trump on behalf of a pornographic film actress, said in McAllen, Tex., that he was representing more than 50 detained immigrant mothers who have been separated from their children.</p>

<p>“I met with 10 mothers yesterday in detention,” Mr. Avenatti said. “And one by one they broke down hysterically, crying, about having their child taken from them.”</p>

<p>In some cases, he said the mothers were told that their children were being taken to be given a bath and had not been returned to them.</p>

<p>A backlash against the “tender age” shelters erupted on Tuesday night after The Associated Press first reported news of their existence. The MSNBC late night host Rachel Maddow broke down crying on the air as she read the A.P. article.</p>

<p>Referrals of young children have risen “exponentially” since the “zero tolerance” policy was announced, according to Elizabeth Frankel, associate director of the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights. The center pairs migrant children with lawyers and social workers who advocate on their behalf until they are reunited with parents.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows what to do,” Ms. Frankel said, explaining that her colleagues have been charged with caring for “a number of infants,” including some as young as 8 and 10 months. Many of the children are too young to speak, Ms. Frankel said. Without knowing where or even who the parents are, Ms. Frankel’s colleagues have struggled to advocate for the children.</p>

<p>Ms. Frankel said that contract workers were well trained and doing their best to help but that the youngest children are struggling even more than older ones because they cannot understand what is happening. “The young kids think that their parents have abandoned them, or that something very bad has happened to them,” she said.</p>

<p>“They’re in crisis. They’re just crying uncontrollably,” she said. “We’ve seen young kids having panic attacks, they can’t sleep, they’re wetting the bed. They regress developmentally, where they may have been verbal but now they can no longer talk.”</p>

<p>Since the administration’s policy became public, doctors and child welfare experts have spoken out about the potential health implications of separation, citing an increased risk for children of anxiety and depression, as well as post-traumatic stress and attention-deficit disorder.</p>

<p>The potential for long-term effects, such as prolonged emotional problems, will depend in part on the age of the children as well as the length of time during which they are separated from their parents, experts have said.</p>

<p>The shelters are run by private organizations that contract with the federal government to provide education and health care.</p>

<p>Representatives of the Health and Human Services Department, which cares for the children, did not respond to requests for data on Wednesday on the number of tender-age children in custody. But Ms. Frankel said that her organization had been informed that government facilities were at capacity.</p>

<p>“They are placing the children wherever there is an available bed,” she said. Some are being flown thousands of miles away from their parents.</p>

<p>Ms. Frankel said most of the youngest children were being placed overnight in temporary foster homes, and then transported during the day to government facilities for case management and other services. Children who were old enough were going to school during the day, she said, while the babies are kept together in rooms where they are cared for by contract workers.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/trump-immigration-children-executive-order.html </p>

<p>WASHINGTON — President Trump caved to enormous political pressure on Wednesday and signed an executive order meant to end the separation of families at the border by detaining parents and children together for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have strong — very strong — borders, but we are going to keep the families together,” Mr. Trump said as he signed the order in the Oval Office. “I didn’t like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.”</p>

<p>But ending the practice of separating families still faces legal and practical obstacles. A federal judge could refuse to give the Trump administration the authority it wants to hold families in custody for more than 20 days, which is the current limit because of a 1997 court order.</p>

<p>And the president’s order does nothing to address the plight of the more than 2,300 children who have already been separated from their parents under the president’s “zero tolerance” policy. Federal officials initially said those children would not be immediately reunited with their families while the adults remain in federal custody during their immigration proceedings.</p>

<p>“There will not be a grandfathering of existing cases,” said Kenneth Wolfe, a spokesman for the Administration for Children and Families, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. Mr. Wolfe said the decision about the children was made by the White House.</p>

<p>But later Wednesday evening, Brian Marriott, the senior director of communications for the agency, said that Mr. Wolfe had “misspoke” and insisted that “it is still very early, and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter.” Mr. Marriott said that “reunification is always the goal” and that the agency “is working toward that” for the children separated from their families because of Mr. Trump’s policy.</p>

<p>His statement left open the possibility, though, that the children could be connected with other family members or “appropriate” sponsors living in the United States, not necessarily the parent they were separated from at the border.</p>

<p>The president signed the executive order days after he said that the only way to end the division of families was through congressional action because “you can’t do it through an executive order.” But he changed his mind after a barrage of criticism from Democrats, activists, members of his own party and even his wife and eldest daughter, who privately told him the policy was wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump had previously been told by advisers that there was no way for the policy to be changed through an executive order, and it was unclear what the genesis of the measure he signed was. But the White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, had concerns about moving ahead with an executive order that would face an uphill battle in the courts.</p>

<p>The president’s chief of staff, John F. Kelly, did not voice major objections, according to a White House official. The move also helped alleviate pressure on Kirstjen Nielsen, Mr. Kelly’s protégée and handpicked successor at the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>Undocumented migrants waiting for asylum hearings on Wednesday outside the port of entry in Tijuana, Mexico.</p>

<p>Stories of children being taken from their parents, audio of wailing toddlers and images of teenagers in cagelike detention facilities had exploded into a full-blown political crisis for Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans, who were desperate for a response to those who have called the practice “inhumane,” “cruel” and “evil.”</p>

<p>The president’s four-page order says that officials will continue to criminally prosecute everyone who crosses the border illegally, but will seek to find or build facilities that can hold families — parents and children together — instead of separating them while their legal cases are considered by the courts.</p>

<p>But the action raised new questions that White House officials did not immediately answer. The order does not say where the families would be detained. And it does not say whether children will continue to be separated from their parents while the facilities to hold them are located or built.</p>

<p>Officials on a White House conference call said they could not answer those questions.</p>

<p>Justice Department officials said the legal authority to end family separation relies on a request they will make in the coming days to Judge Dolly M. Gee of the Federal District Court in Los Angeles, the daughter of immigrants from China who was appointed by President Barack Obama. She oversees a 1997 consent decree, known as the Flores settlement, which prohibits immigration authorities from keeping children in detention, even if they are with their parents, for more than 20 days.</p>

<p>The 1997 case imposes legal constraints on the proper treatment of children in government custody, which stopped Mr. Obama after his administration began detaining families together during a similar flood of illegal immigration several years ago.</p>

<p>“It’s on Judge Gee,” said Gene Hamilton, the counselor to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “Are we going to be able to detain alien families together or are we not?”</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton said the judge’s previous rulings prohibiting extended detentions of families has “put this executive branch into an untenable position.”</p>

<p>He said that the president’s order is a stopgap measure that could be fixed permanently if Congress passes legislation to overhaul the immigration system. While the House is scheduled to vote Thursday on two competing immigration bills, the president’s decision appeared to lessen the urgency for lawmakers to address the issue.</p>

<p>With Republicans in the House and Senate pursuing different approaches to put a stop to the heart-wrenching scenes at the border, no legislative breakthrough seemed imminent.</p>

<p>Republicans in the Senate have proposed narrow legislation that would end the practice, while House Republican leaders are focused on a broader bill, though its passage was in doubt on the eve of Thursday’s vote.</p>

<p>In the meantime, legal experts said it seems highly unlikely that the courts will agree to the request by the Trump administration. That would mean the president is almost certain to face an immediate legal challenge from immigration activists if the government tries to detain families for more than the 20-day limit.</p>

<p>“I don’t think anyone wants to see little children detained for long periods of time,” said Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union, which challenged the Trump administration’s separation of families. “If they start detaining families and kids in tents or other places, I think you will see immediate lawsuits.”</p>

<p>Kevin Appleby, a senior director at the Center for Migration Studies, predicted such a challenge.</p>

<p>Advocates said officials should jail only those immigrants who have committed other crimes, are a flight risk or pose a danger to others.</p>

<p>“It is outrageous that the president is pushing the criminal detention of innocent children as a solution to his own evil act,” Mr. Appleby said. “The best solution would be releasing families to sponsors or placing them in community-based alternatives to detention programs, which are less expensive and much more humane.”</p>

<p>Until Wednesday, Mr. Trump had refused to simply end his government’s zero-tolerance policy that was announced last month and led to the separation of more than 2,300 children from their parents, saying that the alternative would be to fling open the country’s borders and allow immigrants who cross the border illegally to remain in the United States.</p>

<p>But the president, furious about the pummeling he has taken in the news media in recent days, began casting about for a solution to the politically damaging situation, people familiar with his thinking said.</p>

<p>He made his announcement flanked by Vice President Mike Pence and Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, and vowed not to relent in his administration’s prosecution of people trying to enter the country illegally.</p>

<p>“We are keeping a very powerful border, and it continues to be a zero tolerance,” Mr. Trump said. “We have zero tolerance for people that enter our country illegally.”</p>

<p>But he added, “The border’s just as tough, but we do want to keep families together.”</p>

<p>In signing the order to end the separation of families, Mr. Trump also abandoned the positions that he and his allies had stuck to for weeks: that Democrats were to blame for the wrenching scenes of kids being torn from their parents, and that the administration was helpless to fix the problem without action by Congress to overhaul immigration laws.</p>

<p>In effect, though, the president was caught between his messaging and the likelihood of inaction on Capitol Hill. That became clearer on Tuesday when Republicans in the Senate and House moved in different directions on confronting the family separation issue.</p>

<p>How Trump’s Policy Change Separated Migrant Children From Their Parents</p>

<p>The steps taken once families are apprehended by agents at the United States-Mexico border, and how adults and children are processed differently.</p>

<p>June 20, 2018</p>

<p>Mr. Trump acknowledged his position during remarks to reporters before his announcement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>“The dilemma is that if you’re weak, if you’re weak, which some people would like you to be. If you are really, really pathetically weak, the country’s going to be overrun with millions of people,” Mr. Trump said. “And if you’re strong, then you don’t have any heart. That’s a tough dilemma. Perhaps I’d rather be strong.”</p>

<p>In addition to the public condemnations of his policy — including by Pope Francis on Wednesday — Mr. Trump had been lectured by the first lady, Melania Trump, and Ivanka Trump, his eldest daughter, according to White House officials.</p>

<p>Melania Trump had been pushing her husband about the family separation policy from the beginning, an official said, arguing that there was a middle way between opening America’s borders and tearing children away from their parents. Separating children from their mother and father, she told him, is wrong.</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, were also pressing the president to find a way to end the political crisis caused by the family separations at the border, according to people familiar with their conversations.</p>

<p>But it is not clear what the political damage may be to Mr. Trump from having taken actions that he repeatedly said he was not allowed to do.</p>

<p>As recently as Tuesday, in a speech to the National Federation of Independent Business, the president insisted that there were “only two options: totally open borders or criminal prosecution for law breaking.”</p>

<p>“And you want to be able to do that,” he said. “We don’t want people pouring into our country.”</p>

<p>The president has also opened himself up to charges of hypocrisy. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump repeatedly slammed Mr. Obama for abusing his executive authority when he issued an executive order to protect the young immigrants known as Dreamers.</p>

<p>As a candidate, Mr. Trump said he would use executive orders sparingly, adding that “Obama, because he couldn’t get anybody to agree with him, he starts signing them like they’re butter. So I want to do away with executive orders for the most part.”</p>

<p>Mr. Obama, whose administration also grappled with how to handle massive flows of illegal immigrants from Central America, has remained mostly silent during the controversy over the separation of children from their parents at the border. But in a Facebook post on Wednesday, Mr. Obama denounced the lack of morality in a policy that leads to the kinds of scenes that have played out across television screens during the past several weeks.</p>

<p>“To watch those families broken apart in real time puts to us a very simple question: are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents’ arms, or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together?” Mr. Obama wrote. “Do we look away, or do we choose to see something of ourselves and our children?”</p>

<p id="byline">by: Alexander Burns</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/mike-bloomberg-democrats-election.html </p>

<p>Michael R. Bloomberg has indicated to aides that he only wants to support candidates who share his relatively moderate political orientation.</p>

<p>Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, has decided to throw his political clout and personal fortune behind the Democratic campaign to take control of the House of Representatives this year, directing aides to spend tens of millions of dollars in an effort to expel Republicans from power.</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg — a political independent who has championed left-of-center policies on gun control, immigration and the environment — has approved a plan to pour at least $80 million into the 2018 election, with the bulk of that money going to support Democratic congressional candidates, advisers to Mr. Bloomberg said.</p>

<p>By siding so emphatically with one party, Mr. Bloomberg has the potential to upend the financial dynamics of the midterm campaign, which have appeared to favor Republicans up to this point. Facing intense opposition to President Trump and conservative policies, Republicans have been counting on a strong economy and heavily funded outside groups to give them a political advantage in key races, especially in affluent suburbs where it is expensive to run television ads.</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg’s intervention is likely to undermine that financial advantage by bankrolling advertising on television, online and in the mail for Democratic candidates in a dozen or more congressional districts, chiefly in moderate suburban areas where Mr. Trump is unpopular. Democrats need to gain 23 congressional seats to win a majority.</p>

<p>While Mr. Bloomberg has not chosen his list of targeted races yet, he is unlikely to get involved in rural, conservative-leaning districts where his views on guns and other issues could stir an uproar, according to people briefed on his plans, some of whom spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.</p>

<p>The new alliance between Mr. Bloomberg, 76, and congressional Democrats marks a fresh stage in the former mayor’s political evolution. And it promises to put New York and its political leaders even more squarely at the center of a midterm campaign already stocked with prominent characters from the city, including a president who made his fortune in Manhattan real estate; the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer; and Mr. Bloomberg’s predecessor in Gracie Mansion, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who serves as a lawyer for Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg is said to be intrigued by a list of candidates produced by Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a 39-year-old military veteran who has emerged as a leading critic of Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader.</p>

<p>[Here’s how two rogue billionaires — one on the left, one on the right — have emerged as the some of the biggest political spenders of the 2018 elections.]</p>

<p>After moving freely between elite circles in both parties for years, Mr. Bloomberg is now poised to become one of the Democrats’ most important benefactors: His spending on House campaigns appears likely to exceed the involvement of donors like Sheldon Adelson, the Republican casino billionaire who recently donated $30 million to a “super PAC” aligned with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, and Tom Steyer, the liberal hedge-fund investor spending tens of millions of dollars on voter-turnout programs and television ads demanding Mr. Trump’s impeachment.</p>

<p>Massive campaign spending by partisan billionaires — like Mr. Adelson and Mr. Steyer, and the powerful conservative donor network led by the Koch brothers — has yielded a hodgepodge of results over the years. In many cases, it has helped to amplify existing political trends, allowing parties already on the rise to gain ground even more rapidly. In other instances, billionaire-funded “super PACs” have helped parties limit their losses in difficult political conditions, as Republicans hope their outside groups will do this year. But money alone rarely determines the outcome of national elections.</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg outlined his plans in a statement, denouncing the Republican Congress and urging a return to divided control of the federal government. His 2018 effort is to be overseen by Howard Wolfson, a close adviser who is a former executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; Mr. Wolfson confirmed the scale of the spending envisioned.</p>

<p>Calling Republican leaders in the House “absolutely feckless,” Mr. Bloomberg criticized them for failing to check Mr. Trump or to exercise rigorous oversight of his presidential administration.</p>

<p>“I’ve never thought that the public is well-served when one party is entirely out of power, and I think the past year and half has been evidence of that,” Mr. Bloomberg said, lamenting that Republicans “have done little to reach across the aisle to craft bipartisan solutions — not only on guns and climate change, but also on jobs, immigration, health care, and infrastructure.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg continued: “Republicans in Congress have had almost two years to prove they could govern responsibly. They failed.”</p>

<p>In past campaigns, Mr. Bloomberg has been a highly unusual figure among megadonors, dividing his spending between the parties rather than picking one team. In 2016, he worked aggressively both to re-elect Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who co-authored a compromise gun-control bill, and to defeat Senator Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican who opposed the measure. (Mr. Toomey won; Ms. Ayotte lost.)</p>

<p>But Mr. Bloomberg began linking himself more closely with Democrats after Mr. Trump was nominated for president, giving a speech at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia endorsing Hillary Clinton. He has repeatedly rebuked Mr. Trump since the inauguration, calling the Republican tax-cut law a “trillion-dollar blunder” and becoming a United Nations envoy on climate after Mr. Trump announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris agreement on emissions.</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg’s political team is in frequent contact with Democratic leaders, including some he has relationships from his time as mayor, and with liberal-leaning advocacy groups like Emily’s List that he is likely to collaborate with in the 2018 campaign. He has conferred regularly with Representative Joseph Crowley, of Queens, who is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, as well as Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a 39-year-old military veteran who has emerged as a leading critic of Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader.</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg is said to be intrigued by a list of candidates Mr. Moulton has endorsed, many of them also veterans.</p>

<p>“Especially in these marginal suburban districts, he’s someone whose resources and credibility can help candidates in tough races,” Mr. Moulton said, adding that Mr. Bloomberg would likely be cautious about where to deploy his operation: “There are places where you want to go in very obviously, and other places where you want to do work behind the scenes.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crowley said in an interview that Mr. Bloomberg had expressed dismay to him about Republican lawmakers’ refusal to challenge Mr. Trump.</p>

<p>“He recognizes the threat of this presidency,” Mr. Crowley said.</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg will likely support Republicans in a few races for governor this year, and he donated $5,400 in April to Representative Dan Donovan, a Staten Island Republican battling a primary challenge from Michael Grimm, a former congressman who was jailed for tax evasion. Beyond that, Mr. Bloomberg is expected to spend little or nothing on Republicans at the federal level, his advisers said.</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomberg’s partisan loyalties have shifted repeatedly over the years: He was a registered Democrat before switching parties to be elected mayor in 2001, and hosted the Republican convention in New York in 2004 before leaving that party to become an independent three years later. He twice made serious preparations to run for president as an independent, in 2008 and 2016, but both times ultimately decided against it.</p>

<p>In a sign of Mr. Bloomberg’s deep alienation from the Republican Party, he has recently told associates that if he were to run for president in 2020, he would likely do so as a Democrat, according to people who have spoken with him directly.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether Mr. Bloomberg, who would be 78 on Election Day in 2020, is actively contemplating another presidential campaign or simply leaving the door open to the possibility.</p>

<p>While his money could be an enormous help to Democrats, Mr. Bloomberg is imperfectly matched with the party on important matters of policy and his involvement in the midterms has the potential to stir unease on the left. He has defended Wall Street banks over the years from liberal criticism, and as mayor he championed an aggressive approach to policing that is now anathema to much of the Democratic coalition.</p>

<p>And Mr. Bloomberg, despite his antipathy for the G.O.P., has not shed some of his reservations about the Democrats. He has indicated to aides that he only wants to support candidates who share his relatively moderate political orientation, avoiding nominees hailing from the populist left. In his statement, Mr. Bloomberg also took strong issue with any Democrats campaigning on impeachment, declaring: “Nothing could be more irresponsible.”</p>

<p>Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, a centrist Democrat who recently hosted Mr. Bloomberg at an event on Capitol Hill, said the former mayor could be most helpful in the “purple-ish” areas where Democrats hope to gain the most ground. Democrats are seeking to capture more than three-dozen Republican-held seats in the suburbs around big cities like Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Miami.</p>

<p>“He plays very well in the moderate suburbs where we need to win seats,” said Mr. Gottheimer, adding: “From my perspective, I want more pro-business, moderate Democrats in Congress next year.”</p>

<h2 id="eastpittsburghpolicekillantwonroseunarmed17yearoldasheflees">East Pittsburgh Police Kill Antwon Rose, Unarmed 17-Year-Old, as He Flees</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Christina Caron</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/pittsburgh-police-shooting.html </p>

<p>Antwon Rose, 17, in a family photograph.</p>

<p>An unarmed 17-year-old boy was shot and killed by the East Pittsburgh police on Tuesday night as he tried to flee a traffic stop, law enforcement officials said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The teenager, Antwon Rose II, was a passenger in a car that had been pulled over because it matched the description of a vehicle that fled an earlier shooting in which a 22-year-old man was wounded, the Allegheny County Police Department said in a statement.</p>

<p>A video that recorded the fatal shooting and was posted on Facebook shows two people running from police vehicles as three shots are fired. One of the people, later identified as the 17-year-old, appears to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>“Why are they shooting?” the woman recording the video says. “All they did was run and they’re shooting at them!”</p>

<p>The Allegheny County Police Department, which is investigating the encounter, said that two firearms were found on the floor of the car. When asked if the teenager was found with a weapon on his person, Coleman McDonough, the department’s superintendent, said he was not.</p>

<p>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Wednesday quoted Mayor Louis Payne of East Pittsburgh as saying that the officer who shot Antwon was hired in mid-May and had been formally sworn in hours before the shooting.</p>

<p>In a statement on Wednesday night, S. Lee Merritt, a lawyer representing Antwon’s family, said: “We know very little about the circumstances surrounding his death at this early stage. We must emphasize that rumors of him being involved in a separate shooting are unsubstantiated. We know that he was not armed at the time he was shot down, that he posed no immediate threat to anyone, and that, significantly, the driver of the vehicle he occupied was released from police custody.”</p>

<p>On Wednesday evening, dozens of people gathered outside the East Pittsburgh Police Department to protest the black teenager’s death. “No justice, no peace!” they chanted. Some carried signs that said, “Justice4Antwon” and “#BlackLivesMatter.”</p>

<p>Those who knew Antwon described him as bright, lively and funny. He was a senior at Woodland Hills High School who was expected to graduate at the end of the year, the superintendent, Al Johnson, said in an interview on Wednesday.</p>

<p>“He was an excellent student,” Mr. Johnson said, adding that Antwon was taking Advanced Placement classes.</p>

<p>With Antwon’s death, he said, “we’ve lost four students to gun violence” over the past school year.</p>

<p>Kim Ransom, the owner of Pittsburgh Gymnastics Club, where Antwon worked for about a year, recalled the sweltering day in 2015 that he interviewed to work at the club as an instructor.</p>

<p>“He brought his typed-up résumé and he was wearing a full three-piece suit with his shiny shoes and he was sweating profusely,” she said.</p>

<p>She had never seen someone arrive at the club so formally dressed for an interview.</p>

<p>“I just thought it was very cute. I think he was 14 at the time,” she said. “Someone in his life must have been guiding him in the right direction.”</p>

<p>He got the job and began coaching children in an after-school program and other classes.</p>

<p>“Everybody loved him here,” she said. “He was very mature.”</p>

<p>The scene of the shooting on Tuesday night. The authorities said two weapons were found in the car the teenager was riding in, but none were found on him.</p>

<p>“I feel like it’s important for people to know that he was Antwon,” she said. “He’s not a statistic, he’s Antwon.”</p>

<p>The traffic stop on Tuesday that led to the deadly shooting occurred after multiple 911 calls earlier in the night reported a shooting in North Braddock, Pa., that had wounded a 22-year-old man in the abdomen, the police said. He was treated at a trauma center and later released.</p>

<p>Investigators said a gunman in a passing vehicle had fired nine .40-caliber rounds at the 22-year-old, who returned fire.</p>

<p>The 911 callers provided a description of a vehicle they saw fleeing the scene, the police said, and an East Pittsburgh officer saw a similar vehicle, a silver Chevrolet Cruze that appeared to have ballistics damage to its rear window.</p>

<p>“I’m very confident that that was the vehicle involved in the shooting,” Superintendent McDonough said.</p>

<p>The officer stopped the car at 8:40 p.m. and took the driver into custody.</p>

<p>“While he was putting the driver into handcuffs, two other occupants ran from the car,” the Allegheny County police said. An East Pittsburgh officer started shooting, striking the 17-year-old “several times.”</p>

<p>The teenager was taken to U.P.M.C. McKeesport hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:19 p.m., Superintendent McDonough said.</p>

<p>“We believe he was hit three times,” he added. “He was hit in various places on his body.”</p>

<p>The driver of the car was later released after being interviewed.</p>

<p>“At the time we did not feel that charging was called for,” Superintendent McDonough said.</p>

<p>The police are still searching for the second person who ran from the officers. Superintendent McDonough asked that he turn himself in “so that he can give a comprehensive description of what occurred this evening,” the police statement said.</p>

<p>The officer who shot the teenager has been placed on administrative leave, officials said.</p>

<p>Mayor William Peduto of Pittsburgh said in a statement, “This is a devastating situation and I am saddened for Antwon Rose and his family.”</p>

<p>Gisele Barreto Fetterman, whose husband is the mayor of Braddock, Pa., said on Facebook that Antwon had volunteered at the Free Store, an organization she created that gives away surplus and donated items to those in need. When he was 14, she wrote, “and only a few weeks into summer vacation,” he asked about volunteering at the Free Store, and he “was scheduled to return this summer.”</p>

<p>Reached by phone on Wednesday, Ms. Fetterman recalled Antwon’s politeness when he would stop by to help on Saturday mornings. “He would always call me Ms. G or Ma’am,” she said.</p>

<p>Raemon Prunty, 18, a childhood friend of Antwon’s who also volunteered at the Free Store, said he last spoke with him three days ago.</p>

<p>Mr. Prunty said that as an African-American, he, too, would have acted as Antwon did.</p>

<p>“If I was in Antwon’s shoes,” he said, “I would have ran.”</p>

<p>“It’s out of fear,” Mr. Prunty said.</p>

<h2 id="standingbyasprisonersareraped-1">Standing By as Prisoners Are Raped</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Lovisa Stannow</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/opinion/prison-rape-sexual-violence.html </p>

<p>It is well known among prison reformers that the East Mississippi Correctional Facility, a private prison, is a cesspool of violence and sexual abuse. The horrific conditions there have long been out in the open, thanks in large part to a class-action lawsuit brought in 2013 on behalf of the prisoners, on which a judge will rule any day now.</p>

<p>In April, the prison reached a new level of notoriety after a video was released of an inmate being beaten unconscious by other prisoners. The video runs nearly 30 minutes before corrections officers casually enter the frame — negligence made more appalling by the fact that an officer had filmed the attack.</p>

<p>Given the prison’s track record, it would seem like a foregone conclusion that an audit of its efforts to stop rape among prisoners as well as that perpetrated by staff members would turn up scores of problems.</p>

<p>It didn’t.</p>

<p>In 2015, an auditor assessed whether the facility complied with the Prison Rape Elimination Act’s standards — a set of strong federal regulations aimed at ensuring safe ways to report abuse behind bars and improving medical and mental health care in prisons, among other provisions. The picture he painted was at odds with the reality there.</p>

<p>The auditor, a former corrections official himself, declared that the prison “is well managed and staff well trained in their assignments” and that it is “a safe place to serve time.” At an exit meeting with prison management, he praised staff on a job well done, writing that he had “congratulated the facility staff about the progress made in compliance with the P.R.E.A. standards.”</p>

<p>The contrast between that sham audit report and what I have heard from prisoners could not be more dramatic.</p>

<p>Walnut Grove was a private prison in Mississippi that’s been closed that had a history of inmate abuse and was also run by the Management and Training Corporation.</p>

<p>One of the prisoners, a man I’ll call Thomas, has been sexually assaulted numerous times by other prisoners. After one especially brutal attack, he tried to file a report with a prison officer.</p>

<p>“This is prison,” the officer responded. “Stop being gay.”</p>

<p>Anyone paying attention knows that the East Mississippi Correctional Facility is a house of horrors. So what accounts for the profound differences between the facility described in the audit report and the one depicted in the recent video and in accounts from prisoners like Thomas?</p>

<p>The answer cannot be that the auditor happened to visit the facility on two unusually calm days in May 2015, or that he interviewed only inmates who were somehow oblivious to the chaos around them. Even if the plumbing was working on those days and the floors were not soaked with inmates’ blood, the auditor’s job is to examine compliance over the previous 12 months.</p>

<p>Press reports, the federal lawsuit and inmate letters all show that violence and sexual abuse persisted during that time.</p>

<p>A closer look at prior reports by that auditor paints a troubling picture. A year earlier, he had conducted an audit of Walnut Grove Correctional Facility, a Mississippi prison so infamous it recently closed.</p>

<p>Walnut Grove was a private prison run by the Management and Training Corporation, just like the East Mississippi Correctional Facility. The auditor’s report on Walnut Grove mirrored his report on E.M.C.F., declaring it to be “well managed and staff well trained in their assignments” and “a safe place to serve time.”</p>

<p>And as he had done at the East Mississippi prison, the auditor conducted an exit interview where he “congratulated the facility staff on their progress made in compliance with the PREA standards.” This same language is repeated in reports he made in audits of prisons in New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas. These reports are the definition of rubber stamp audits and, as such, antithetical to, and clearly subverting, the intent of the Prison Rape Elimination Act audit process.</p>

<p>He’s not the only auditor who conducts such problematic reviews. An analysis by my organization has found that scores of dangerous prisons are passing their audits with flying colors. These sloppy assessments are a missed opportunity for much needed corrections oversight. Worse, they give cover to cynical officials looking to weasel their way out of accountability for devastating sexual violence.</p>

<p>In fact, the spokesman for Management and Training Corporation has held up the E.M.C.F. audit report as proof that the facility is well run. The prison even has a plaque declaring that it is compliant with the act, which must seem bitterly ironic to the hundreds of men condemned to live there.</p>

<p>The Justice Department is not blind to the serious flaws of these audits. To their credit, officials there released strong audit guidelines last year. But that isn’t enough. The pool of auditors, who have been certified by the Justice Department, is dominated by former corrections officials who are either unable or unwilling to point out deadly practices that are right under their noses.</p>

<p>Equally troubling is the lack of transparency around auditor decertification. It seems that the man who audited the East Mississippi prison had been the go-to auditor of the Management and Training Corporation. He is no longer certified, but the reason why is anyone’s guess. And his pitiful audits still stand as valid.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Congress has an opportunity right now to rectify the problem. On May 22, the House approved the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill that would establish stronger guidelines for conducting an audit and harsher — and more transparent — sanctions for auditors who flout them.</p>

<p>The First Step Act still has to be approved by the Senate, and while it has strong bipartisan support, nothing is guaranteed in today’s political climate.</p>

<p>But one thing is certain: if the audits are allowed to fail, the Prison Rape Elimination Act will fail, and the shameful scourge of prisoner rape will continue.</p>

<h2 id="airlinesaskgovernmentnottousetheirflightstocarrychildrenseparatedattheborder">Airlines Ask Government Not to Use Their Flights to Carry Children Separated at the Border</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Richard Fausset</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/airlines-transport-immigrant-children.html </p>

<p>Saying that it had “no desire to be associated with separating families, or worse, to profit from it,” American Airlines has asked the government to stop using its planes to carry immigrant children taken from their parents.</p>

<p>American Airlines asked the federal government on Wednesday to stop using its commercial planes for “transporting children who have been separated from their families due to the current immigration policy.”</p>

<p>The announcement, which was posted on American’s website, was the latest fallout from the Trump administration’s decision to separate parents who have arrived at the southern border illegally from their children. Soon after American’s announcement, and similar statements by other major airlines, President Trump signed an executive order to end the separation of families and detain parents and children together.</p>

<p>The involvement of the airline industry in the drama showed just how pervasive and passionate the opposition to the original policy had become. Several flight attendants for American, the world’s largest airline, had posted testimony on public and private social media channels in recent days, describing how they had seen groups of Latino children on domestic flights, accompanied not by parents but by federal agents.</p>

<p>In a tweet Wednesday, Frontier Airlines stated that it would “not knowingly allow our flights to be used to transport migrant children away from their families.” United Airlines said it had told federal officials that they “should not transport immigrant children” who had been separated from their parents. Southwest Airlines asked that “anyone” involved in separating children from their parents not fly with them.</p>

<p>A press secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, Tyler Q. Houlton, said it was unfortunate that airlines “no longer want to partner with the brave men and women of D.H.S. to protect the traveling public, combat human trafficking, and to swiftly reunite unaccompanied illegal immigrant children with their families.”</p>

<p>“Despite being provided facts on this issue, these airlines clearly do not understand our immigration laws and the longstanding devastating loopholes that have caused the crisis at our southern border,” Mr. Houlton said.</p>

<p>It is difficult to discern whether the children seen by the American Airlines flight crews were those who had been separated from their parents under the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. Indeed, the airline, in its statement, said that it “has no way to know what kinds of government passengers it transports.”</p>

<p>“While we have carried refugees for nonprofits and the government, many of whom are being reunited with family or friends, we have no knowledge that the federal government has used American to transport children who have been separated from their parents due to the recent immigration policy, but we would be extremely disappointed to learn that is the case,” the statement said.</p>

<p>It continued: “We have therefore requested the federal government to immediately refrain from using American for the purpose of transporting children who have been separated from their families due to the current immigration policy. We have no desire to be associated with separating families, or worse, to profit from it.”</p>

<p>The number of children being moved on domestic flights is unclear. The New York Times contacted media offices of both the Department of Homeland Security and the agency under its jurisdiction, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but only received the statement from Mr. Houlton in response.</p>

<p>The Times also talked to several flight attendants who said they had been disturbed by seeing Latino children on American Airlines flights, accompanied by government agents. But they declined to give their names, for fear of retaliation.</p>

<p>The topic has been a searing one for flight attendants. Sara Nelson is the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines (American’s flight attendants are represented by a different union). In a statement, Ms. Nelson acknowledged that the topic was a heated one among members.</p>

<p>“This national discussion and response is being felt on the planes and discussed among crews,” Ms. Nelson said in a statement. “Some are struggling with the question of participating in a process that they feel deeply is immoral.”</p>

<p>For flight attendants, the mere possibility that they could be involved in a process that is increasing, rather than ameliorating, children’s fears runs counter to one of their core missions. They are regularly entrusted with the care of unaccompanied minors, and take pride in making them feel welcome, many say. Jill Sanders, 51, an American Airlines flight attendant with three decades of experience, said that they were also trained to recognize and report cases of children who might be victims of human trafficking.</p>

<p>“We all can tell at least one story of holding a child while their mother goes to the bathroom on the airplane,” she said, “and know what it’s like when their mother is gone for one minute and 30 seconds.”</p>

<p>Ms. Sanders said she had not personally seen any children who appeared to be migrants separated from their families. But she said she had read several accounts from her colleagues that had been posted on a private Facebook page.</p>

<p>She said that she deemed a number of the posts on the private Facebook page to be “credible and verifiable,” given her personal knowledge of the writers and the details of the flights they described.</p>

<p>“Personally, I cannot imagine how I would justify, in my own mind, my decades-long experience of giving comfort to a child who is upset with being required to participate in the transport of a child away from its mother,” Ms. Sanders said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, a Dallas-based flight attendant named Hunt Palmquist published an essay on the website of The Houston Chronicle.</p>

<p>“Several weeks ago, I worked two flights (one to San Antonio and the other to McAllen) which proved to be two of the most disturbing flights I’ve ever experienced in my career,” wrote Mr. Palmquist, who did not disclose which airline he worked for. “On board these particular flights were ICE agents and migrant children (approximately four to eleven years old) who had been separated from their families and were being flown to a ‘relocation’ site.”</p>

<p>It was not clear how Mr. Palmquist determined that the children were ones who had been separated from their families by the “zero-tolerance” policy. He wrote that a co-worker had been told by immigration agents that children on one flight were part of a soccer team, but that the agents later admitted to the co-worker that “they were, indeed children who were being relocated to assigned camps.”</p>

<p>Mr. Palmquist, who has worked in the airline industry for 29 years, said that he would refuse, in the future, to work on any flight “with children who’ve been separated from their families.”</p>

<p>“Since working the two flights, the images of those helpless children have burned into my psyche. The little children whose faces were full of fear, confusion, sadness and exhaustion left me somewhat traumatized as it occurred to me a few weeks later that I might as well have been a collaborator in their transport.”</p>

<h2 id="firefoxisbackitstimetogiveitatry">Firefox Is Back. It’s Time to Give It a Try.</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/technology/personaltech/firefox-chrome-browser-privacy.html </p>

<p>Minh Uong/The New York Times</p>

<p>Do you ever feel that the web is breaking?</p>

<p>When shopping online for a toaster oven, you can expect an ad for that oven to stalk you from site to site. If you have just a few web browser tabs open, your laptop battery drains rapidly. And don’t get me started on those videos that automatically play when you’re scrolling through a webpage.</p>

<p>The web has reached a new low. It has become an annoying, often toxic and occasionally unsafe place to hang out. More important, it has become an unfair trade: You give up your privacy online, and what you get in return are somewhat convenient services and hyper-targeted ads.</p>

<p>That’s why it may be time to try a different browser. Remember Firefox? The browser, made by the nonprofit Mozilla, emerged in the early 2000s as a faster, better designed vessel to surf the web. But it became irrelevant after Google in 2008 released Chrome, a faster, more secure and versatile browser.</p>

<p>Mozilla recently hit the reset button on Firefox. About two years ago, six Mozilla employees were huddled around a bonfire one night in Santa Cruz, Calif., when they began discussing the state of web browsers. Eventually, they concluded there was a “crisis of confidence” in the web.</p>

<p>“If they don’t trust the web, they won’t use the web,” Mark Mayo, Mozilla’s chief product officer, said in an interview. “That just felt to us like that actually might be the direction we’re going. And so we started to think about tools and architectures and different approaches.”</p>

<p>Now Firefox is back. Mozilla released a new version late last year, code-named Quantum. It is sleekly designed and fast; Mozilla said the revamped Firefox consumes less memory than the competition, meaning you can fire up lots of tabs and browsing will still feel buttery smooth.</p>

<p>Most notably, Firefox now offers privacy tools, like a built-in feature for blocking ad trackers and a “container” that can be installed to prevent Facebook from monitoring your activities across the web. Most other browsers don’t include those features.</p>

<p>After testing Firefox for the last three months, I found it to be on a par with Chrome in most categories. In the end, Firefox’s thoughtful privacy features persuaded me to make the switch and make it my primary browser.</p>

<p>Here’s why you should consider it, too.</p>

<p>Privacy Features</p>

<p>Both Chrome and Firefox support thousands of extensions, which are add-ons that modify your browsing experience. Chrome wins in terms of numbers, with hundreds of thousands of extensions compared with Firefox’s roughly 11,000.</p>

<p>But in months of using Firefox, there wasn’t anything I wanted to do on Chrome that I couldn’t also do on Firefox. Both browsers support 1Password, the popular password-management program. Both support extensions that prevent videos from automatically playing when you visit websites. And both support uBlock Origin, the ad blocker recommended by many security experts.</p>

<p>Mozilla also offers a Firefox extension called Facebook Container. Normally, Facebook can track your browsing activities even outside its social media site by using trackers planted on other websites like web cookies. With Mozilla’s extension, when you open Facebook in a browser tab, it isolates your Facebook identity into its own container, making it difficult for the social network to follow you outside its site.</p>

<p>Firefox especially stood out for some privacy features that are baked into the browser. Inside the privacy settings, you can turn on tracking protection, which blocks online trackers from collecting your browser data across multiple websites. With Chrome, you can install a third-party extension to block trackers — but the fewer add-ons you have to tack onto your browser, the better.</p>

<p>Security experts applauded Mozilla for stepping up its efforts on privacy.</p>

<p>“Firefox does seem to have positioned itself as the privacy-friendly browser, and they have been doing a fantastic job improving security as well,” said Cooper Quintin, a security researcher for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the digital rights nonprofit. “On the other hand, Google is fundamentally an advertising company, so it’s unlikely that they will ever have a business interest in making Chrome more privacy friendly.”</p>

<p>Google said that privacy and security went hand in hand, and that it led the industry on both fronts. The search giant said it had the only browser with a method for reliably addressing Spectre, the security flaw that was revealed this year and that cannot be completely fixed. Spectre affects the microprocessors in nearly all of the world’s computers, and it can allow the theft of information from one application so that it can be shared with another. Chrome also includes a built-in filter that blocks inappropriate, malicious ads from loading.</p>

<p>“You can’t have privacy without security on the web,” said Parisa Tabriz, a director of engineering for Google who specializes in security.</p>

<p>In fact, both Chrome and Firefox have tough security. Both include sandboxing, which isolates processes of the browser so a harmful website doesn’t infect other parts of your machine. So if you loaded a website with malicious code, it would be contained within the webpage so it couldn’t infect your files, webcam and microphone.</p>

<p>Google said there was one thing it could do better on: the inclusion of privacy settings to block tracking technology, similar to the tools that Firefox includes.</p>

<p>“I think that’s something that we can improve on,” Ms. Tabriz said. “Firefox has some settings that we’re also exploring.”</p>

<p>Speed and Battery Tests</p>

<p>Which browser is faster?</p>

<p>Some benchmark websites, which determine the speed of a browser by measuring the responsiveness of different web elements, say Chrome is faster. But some other benchmark sites say Firefox is faster. In my anecdotal testing as someone who juggles more than a dozen web tabs at a time, both were very speedy. Let’s call it a draw.</p>

<p>Mozilla’s promise that Firefox consumes less computer memory raises hopes that it should also use less battery life. Yet in my tests on a laptop running a script that automatically reloaded the top 10 news sites, Firefox lasted only a few minutes longer than Chrome before the battery was depleted. On another test, which involved streaming a Netflix video on a loop on each browser, the battery lasted about 20 minutes longer when the Chrome browser was used.</p>

<p>Resurrection Is Just Beginning</p>

<p>Firefox is the No. 2 computer browser, with about 12 percent of the desktop browser market, lagging far behind Chrome, which has about 67 percent, according to StatCounter. Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Apple’s Safari browsers are even farther behind in the desktop market, with Explorer’s share about 7 percent and Safari’s about 5.5 percent. On Android phones, the Chrome browser is still far more popular than Firefox’s mobile browser. And only lightweight versions of Firefox are available for Apple’s iOS devices.</p>

<p>Yet the path forward for Mozilla looks increasingly promising for consumers.</p>

<p>In addition to the normal Firefox browser, Mozilla offers Firefox Focus, a privacy-centric mobile browser that blocks trackers by default and purges your web browsing history as soon as you close out of a page.</p>

<p>These are privacy-conscious web products that Mozilla is in a position to expand on in the long term. The nonprofit has no direct relationship with advertisers; it gets a small sum from search providers like Google and Bing when a search is conducted through their sites using a Firefox product.</p>

<p>For Mozilla, there’s a plus side to being the underdog.</p>

<p>“The advantage of when you get beaten down is you kind of drop some of your own ego around your decisions,” Mr. Mayo said. “We had a lot less to lose.”</p>

<h2 id="familyseparationssyriadisneyyourwednesdayeveningbriefing">Family Separations, Syria, Disney: Your Wednesday Evening Briefing</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Karen Zraick</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/briefing/family-separations-syria-disney.html </p>

<p>Al Drago for The New York Times</p>

<ol>
<li>“We’ve got to be keeping families together.”</li>
</ol>

<p>In an abrupt reversal, President Trump signed an executive order to end the separation of families at the U.S. border — by indefinitely detaining parents and children together.</p>

<p>But it’s unclear whether the courts will allow that, and the president is likely to face an immediate legal challenge from immigration activists.</p>

<p>The order came amid a full-blown political crisis over the separations, and many kinds of protests. The policy’s most vocal defender, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, was confronted at a Mexican restaurant by chanting critics.</p>

<ol>
<li>The crackdown is sowing turmoil and confusion on the long migrant trail through Central America and Mexico.</li>
</ol>

<p>We sent a reporter to Mexico’s southern border, to talk to Salvadorans and Hondurans making their way north via Guatemala. Many said they were fleeing deadly gang violence, and had few options.</p>

<p>“I want to get to the border,” the father of a 2-year-old said. “Because what else can we do?”</p>

<p>Migrant advocates say the crackdown will only enrich smugglers.</p>

<ol>
<li>A U.N. panel concluded that Syrian government forces and their allies committed war crimes and crimes against humanity when they recaptured a suburb of Damascus from rebels this year.</li>
</ol>

<p>The crimes in eastern Ghouta included the starvation of civilians and indiscriminate bombardments, the report said. But it omitted damning details about chemical attacks that we saw in an earlier, leaked draft of the report.</p>

<ol>
<li>Billions are flying in the bidding war for 21st Century Fox.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disney upped its offer 35 percent, to $71.3 billion, about $6 billion more than Comcast’s, for Rupert Murdoch’s entertainment conglomerate.</p>

<p>At stake are the 20th Century Fox film studio, FX and large stakes in Sky and Star India, among other properties. (Fox News and the Fox broadcast network are not part of the sale.)</p>

<p>MARKET SNAPSHOT View Full Overview</p>

<ol>
<li>Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, is throwing his political clout and personal fortune behind the Democratic campaign to take control of the House.</li>
</ol>

<p>A political independent who has championed left-of-center policies on gun control, immigration and the environment, Mr. Bloomberg will direct at least $80 million into the 2018 election.</p>

<p>The money is likely to undermine Republicans’ financial advantage by bankrolling advertising in a dozen or more congressional districts. Democrats need to gain 23 seats to win a majority.</p>

<ol>
<li>The U.S. is moving more rapidly toward a future in which whites are no longer a majority.</li>
</ol>

<p>A new study found that deaths now outnumber births among white people in more than half of American states, including North Carolina, above. Overall fertility rates plunged after the Great Recession, and mortality rates for non-Hispanic whites have been rising, driven partly by drug overdoses.</p>

<p>But some experts raised the possibility that the numbers are off because some people of mixed race or ethnicity have a fluid sense of identity.</p>

<ol>
<li>Kevin Spacey, who disappeared from Hollywood last fall after allegations of sexual misconduct, is making a return to the screen — of sorts.</li>
</ol>

<p>He plays a supporting role in “Billionaire Boys Club,” which will be released via video on demand next month, and will hit theaters in August. The film, about a group of wealthy boys involved in a Ponzi scheme, stars Ansel Elgort, Emma Roberts, Taron Egerton and Judd Nelson.</p>

<p>It was filmed before the allegations against Mr. Spacey were made public, and the distributor said, “We believe in giving the cast, as well as hundreds of crew members who worked hard on the film, the chance to see their final product reach audiences.”</p>

<ol>
<li>Beginning Sept. 1, the New York Police Department will stop arresting people for smoking marijuana in public. Instead, officers will issue tickets.</li>
</ol>

<p>Marijuana smokers still face arrest if they have an open warrant, are on parole or probation, don’t have identification, have been convicted of a violent crime, or are considered a threat to the public (so no indulging while driving).</p>

<p>Here’s the rundown on the new policy, what prompted the switch, and what other marijuana policy changes might be in store for New Yorkers.</p>

<ol>
<li>At the World Cup, Saudi Arabia avoided another embarrassing shellacking but lost to Uruguay, 1-0. The result eliminated both Saudi Arabia and Egypt from the tournament.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our reporter went to a gastro pub in Sochi, above, that was recommended on the World Cup website. It happens to be in the same building that housed the notorious antidoping laboratory at the center of one of the most elaborate cheating schemes in sports history.</p>

<p>Our reporter found the only allusions to the building’s dark past buried on the extensive cocktail menu. For example: an absinthe-based cocktail called the Meldonium (that’s the banned substance that led to Maria Sharapova’s suspension from tennis).</p>

<ol>
<li>Finally, Thursday is the summer solstice, when the Northern Hemisphere dips toward the sun and bathes in direct sunlight for longer than any other day of the year.</li>
</ol>

<p>The solstice occurs because Earth does not spin upright, but leans 23.5 degrees on a tilted axis. Astronomers have long wondered whether that skew helped create the conditions for life.</p>

<p>It’s a question with growing resonance as researchers study thousands of planets orbiting other stars in the search for Earth 2.0.</p>

<p>Have a great night.</p>

<h2 id="explainingtrumpsexecutiveorderonfamilyseparation">Explaining Trump’s Executive Order on Family Separation</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Charlie Savage</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/us/politics/family-separation-executive-order.html </p>

<p>Immigrant children who are being housed in a tent encampment in Tornillo, Tex. The Trump administration has decided not to try to reunite children and parents who have already been separated.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday sought to quell the uproar over his administration’s systematic separation of immigrant children from their families at the border, signing an executive order he portrayed as ending the problem.</p>

<p>What caused the problem?</p>

<p>Previously, many families caught sneaking across the border — especially those seeking asylum — were released into the United States while their immigration cases were processed. But in April, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that federal prosecutors would now pursue a zero-tolerance policy of criminally prosecuting every adult who illegally crossed the border or tried to do so.</p>

<p>Sending adults to jail for prosecution prompted a set of court-imposed rules stemming from a class-action lawsuit over how the government handled unaccompanied minors in immigration detention. In the Trump administration’s view, the government cannot hold children in immigration detention for over 20 days.</p>

<p>That meant that if adults were sent to jail or long-term indefinite detention while their asylum requests or removal orders were processed, the children could not stay with them. As a result, the Trump policy of prosecuting adults has also led to a practice of separating families and holding children separately while trying to place them with relatives or in a licensed facility.</p>

<p>Did Trump’s order restore the old approach?</p>

<p>No. His order explicitly states that the executive branch will continue to criminally prosecute people who cross the border illegally, signaling that the zero-tolerance policy remains in place.</p>

<p>What does the order change?</p>

<p>The order states that it is now the policy of the Trump administration to keep families together. It appears to envision a system in which families will be housed together in ad hoc detention centers, including on military bases, that the administration hopes a court will approve. It calls for many agencies — including the Pentagon — to make available “existing facilities,” or to construct them, for the Department of Homeland Security to use “for the housing and care of alien families.”</p>

<p>Will this happen right away?</p>

<p>The answer is unclear. At a briefing organized by the White House on Wednesday afternoon, Gene Hamilton, a counselor to Mr. Sessions, sidestepped a question about whether a family that shows up now would be separated. He said that an “implementation phase” would happen but that he was not sure precisely what the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services would do.</p>

<p>Since the administration has concluded that it can detain families together for up to 20 days under the existing rules, the start of the revised policy may turn on how much family-style detention space is available and how many new families are apprehended.</p>

<p>Separately, a Justice Department official said that family separation was prompted in the past when adults were taken into the custody of United States marshals, while children were held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for three days and then transferred to the Health and Human Services Department. Under the new plan, the official said, the entire family will stay in ICE’s hands. While the adults will still be prosecuted, that will prevent the need to immediately separate family members. The administration appears to be hoping that the courts or Congress will change the rules within 20 days, allowing families to be detained together indefinitely.</p>

<p>What does the Flores case have to do with this?</p>

<p>The long-running class-action litigation over the treatment of children in immigration custody ended with a 1997 consent decree known as the Flores settlement. Under it, the government has been obligated to release children from immigration detention to relatives or, if none can be found, to a licensed program within about three to five days. If that is impossible, they must be held in the “least restrictive” setting appropriate to their age and needs.</p>

<p>In the second term of the Obama administration, amid a surge of migrants, the administration adopted a policy of detaining families headed by women together while their cases were processed. After those conditions were challenged in court, Judge Dolly M. Gee of Federal District Court for the Central District of California ruled that the Flores settlement terms also applied to accompanied minors, so holding children with their mothers in indefinite immigration detention was unlawful.</p>

<p>How much can Trump do without court permission?</p>

<p>The most important part of Mr. Trump’s order set in motion a request to get a court to approve holding families together for longer than 20 days. The order directs Mr. Sessions to promptly ask a federal court to “modify” the consent agreement in a manner that would permit the Department of Homeland Security to hold families together throughout immigration court proceedings. At his press briefing, Mr. Hamilton said that unless Congress acted sooner to change the law, it would be up to Judge Gee to decide whether the administration could keep families together.</p>

<p>What happens to the children already separated?</p>

<p>The administration initially said it would not try to reunite children and parents who were separated at the border under the zero-tolerance policy, according to Kenneth Wolfe, a spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department.</p>

<p>But the agency retreated later Wednesday evening, saying that “it is still very early, and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter.”</p>

<p>“Reunification is always the goal,” said Brian Marriott, the senior director of communications for the agency, noting that the department was working toward that for children affected by the president’s policy.</p>

<p>That statement left open the possibility, though, that the children could be reunited with relatives or “appropriate” sponsors in the United States, not necessarily the parent they were separated from at the border.</p>

<p>More than 2,300 children were separated from their parents at the border and placed in government-licensed shelters or in temporary foster care with families across the country.</p>

<p>How do these parents differ from others whose children were removed by the government?</p>

<p>The migrant parents did not lose custody of the children because of poor parenting. “Nobody judged these parents were incapable of taking care of their kids,” said Kay Bellor, a vice president at Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.</p>

<p>Lutheran is one of several nonprofits that have found temporary foster families to care for children separated from their parents at the border. Ms. Bellor said that none of them have been reunited with their parents since the separation.</p>

<p>Was an order even necessary?</p>

<p>No. Mr. Trump likes the flourish of signing executive orders in front of cameras, but most of his have amounted to asking his administration to conduct reviews and come up with proposed solutions to problems, or they have consisted of directives that he could have instead made with a phone call. This is one of those orders.</p>

<p>The Trumps preparing to greet King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain on Tuesday.</p>

<p>You just can’t construct prisons for babies. You can’t rip children from mothers and fathers. You can’t use the power of the American government to institute and oversee a program of state-sponsored child abuse. You can’t have a system where the process and possibility of reunification is murky and maybe futile.</p>

<p>You can’t do any of that and assume that decent people won’t rise up in revolt.</p>

<p>Donald Trump learned that this week as an avalanche of indignation came down on him and his administration for his brutal, inhumane “zero tolerance” policy at the border, which was resulting in the terrible suffering of children and their parents.</p>

<p>Citizens were outraged. Politicians were outraged. Corporate leaders were outraged. Foreign leaders were outraged. The pope was outraged.</p>

<p>This is an immoral act of an immoral man, one who saw absolutely no flaw in using the anguish of children and families — people he viewed as deficient and less-than, “not their best” — as pawns in a political fight to force Congress to fund his ridiculous hate symbol: a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.</p>

<p>He clearly didn’t even think that this was a losing battle for him. He thought using border agents to abduct these children was a winning idea.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, The Associated Press reported: “President Donald Trump sees his hard-line immigration stance as a winning issue heading into a midterm election he views as a referendum on his protectionist policies.”</p>

<p>A Republican member of Congress told CNN that Trump said on Tuesday during a closed-door meeting that “the crying babies doesn’t look good politically.”</p>

<p>Indeed, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS and released Monday found although two-thirds of Americans overall opposed the policy, a majority of Republicans supported it.</p>

<p>Think about that for a second. That to me goes beyond standard political tribalism. That ventures into the territory that the Tennessee Republican senator Bob Corker described last week: This is cultlike.</p>

<p>Trump’s grip on the throat of the Republican Party is so strong that it no longer has breath or voice for objection.</p>

<p>As goes Trump, so goes it.</p>

<p>Not even the sight of devastated families could move the party that once called itself the party of family values. Not even the idea of “tender age” internment camps for babies could move the party built on the protection of “unborn babies.”</p>

<p>The contradiction is abominable.</p>

<p>It’s not that Trump and his family don’t understand the downside of imposing even the smallest amount of stress on children. It’s just that they value different children in differing degrees.</p>

<p>Melania Trump clearly thought that it was too traumatic to move the couple’s young son to Washington during the school year, so she stayed with him in New York, costing taxpayers tens of millions of dollars for security.</p>

<p>As Ms. Trump told Us Weekly in January 2016 about talking to the couple’s son about potentially moving to Washington:</p>

<p>“At that age, it’s hard to explain to them. … I tell him: Take it day by day, enjoy your life, live your meaningful life as I like to do. … Of course, at that age, every child would worry, especially if they love school, if they love friends; they don’t want to lose that. Everything is a new opportunity and it brings new friends and a new school. You never know, you never know what happens. Enjoy it day by day, live your life and don’t stress yourself.”</p>

<p>No, please don’t stress yourself. Stress is for poor people, like immigrants.</p>

<p>Even though, as The New York Times reported, sparing their son from the stress of changing schools and moving from a luxury Manhattan apartment to one of the most famous and important residences in the world cost the New York Police Department an estimated $127,000 to $146,000 a day “to protect the first lady and her son while they reside in Trump Tower.”</p>

<p>Melania Trump didn’t move to the White House until last June.</p>

<p>“A federal spending agreement reached late on Sunday will reimburse New York City for money spent securing U.S. President Donald Trump and his family at Trump Tower in Manhattan.”</p>

<p>Yes, she made an unusual step in publicly condemning the family separation policy, but she did so using her husband’s false “both sides of the aisle” talking point. That was a lie. The president alone started this and had the power to end it.</p>

<p>Then she tweeted this tone-deaf, Marie Antoinette-ish statement, as her husband was still separating children from their parents and sending them to internment camps:</p>

<p>“A great visit with the King &amp; Queen of Spain at the @WhiteHouse today. Queen Letizia &amp; I enjoyed tea &amp; time together focusing on the ways we can positively impact children.”</p>

<p>Enjoyed tea? Positively impact children?</p>

<p>I just can’t.</p>

<p>Now some people are reporting that she quietly pressured her husband behind the scenes to reverse the policy.</p>

<p>Is she or her husband going to visit the child internment camps he created, to see what they wrought and console the crying children there? Is either going to work tirelessly for the swift reunification of every single family that has been torn apart? Will either publicly apologize to the families who were damaged?</p>

<p>Until then, I give her no laurels. Donald and Melania are a team in this terror. They have worked together to make the abhorrent normal. They deserve each other; we deserve better.</p>

<p>Central American asylum seekers being taken into custody by Border Patrol agents near McAllen, Tex., last week.</p>

<p>The Trump administration’s inhumane treatment of immigrant children has left a dark stain on the history of our nation. It is a human tragedy and a threat to our values.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, President Trump signed an executive order rolling back his own policy of separating parents from their children — claiming to solve a problem that was of his own creation.</p>

<p>But this order is no solution at all. It still leaves open the long-term detention of immigrant children, which would clearly violate federal law.</p>

<p>Moreover, you can’t un-abuse the more than 2,300 children who have been separated from their parents at the border with the swipe of a pen. The administration’s family separation policy has already done potentially irreparable harm to those children who were used as pawns in the president’s political agenda. And the order includes no plan to reunite these children with their parents, something that should be done as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The potential toll on these children is heavy. Research shows that the trauma of forced separation can cause long-lasting physical and emotional effects on children, changing how they process information, react to stress and develop executive function and decision-making skills. Such stress could also make these children more prone to inflammation and disease as they grow to be adults. As the number of adverse childhood events increases, the risk of health problems such as obesity, alcoholism and depression later in life increases.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to defend the policy by praising the resilience of refugees this week. But in fact, by separating such young children from their parents, the federal government may have undermined that argument: Research shows that trauma can inhibit the development of resilience.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, the federal government is prohibiting New York from providing health and mental health services to the hundreds of children who have already been placed by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement in centers around the state — even though the state regulates those centers.</p>

<p>The facilities in New York are a testament to the love and compassion of our residents, providing high-quality care and homelike settings that contrast with the terrifying tent city and refurbished Walmart being used to house detainees along the border. But these children shouldn’t be in facilities in New York or anywhere else in the first place. They should be with their parents.</p>

<p>The mistreatment of children seeking refuge within our borders is a moral outrage and an affront to the teachings of every major religion. “All tyranny needs to gain a foothold,” it has been said, “is for people of good conscience to remain silent.”</p>

<p>New York will not remain silent. Our state has always served as a beacon of liberty and opportunity for the world, and the Lady of the Harbor holds her torch high not only to light the way for immigrants, but to light the way forward when our country is lost.</p>

<p>This week, I announced New York State’s intent to file a multiagency lawsuit against the Trump administration to swiftly reunite children with their parents and put an end to the abuse of immigrant families. We fully intend to move forward with this suit to prevent any further harm to the children in custody.</p>

<p>Our case rests primarily on three claims.</p>

<p>First, that holding the children apart from their families is a violation of the constitutional rights of parents to care for, maintain custody of and communicate with their children. These parents are afforded the fundamental right to family integrity under the United States Constitution and under the New York State Constitution. By systematically separating parents from their children, this administration has shown complete disregard for parental rights.</p>

<p>Second, that detaining children — alone or even with their families for an extended period of time — is a violation of the terms of the 1997 Flores settlement agreement with the federal government, which set national standards regarding the detention, release and treatment of children in immigration detention. The settlement, which the administration is seeking to modify, prioritizes the principle of family unity, requires juvenile immigrant detainees to be released within 20 days, and explicitly requires family reunification with a clear preference for parental custody.</p>

<p>Third, we intend to invoke what is known as the “outrageous government conduct doctrine.” In a 1973 case, United States v. Russell, the Supreme Court wrote that it “may someday be presented with a situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction.” That day has come. The callous tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have no place in this country.</p>

<p>We cannot wash away this stain on American history. But we are not without a voice, and will speak up for the voiceless, with words and with action. We will not let what has been done go unanswered, and we will do everything we can to ensure that it never happens again. Together, we can reaffirm our commitment to the fundamental values that built this state and this nation.</p>

<h2 id="willamericalosecanada">Will America Lose Canada?</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Stephen R. Kelly</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-10</p>

<p>President Trump with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada at the Group of 7 meeting last Friday.</p>

<p>DURHAM, N.C. — The worst thing you could say about previous American presidents and their sleepy approach to Canada was that they took their polite northern neighbors for granted.</p>

<p>But as President Trump jetted away from the wreckage of the Group of 7 summit meeting in Quebec this weekend, he plunged American-Canadian relations into a dive so steep it provoked nosebleeds on both sides of the border.</p>

<p>He called the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, dishonest and weak. His advisers accused the Canadians of stabbing Mr. Trump in the back as he winged his way to a meeting with his new best friend, Kim Jong-un of North Korea. And one aide said a “special place in hell” was reserved for Mr. Trudeau, who had the temerity to say to Mr. Trump what the president likes to say to everyone else: Don’t push me around.</p>

<p>It’s not every day you see an American president trade a two-century relationship with a reliable neighbor for what could amount to a one-night stand with a ruthless dictator in Singapore. Mr. Trump may well think bullying Canada is cost-free. After all, three-quarters of its exports go to the United States, which makes retaliation risky for Canada. But having limited options does not mean having none. Reversals like these come with a price, although how and when the United States will pay depends on many factors.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the issue that seemed to have most exercised Mr. Trump: trade. Canada and the United States enjoy the second-largest bilateral trading relationship in the world, second only to America’s total trade with China. But unlike the Chinese, whose largest telecommunications company Mr. Trump is helping to bail out, Canadians actually buy a lot of American products.</p>

<p>Canada has been the top market for American exports for more than two decades, taking more than 18 percent last year. For 35 states, Canada is their largest export market. America does run a trade deficit with Canadians in goods. But when services are added in, the United States had an $8 billion trade surplus with Canada in 2017 — a fact Mr. Trump has bragged he willfully ignored in earlier talks with Mr. Trudeau.</p>

<p>It is therefore strange, especially coming from a man with a business background, that Mr. Trump would treat his best client so shoddily. In addition to his verbal assaults, he has slapped tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum and railed against Canadian policies that protect its dairy and poultry market from foreign competition. And he threatened to slap tariffs on automobiles he said were “flooding” the American market — cars that in most cases contain significant American-made content.</p>

<p>One of the justifications Mr. Trump cited for the steel and aluminum duties was “national security,” which implied that Canada somehow posed a security threat to the United States — the basis for his ill-informed joke about Canada burning down the White House during the War of 1812. This is a stunning assertion.</p>

<p>Besides fighting together in two world wars and Korea, since 1957 Canada and the United States have jointly monitored the skies over North America in the North American Aerospace Defense Command. In the Cold War years, we watched together for Russian bombers. Now it’s mainly North Korean missiles. The United States has no other defense relationship this close.</p>

<p>It has also worked closely with Canada to monitor and secure another of Mr. Trump’s pet concerns, the border. American and Canadian law enforcement officials jointly patrol our shared waterways. Canada and the United States exchange data on border crossers. Canada even permits American customs agents to screen passengers headed for the United States in eight Canadian airports.</p>

<p>When America-bound jumbo jets needed a place to land after the United States closed its airspace on Sept. 11, Canada took them in, an act of unselfish generosity I witnessed while serving at the United States Embassy in Ottawa.</p>

<p>What would a split with Canada look like? Obviously, we’re not talking about anything like a North American Cold War. But even a minor deterioration in the relationship would have significant consequences.</p>

<p>In the short term, Canada seems willing to go toe-to-toe on trade. Canadian officials are already drawing up lists of American exports they will slap with duties. Such tariffs on specific products produced in politically important areas in the United States can inflict a lot of pain. Canada, for example, is the largest market for American agricultural exports.</p>

<p>Longer term, and likely to our detriment, Canada is looking to reduce its dependence on American goods. It already has a free trade agreement with the European Union, for example, something the United States has failed to achieve. Canada also remains part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr. Trump noisily rejected upon taking office. Even Canada’s oil — the country supplies 60 percent of the petroleum the United States now imports — could find more lucrative markets in Asia once needed pipelines are built.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely even Mr. Trump could cause the United States to “lose” Canada, especially since the two are still attached by a 5,525-mile-long border. What we could lose is a quiet habit of friendship and cooperation that has made us safer and more prosperous.</p>

<p>Can Kim Jong-un match that?</p>

<h2 id="whowillleadeuropenow">Who Will Lead Europe Now?</h2>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/opinion/g7-europe-trump-macron-leadership.html </p>

<p>A Russian diplomat said Vladimir Putin’s counterpart, President Emmanuel Macron of France, is now perceived in Russia “as the leader of the Western world.”</p>

<p>PARIS — In a book just published, “The World As It Is,” Barack Obama’s former deputy national security adviser, Ben Rhodes, tells of a tear in Angela Merkel’s eye as she bade farewell to the departing American president for the final time in Berlin on Nov. 17, 2016. Nine days earlier, the election of his successor, Donald J. Trump, had shaken the world. Nowhere had the tremor been felt deeper than in Europe; the German chancellor told Mr. Obama that she saw it as her duty to run for a fourth term because of Mr. Trump. “She’s all alone,” Mr. Obama noted. Someone had to take on the mantle and defend the liberal international order.</p>

<p>Chancellor Merkel ran, barely won and spent the next six months negotiating a governing coalition. In the meantime, in France, Emmanuel Macron won a stunning victory against his far-right opponent, Marine Le Pen. Last month, as President Macron was about to fly to St. Petersburg to meet President Vladimir V. Putin, I asked a Russian diplomat how the French head of state would be perceived in Russia. “As the leader of the Western world,” he replied. Having apparently given up on an American administration they have learned not to trust because of its leader’s unpredictability and the checks, balances and investigations that limit him, the Russians are putting their scorn of Europeans on hold in hopes of finding someone more reliable to talk to.</p>

<p>On Nov. 17, 2016, President Barack Obama, left, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel met for the last time during his presidency in Berlin.</p>

<p>That the “Western world” still exists in the eyes of the Russians is certainly reassuring, since the very existence of the West is now being questioned within the trans-Atlantic community. When the leaders of the G-7 countries (United States, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Japan) gather in Quebec on Friday for their annual meeting, it will be no love feast. Already having shrunk from G-8 after Russia was excluded following the annexation of Crimea in 2014, the group was described last week as the “G-6+1” by Bruno Le Maire, the French finance minister, as he and other European ministers were angrily confronting the American Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, over President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.</p>

<p>But don’t bet on the “G-6” to spearhead a united assault to defend the free world. Italy is now also led by populists and Britain is absorbed in deep soul-searching as it severs its links with the European Union. At a security summit on Asia last week, Singapore’s defense minister, Ng Eng Hen, declined to call Britain “a European power.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you are now,” he added, perplexed.</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of 2018, when we celebrate the centenary of the end of World War I and indulge in nostalgic reminiscence of the popular upheavals of 1968, 50 years ago, while our current international order is in disarray. This may well end up as the year of the awakening of Europe. We will have one man to thank for opening our eyes: Donald J. Trump.</p>

<p>Harsh words have been uttered on both sides of the Atlantic, but the word that sticks most in European capitals these days is “humiliation” — a feeling also shared in Canada. Humiliation, that is, at the hands of your staunchest ally. When President Trump withdraws from the Iranian nuclear deal a few days after the French president and the German chancellor have gone to Washington with a passionate plea to save it, it is humiliating. When he declares tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on grounds of national security, it is insulting. The era when American officials, even at times of disagreement, managed to keep a minimum of civility with their allies is over. President Trump, Mr. Mnuchin and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross are uncannily unpleasant. The ambassadors who represent America are undiplomatic.</p>

<p>Rudeness is this administration’s trademark. No wonder the discussion between the G-7 ministers of finance last week was heated. As a senior French official who sought anonymity for reasons of diplomacy, admitted, “G6+1 does describe a reality.”</p>

<p>What the Europeans are finally starting to understand is that the crisis at hand is not only about bad manners. It is about a fundamental change in the trans-Atlantic relationship. Most likely, it is about the end of the world order as we have known it. The process started well before President Trump’s election, but his predecessor, Mr. Obama, had put such an elegant touch to it that the Europeans were in denial about it, as Ms. Merkel’s tear showed only too well.</p>

<p>“Donald Trump is breaking diplomatic rules and he does not even care,” Claudia Major, an expert with the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told me. “We think he is weird and that after him, it will get better. No! This would be our biggest mistake,” she said. Arnaud Danjean, a French member of the European Parliament, says that many European leaders “would like to go back to the good old days, when the United States was in charge. This is their comfort zone. But it won’t happen.”</p>

<p>A somber mood has fallen on the European foreign policy community, now conscious that this Jacksonian moment for their American partner will outlive Donald Trump. An offhand bit of hyperbole I heard from one French security expert hinted at the level of disappointment: “Would the United States react if Russian tanks rolled into Latvia? I am not even sure. NATO is a dead man walking.”</p>

<p>At the annual conference of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Paris last week, George Soros warned of “an existential danger” for Europe and insisted that Europe “must reinvent itself.” This is what President Macron has been advocating for a year. But as the initial enthusiasm over his election dies down, lengthy pleas for a “strong multilateralism” seem to fall on deaf ears. The young, energetic French president has a lot of admirers but few supporters. “He is our last hope,” a Central European government minister told me, making sure that his comment was “off the record.” It took Ms. Merkel a full nine months to formulate a response to Emmanuel Macron’s proposals to strengthen the European Union. When she finally did, last Sunday in a newspaper interview, her positions were so cautious that one wondered why it had taken her so long. “Still a lot of work to do,” sighed the senior French official.</p>

<p>Yet there is no choice. Neither China nor Russia offer Europe an alternative to the United States. The continent will still maintain a special relationship with Washington, but it must start building its own version of a rule-based international order. It cannot envisage another way of relating to other powers, because the European Union itself is in essence a rule-based regional order.</p>

<p>There are many hurdles along the way. Italy’s new populist leaders will probably be pushing east, toward Mr. Putin. Poland’s populist leaders will be pushing west, toward Mr. Trump. But take notice: none of them wishes to leave the European Union. It is now up to France and Germany to lead together, as they’ve done since shortly after World War II, and up to the northern member states to play a more active role.</p>

<p>Ms. Merkel is finally ready. So let’s move on now.</p>

<h2 id="theg61">The G6+1</h2>

<p>President Trump spoke at the White House on Thursday ahead of the G-7 summit meeting in Quebec.</p>

<p>This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.</p>

<p>A G-7 meeting starts today in a Quebec village, and the United States will be in a position of distinct weakness. The tariffs that President Trump has levied against American allies have, not surprisingly, alienated those allies. In the process, he has handed a gift to China, the main rival to the United States for global supremacy.</p>

<p>“Beijing can’t believe its luck,” Bonnie Glaser of the Center for Strategic and International Studies has written in The Times. “The isolation of the United States serves to reinforce China’s narrative that the United States is an unreliable partner, and it helps advance Beijing’s goals of weakening governance mechanisms like the G-7 that don’t include China.”</p>

<p>As I’ve recommended before, Evan Osnos’s New Yorker piece — “Making China Great Again” — offers the best overview of Trump and China that I’ve read.</p>

<p>Women in media. After my recent column about the shortage of female voices in the media, I heard a fascinating story about the BBC. Ros Atkins, a host there, and Rebecca Bailey, an editor, came up with a policy called 50:50 in 2016 to increase the number of women on a show called “Outside Sources.”</p>

<p>The rule essentially said that 50 percent of all experts appearing on the show should be women. (It exempted subjects of news stories, like members of Parliament, because the show needs to cover the news. It also exempted hosts, because network executives — rather than the show’s producers — choose hosts.)</p>

<p>When the project started, 39 percent of the show’s guests were women, as Atkins wrote for HuffPost. Within three months, the percentage was up to 51 percent. It has remained just over 50 percent since.</p>

<p>The project has also expanded to other BBC shows. “We’re now up to 125 BBC programmes and digital teams and it’s expanding every week,” Atkins wrote to me in an email.</p>

<p>Hard-and-fast rules can have downsides. But I like what the BBC has done. Its rule sets a clear standard — one that doesn’t let the show’s producers get away with making excuses about how hard they’re trying to book women on their show. But the rule also acknowledges that a news show can’t completely control the gender mix of its subjects. Atkins says he welcomes hearing from others interested in trying a version of 50:50. He’s on Twitter, @BBCRosAtkins.</p>

<p>Related: The G-7 meeting and the upcoming North Korea summit are good reasons to mention Foreign Policy Interrupted, a group co-founded by Elmira Bayrasli, a Bard College professor. Its goal is to work with the media and female experts to diversify the public voices on foreign policy. “You solve this problem by creating a pipeline to the media,” Bayrasli told me.

<h2 id="tellthemiwasnotafraid">‘Tell Them I Was Not Afraid’</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Bret Stephens</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-07</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/opinion/germany-fascism-jews-family.html </p>

<p>On Dec. 15, 1941, thousands of Jews were marched to a beach in Liepaja, Latvia, forced to strip, and shot in groups of 10.</p>

<p>HAMBURG, Germany — For years Raya Mazin’s slim memoir sat on my shelf unread, the sort of book familial duty prevents you from throwing out and emotional dread keeps you from reading. Raya’s life had been an eventful one. It began in 1919 in the Latvian port of Liepaja, also known as Libau, and ended in Israel nearly 96 years later. In between came the Holocaust.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I finally took the book down and read it in one sitting. I had a reason. Alexander Gauland, a member of the Bundestag and co-leader of Alternative for Germany (AfD), this country’s third-largest political party, had said in a weekend speech that “Hitler and the Nazis are just a speck of bird shit in over 1,000 years of successful German history.”</p>

<p>I needed to learn anew just what that “speck” had meant for my extended family.</p>

<p>Rachel Westerman — that was Raya’s birth name — was my maternal grandmother’s first cousin; their mothers, born Baskind, were sisters. Her memoir recalls a happy Jewish childhood during Latvia’s independence between the wars. When the Soviets took over in 1940 she was living in Riga, the capital, studying and acting and being wooed by a journalist and playwright named Grisha, her future husband.</p>

<p>The Russian occupation brought midnight arrests and deportations. The Nazis, who invaded the following June, brought mass slaughter and enslavement.</p>

<p>Raya’s father, Shmuel, was arrested along with the other Jewish men on his street in Liepaja on July 14. He “kissed my mother and took his walking stick with him to the jail,” Raya wrote. “Later the men were taken to the lighthouse and shot.”</p>

<p>Raya’s older brother, Abrasha, was arrested on Oct. 1 and murdered about a week later, most likely by Germany’s Latvian henchmen. “Bye, my girl, I hope we meet again,” were his last words to Raya. His wife, Zina, was murdered as well.</p>

<p>Grisha’s entire family — his green-eyed mother, Bella, his older sister, her three children — were murdered in Riga “in the first days of the German occupation.”</p>

<p>Raya’s mother, Haya, and two of her sisters, Becka and Ethel, survived a little longer. On Monday, Dec. 15, 1941, they and thousands of other Jews were taken to the women’s prison in Liepaja. From there, in the freezing cold, they were marched to a nearby beach called Skede, forced to strip to their underclothes, taken to the edge of a trench, made to strip naked, and shot in groups of 10. After three straight days of methodical slaughter, 2,749 Jews — mostly women and children — had perished.</p>

<p>The victims were photographed in their final moments. Gauland may want to celebrate “1,000 years of successful German history,” but all the glories of Goethe or Beethoven crumble to nothingness next to what happened on that beach.</p>

<p>What about Raya? She and Grisha had barely escaped Riga under heavy German fire. They wound up in Samarkand, in what is now Uzbekistan, where he enlisted in the Red Army and was badly wounded in action. In 1945 they were reunited in Riga, and Raya set about discovering what had happened to her family.</p>

<p>One of the handful of Jewish survivors of Liepaja (out of an original population of 6,500) had known Raya’s mother and had tried to help her. “I brought your mother a work certificate attesting that she was working and did not need to go with the rest,” the survivor told Raya.</p>

<p>“I begged her to take the paper, but she told me: ‘I will not take it. My husband is already gone. My sister, Becka, is terrified, and we will go together. Just know that I am not afraid.’ ”</p>

<p>She added this:</p>

<p>“If you meet any of my children, tell them I was not afraid. Tell them to continue living knowing that I was not afraid.”</p>

<p>In 1972, Raya emigrated to Israel, which is where I came to know her. She had taken her mother’s words to heart and had the steady gaze of a woman who feared nothing because she had seen the worst.</p>

<p>The Alexander Gaulands of the world would not have surprised Raya. Every generation has its demagogues to target minorities, extol a mythical past, and minimize or disavow historical crimes. It paves the way for the crimes of the future.</p>

<p>We are witnessing the return of those demagogues today — in the Philippines, Italy, Hungary, Poland, France and the United States. Germany, too. I have come to love this country that has been my home for much of the past year, and I have no patience for the idea that guilt carries over from one generation to the next.</p>

<p>But memory, vigilance, and a sense of responsibility must. For Germans, that requires wiping clean from their Parliament that disgusting speck of avian foulness known as Alternative für Deutschland the next time they go to the polls.</p>

<p>Democratic congressional candidates like Gil Cisneros targeted suburban swing voters in places like City of Industry, Calif.</p>

<p>Democratic politicians and strategists identify a “suburban revolt” against President Trump and right-wing Republican extremism as the key to victory in the 2018 and 2020 elections. They point to Democratic successes in the off-year 2017 elections in Virginia and New Jersey, and the surprise triumph of Senator Doug Jones in Alabama, as evidence for the party’s plan to target college-educated white women, upper-middle-class moderates and even disillusioned conservatives in the affluent suburbs.</p>

<p>In primary contests last week from California to New Jersey, Democrats pursued that “electability” strategy through the “Red to Blue” project of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which targeted suburban swing voters by clearing candidate fields for moderate and conservative Democrats like Gil Cisneros in Orange County and Jeff Van Drew in New Jersey.</p>

<p>The nomination of centrist candidates may bring Democratic gains in the affluent suburbs in the midterms. But the electoral success of that strategy has previously been modest — and more important, the party has paid insufficient attention to the substantial policy costs of turning moderate and affluent suburbs blue. Democrats cannot cater to white swing voters in affluent suburbs and also promote policies that fundamentally challenge income inequality, exclusionary zoning, housing segregation, school inequality, police brutality and mass incarceration.</p>

<p>The political culture of upscale suburbs revolves around resource hoarding of children’s educational advantages, pervasive opposition to economic integration and affordable housing, and the consistent defense of homeowner privileges and taxpayer rights. Indeed, unlike traditional blue-collar Democrats, white-collar professionals across the ideological spectrum — for example, in the high-tech enclaves of California and Northern Virginia, which combined contain eight of the 15 most highly educated congressional districts in the nation — generally endorse tough-on-crime policies, express little interest in protections for unions and sympathize with the economic agenda of Wall Street and Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>In these places, the Democratic suburban strategy of targeting affluent white professionals while appealing to nonwhite voters in diverse, fast-growing communities has had some success. In Virginia’s race for governor last fall, the moderate Democrat Ralph Northam followed the playbook and won 69 percent of the vote in the Northern Virginia suburbs and exurbs, 58 percent statewide from white women with college degrees, 54 percent from those with family incomes above $100,000 and overwhelming support from African-Americans and Latinos. But Mr. Northam secured only 26 percent of ballots cast by white Virginians without a college degree, slightly below even Hillary Clinton’s disastrous nationwide showing.</p>

<p>American suburbia today is far more racially and socioeconomically diverse than these upscale communities. In the largest metropolitan regions, more nonwhite and poor residents now live in suburbs than in central cities, and more than 60 percent of adult suburban residents nationwide are not college-educated professionals. Suburban neighborhoods also remain highly segregated by race and income, and therefore operate as engines of social and economic inequality, the consequence of historical policies of housing and school discrimination and their contemporary legacies like exclusionary zoning, unequal educational opportunity and selective law enforcement.</p>

<p>To explain the realignment of American politics and the migration of working-class whites to the Republican Party, observers usually focus on how politicians from Richard Nixon to Donald Trump have exploited white backlash against racial and cultural liberalism.</p>

<p>The flip side of this is the deliberate, long-term strategy by the Democratic Party to favor the financial interests and social values of affluent white suburban families and high-tech corporations over the priorities of unions and the economic needs of middle-income and poor residents of all races. It’s no coincidence that the bluer that suburban counties turn, the more unequal and economically stratified they become as well — a dynamic evident along Route 128 outside of Boston, in the once solidly Republican suburbs of Connecticut and New Jersey, in boom regions such as Atlanta and Denver, and along the West Coast from Seattle to San Diego.</p>

<p>The party’s suburban strategy emerged during the 1970s to counter Mr. Nixon’s racially charged appeals to “forgotten Americans.” Politicians like Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts campaigned on an agenda of protecting suburban quality of life, getting tough on crime, cutting middle-class taxes and promoting high-tech corporations. These “Atari Democrats,” along with the Democratic Leadership Council and Bill Clinton, played a key role in shifting the party’s center of gravity from industrial unions and working-class voters to high-tech corporations and postindustrial suburban professionals.</p>

<p>The suburban vote has been closely divided since the 1990s. Barack Obama held his final campaign rally in 2008 in an exurb of Northern Virginia and carried a majority of suburban ballots nationwide.</p>

<p>Yet a majority of white suburbanites live in middle-income places such as Macomb County outside Detroit. An electoral strategy that prioritizes high-tech areas and inner-ring suburbs faces daunting demographic math when applied nationwide. It has left liberalism in a historically weak political position.</p>

<p>Modern liberalism offers less and less to the blue-collar suburbs of Detroit, small towns in Pennsylvania and other working-class and once-unionized areas that have experienced the downside of the postindustrial economy and shocked the political system by voting for Mr. Trump. In 2016, Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, endorsed the party’s suburban priorities with the optimistic forecast that “for every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two, three moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia.” (Mrs. Clinton was the first Democratic presidential candidate to lose Pennsylvania since Mr. Dukakis in 1988.)</p>

<p>Democrats haven’t paid enough attention to the substantial policy costs of turning affluent suburbs blue. That focus has failed to reverse the downward mobility of middle-income households and openly favored upscale communities without addressing economic and racial inequality.</p>

<p>The Democratic fixation on upscale white suburbs also distorts policies and diverts resources that could generate higher turnout among nonwhite voting blocs that are crucial to the party’s fortunes and too often taken for granted. It should not be that hard for liberalism to challenge the Republican tax scheme to redistribute income upward, and build on Mr. Obama’s important but inadequate health care reform, with policy solutions that address the real diversity of American suburbia.</p>

<p>That strategy would embrace a broad economic platform promoted by progressives like Elizabeth Warren and Stacey Abrams in her race for governor in Georgia.</p>

<p>Democratic strategists seem unable to understand why Mr. Trump carried the upper Midwest or why Hillary Clinton’s suburban strategy generated such unenthusiastic turnout among nonwhite voters. A political agenda fixated on turning affluent suburbs blue is capable of building neither a stable long-term majority nor a policy blueprint worthy of the progressive mantle.</p>

<h2 id="democratsstrengthenhousetakeoverprospectsinprimaryvoting">Democrats Strengthen House Takeover Prospects in Primary Voting</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Jonathan Martin</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-05</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/us/politics/california-new-jersey-primaries-house.html </p>

<p>Katie Porter, right, a progressive Democrat running for Congress in California, at her election night event in Irvine, Calif., on Tuesday. She advanced to the general election over a more business-oriented Democrat.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON — Democrats enhanced their prospects for winning control of the House with Tuesday’s coast-to-coast primary results, skirting potential calamity in California and lining up likely gains in New Jersey and possible victories in Iowa and New Mexico.</p>

<p>The Democratic Party had feared disaster in California, where a quirky “jungle primary” gives the November ballot to the top two finishers, regardless of party. But Democratic contenders there leveraged financial and strategic help from the national party to weather the winnowing primary, and ensure that they will field candidates in multiple districts that they will most likely need if they are to win control in November.</p>

<p>“Even though Democrats had to spend a few million dollars, crisis averted,” said Nathan Gonzales, a veteran House race handicapper and the editor of the Inside Elections newsletter.</p>

<p>Republicans avoided their own worst-case scenario as well, securing a spot in the California governor’s race, which should help bring G.O.P. voters to the polls this fall to vote for their party’s House candidates. Republicans missed a slot on the ballot to challenge Senator Dianne Feinstein’s re-election bid, but a shutout in both California’s Senate race and its contest for governor could have severely depressed conservative turnout.</p>

<p>Republican voters also chose strong candidates in Southern California for the showdown in November.</p>

<p>The Democrats had more on the line, and more to celebrate. They will be able to mount challenges in places where the party feared being shut out, including open seats near San Diego and Los Angeles and districts represented by Republican incumbents in Orange County, Los Angeles County and around Modesto. Between California and New Jersey, Democrats will contend for at least 10 Republican-held seats, nearly half of the 23 they need for control.</p>

<p>While California was the focal point of Tuesday’s voting, New Jersey was one of a handful of other states where the battle for the House was also joined, including Iowa and New Mexico.</p>

<p>In New Jersey, Democrats settled on well-funded candidates who they believe are likely to prevail in elections for seats being vacated by Representatives Rodney Frelinghuysen and Frank A. LoBiondo. They also intend to mount serious challenges to two incumbents, Leonard Lance and Tom MacArthur, the latter a lawmaker who has closely aligned himself with President Trump.</p>

<p>Supporters and staff of Mike Levin, a Democrat running in California’s 49th congressional district, waiting for primary results on Tuesday in Oceanside, Calif. He appeared to have finished second, allowing him to advance to the general election.</p>

<p>“The results last night not only in California but in New Jersey, Iowa and New Mexico ultimately come down to really strong Democratic candidates getting through with pretty overwhelming support in states where the voters weren’t split among multiple candidates,” said Meredith Kelly, the communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</p>

<p>Republicans saw some positive developments Tuesday as well. In the California governor’s race, John Cox, a Republican, secured a spot on the ballot to face Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor.</p>

<p>In an early-morning tweet Wednesday, Mr. Trump embraced Mr. Cox and tried to counter the widely prevailing view that Democrats had dodged an electoral bullet.</p>

<p>“Great night for Republicans! Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California. He can win,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “So much for the big Blue Wave, it may be a big Red Wave. Working hard!”</p>

<p>In addition, congressional Republicans were enthusiastic about their own contenders in California, including Young Kim, a Korean-American woman who was the top vote-getter in the primary to replace Representative Ed Royce, another retiring Republican in a district that is nearly 30 percent Asian.</p>

<p>“As a businesswoman and a longtime aide to Congressman Ed Royce, Young understands Southern California families’ needs,” said Representative Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.</p>

<p>Another female candidate, Diane Harkey, was the top vote-getter in the San Diego County district being vacated by Representative Darrell Issa.</p>

<p>While Democrats managed to push their candidates through the dicey process, their success in the California races is not guaranteed even though at least seven Republican-held districts in play were carried by Hillary Clinton in 2016. Despite opposition to Mr. Trump, the districts remain dominated by Republican voters. And Democrats did not always get their preferred candidate, with more progressive challengers prevailing in some districts.</p>

<p>For instance, Democratic voters in Orange County picked Katie Porter, a law professor and strong progressive candidate, over the more business-oriented Dave Min to face Representative Mimi Walters, a Republican in her second term, in November. Orange County, south of Los Angeles, is undergoing a demographic transformation as Asian and Latino migrants settle in what was once a pillar of the Ronald Reagan-era Republican Party. But while some suburban voters there may be uneasy with Mr. Trump, the county is hardly a bastion of liberalism.</p>

<p>“I’m not convinced that voters are going to punish Mimi Walters and Dana Rohrabacher because they don’t like the president,” said Mr. Gonzales, referring to two California Republican incumbents at risk.</p>

<p>Democrats, though, vowed to use Ms. Walters’s support for the tax overhaul against her, noting that the cutbacks on mortgage interest and state and local tax deductions had hit many in the affluent district.</p>

<p>“We’re going to go right at Walters for voting to raise taxes on half of the homeowners in her district,” said Sean Clegg, a California-based strategist for Ms. Porter.</p>

<p>Democrats were threatened by an embarrassment of riches in California arising from a strong backlash against Mr. Trump. The environment created a golden opportunity to win a seat in Congress, and the prospect attracted so many contenders in some cases that the party feared the candidates would divide the vote and open the door to Republicans winning the top two slots.</p>

<p>“House Democrats were braced for a rough night in California that would steepen their climb to the majority,” said former Representative Steve Israel, a Democrat who previously ran his party’s House campaign arm. “Instead, they had a good night that further clears their path.”</p>

<p>California Democrats Favor Mainstream House Candidates, Despite Liberal Energy</p>

<p>June 7, 2018</p>

<p>Democratic strategists in Washington deserve some credit for their efforts to knock down the biggest threats in California. In some instances, they picked Democratic candidates who were not supported by Emily’s List, the political action committee that backs women who support abortion rights, and in others they split with the state party. National Democrats also pumped in money to knock down a second-tier Republican, clearing the field for Democrats to fight it out for second place.</p>

<p>“This confirmed that being proactive in these races could yield the results that we wanted,” said Representative Judy Chu, Democrat of California.</p>

<p>For example, the House Majority PAC, the main Democratic “super PAC,” unveiled an advertisement in the last weeks against Scott Baugh, a Republican running in the district represented by Mr. Rohrabacher. The super PAC understood that it could not take out Mr. Rohrabacher, but it needed to make sure the badly divided Democratic candidates would not leave the November ballot open for him.</p>

<p>And in the seat held by Mr. Issa, who is retiring, the House campaign arm recognized that a moderate Republican assemblyman, Rocky Chávez, posed a threat and unleashed an ad campaign that attacked him from the right as part of an attempt to drive his fellow Republicans away from him. It worked: Mr. Chavez appeared likely to finish in sixth place, and Democrats were three of the top four vote-getters in the district.</p>

<p>In the end, the D.C.C.C. and a pair of Democratic political action committees working jointly, the House Majority PAC and Priorities USA Action, spent over $7 million to knock down Republican candidates and lift their own contenders in three districts: Mr. Rohrabacher’s, Mr. Issa’s and Mr. Royce’s. In all three, a second Republican faded in the final results.</p>

<p>At the same time, the D.C.C.C. backed Gil Cisneros over the chosen Emily’s List candidate, Mai Khanh Tran, in Mr. Royce’s district, figuring a Navy veteran and Latino had a better shot than an immigrant pediatrician in a district that has been represented by a Republican for years. Ultimately, three women backed by Emily’s List in targeted districts — Ms. Tran, Virginia Madueño and Sara Jacobs — appeared to have lost to men.</p>

<p>Even if they had been shut out of some of the California contests, Democrats still would have had a national path to winning the two dozen seats needed to take over the House in January. But being frozen out of races in winnable Republican-held districts would have been a major disappointment for Democrats and could have sapped some of the enthusiasm they will need to generate over the coming months.</p>

<p>“Democrats have to be happy and relieved,” said Dave Wasserman, House race analyst for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. “They have woken up from their nightmare of lockouts, and everything is O.K.”</p>

<p>The Democratic success could affect activity in Congress. Faced with the need to protect endangered Republican incumbents in California, House Republican leaders may determine that they have to move forward with a vote on immigration policy being demanded by Republican centrists who believe the issue is critical to their campaigns.</p>

<h2 id="escapesriotsandbeatingsbutstatescantseemtoditchprivateprisons">Escapes, Riots and Beatings. But States Can’t Seem to Ditch Private Prisons.</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-09</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/us/private-prisons-escapes-riots.html </p>

<p>A guard escorted a detainee at a GEO-run prison in Adelanto, Calif. in 2013. The biggest players in the private prison industry, like the GEO Group, tend to spend extensively on lobbying and political contributions.</p>

<p>In Arizona in 2015, a riot broke out in a private prison where previously three inmates had escaped and murdered a vacationing couple.</p>

<p>After order was restored, the state revoked the contract of Management &amp; Training Corporation and hired another private prison firm, the GEO Group.</p>

<p>Three years earlier, the GEO Group had surrendered its contract to run a Mississippi prison after a federal judge ruled that the inmates had not been protected from gang violence. The replacement: Management &amp; Training Corporation.</p>

<p>The staying power of the two companies shows how private prisons maintain their hold on the nation’s criminal justice system despite large-scale failures. The field is dominated by a handful of companies who have swallowed the competition and entrenched their positions through aggressive lawyering, intricate financial arrangements and in some cases, according to lawsuits by the Mississippi attorney general, bribery and kickbacks.</p>

<p>Though a federal review found private prisons are more dangerous than government-run prisons for both guards and inmates, the Trump administration indicated earlier this year that it will expand their use.</p>

<p>Private prison companies can be found at every level of government, housing 9 percent of the nation’s prisoners. They emerged in the 1980s, when the number of inmates was quickly outstripping capacity, and they have an outsize influence in certain states, including Arizona, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi and New Mexico.</p>

<p>Despite hundreds of lawsuits, findings that private prisons save taxpayers little to no money, and evidence of repeated constitutional violations, the number of privately housed inmates has risen faster since 2000 than the overall number of prisoners. In 2016, the number rose by about 1.5 percent, according to Justice Department figures.</p>

<p>Last week, Frank Shaw, a warden for Management &amp; Training, or MTC, at the East Mississippi Correctional Facility, was called to testify in a federal trial claiming that the prison routinely failed to shield inmates from beatings and left them so desperate for medical attention that they lit fires in their cells. Mr. Shaw had also been the warden in Arizona during the riot.</p>

<p>The trial concluded on Monday; the judge has yet to issue a decision.</p>

<p>Even states that have sworn off private prisons, or tried to cut back on their use, have found it difficult to extricate themselves. After the prisoners escaped in Arizona, the state tried to reduce the number of inmates held in that prison. But MTC claimed the state was violating its contract, which guaranteed a certain number of beds would be filled. Arizona had to pay the company $3 million. MTC still operates a facility in the state.</p>

<p>States that use private prisons can find themselves limited to a few big players. The largest are GEO Group, based in Florida; CoreCivic (formerly Corrections Corporation of America), based in Tennessee; and MTC, based in Utah. Two of the past four directors of the Federal Bureau of Prisons were later hired by CoreCivic.</p>

<p>Damage at the state prison in Kingman, Ariz., after inmates rioted in 2015. The facility was run by Management &amp; Training Corporation, a major private prison operator.</p>

<p>George Zoley, chief executive of GEO Group, made $9.6 million in 2017 — almost double his 2016 earnings, according to S.E.C. filings. Damon T. Hininger, CoreCivic’s chief executive, earned $2.3 million in total compensation in 2017, according to the records.</p>

<p>GEO Group and CoreCivic, which are publicly traded, had revenues last year of $2.3 billion and $1.8 billion. Much less is known about MTC, which is privately held. A company spokesman declined to answer a number of emailed questions about its operations and revenues, but said the company was dedicated to helping “at-risk individuals” gain the tools for success.</p>

<p>The companies employ a variety of strategies, including hiring former corrections officials in high-level positions and giving what are sometimes enormous campaign contributions. GEO Group and CoreCivic gave close to half a million dollars to support Mr. Trump’s candidacy and inauguration. After he was elected, their stock prices soared.</p>

<p>Industry officials say they provide cost-effective ways to house inmates, and that they continue to expand into rehabilitation programs as more states seek alternatives to prison. CoreCivic says about 10,000 people in its facilities have obtained high school equivalency diplomas in the past five years, reflecting the company’s efforts to improve the ability of inmates to re-enter society.</p>

<p>But some lawmakers say the claims of cost savings and other benefits do not check out. “There is no convincing argument of why we should have private prisons,” said Mike Fasano, a former Republican state senator from Pasco County, Fla., who voted against a 2012 measure to privatize much of Florida’s prison system.</p>

<p>GEO Group, which did not respond to a request for comment, gave more than $1 million to state candidates and parties in Florida in the two years leading up to the vote, according to data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics. But the proposal was narrowly defeated, Mr. Fasano said, over fears about jeopardizing public safety and hurting public corrections workers, as well as concerns that the promised cost savings would not materialize.</p>

<p>In Mississippi, the state’s three private prisons were once operated by GEO Group and are now run by MTC.</p>

<p>A fourth, Walnut Grove, was closed in 2016, four years after a federal judge wrote that the prison “paints a picture of such horror as should be unrealized anywhere in the civilized world,” and placed the prison under federal oversight.</p>

<p>But the state is still paying for it. In the 1990s, Mississippi issued bonds to pay for prison construction, including some facilities intended to be privately run. It still owes $91 million for Walnut Grove, according to state documents.</p>

<p>In a related case, both companies are being sued by the state attorney general for racketeering in connection with a corruption scandal that led to the conviction of Christopher Epps, a former state corrections director. In 2017, he was sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison after receiving some $1.4 million in bribes and kickbacks from companies vying for state prison contracts.</p>

<p>Cecil McCrory, a former state legislator, was also convicted in the scandal. He did consulting work for both GEO Group and MTC, which paid him $12,000 a month, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>Both companies have denied wrongdoing in the case.</p>

<p>The state declined to settle a separate lawsuit filed on behalf of inmates at the East Mississippi facility by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center. For the past two months, the resulting trial has presented evidence of rampant violence and chronic neglect amid shortages of guards and medical staff. Although four out of five inmates there are mentally ill, East Mississippi has not had a psychiatrist on its staff since November.</p>

<p>Inmates have testified that rival gangs were the prison’s de facto rulers, even deciding which cells new inmates were allowed to occupy. Last year, an inmate with a mobile phone — available on the prison’s black market for $800 — filmed himself beating another inmate and posted the video on Facebook. MTC gives guards less pay and training than government correction officers receive.</p>

<p>Still, Pelicia E. Hall, the state prison commissioner, testified that she had no plans to cut ties to MTC.</p>

<p>Some states have found themselves with few alternatives when they have tried to curb their use of private prisons.</p>

<p>Hawaii, which sends a quarter of its prisoners to a private prison in Eloy, Ariz., sought to bring them home after the murder of two Hawaiian inmates and allegations of abuse in 2010. One inmate had been stabbed 140 times.</p>

<p>Neil Abercrombie, a Democrat who was governor of Hawaii at the time, declared that the policy of sending prisoners away “costs money, it costs lives, it costs communities.” But Hawaii’s largest prison is filled to capacity, so the state has continued to send inmates to Arizona.</p>

<p>Mike Brickner, senior policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio, said the prospects for a privatization plan in his state dimmed after the state sold a prison to a private company and assaults on prison staff and other inmates rose sharply. The frequency of assaults declined in subsequent years.</p>

<p>Much of the industry’s power, critics say, is linked to campaign donations. GEO Group and CoreCivic have given nearly $9 million over the past fifteen years to state candidates and parties across the United States, with the overwhelming majority to Republicans, according to the National Institute on Money in State Politics.</p>

<p>The two companies have also spent between $3 million and $4 million annually on lobbying, according to data from the institute and from the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.</p>

<p>Steve Owen, a CoreCivic spokesman, said the magnitude of lobbying and campaign contributions was not unusual for an industry of its size.</p>

<p>The industry also promises savings. But such claims have been disputed, partly because many contracts allow the private prisons to cherry-pick the healthiest inmates while leaving those who need more care to publicly run facilities, making private prisons appear to be cheaper to run, critics say.</p>

<p>The Justice Department’s inspector general concluded in 2016 that it could not accurately compare costs, partly because of “the different nature of the inmate populations and programs offered in those facilities.”</p>

<p>The department ordered a phasing-out of private facilities that year, saying they “compare poorly” with government prisons and citing a lack of substantial cost savings. One month after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the department rescinded the decision.</p>

<p>Mr. Owen of CoreCivic said his company never insists on terms allowing it to cherry-pick inmates, that its contracts reflect what states want, and that they provide ways for states to withdraw from the arrangement, as some have done.</p>

<p>In some communities, private prisons have become such large taxpayers and employers that backers have forecast economic doom in arguing against their closing.</p>

<p>Perhaps no town is now as dependent as Eloy, Ariz., where four private prisons pay $2 million of the town’s $12.5 million annual operating budget, according to the city manager, Harvey Krauss.</p>

<p>One unit, which houses people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has come under scrutiny for inmate deaths.</p>

<p>In 2015, The Arizona Republic found that at least five people had committed suicide at that facility since 2003, while none of the almost 250 other detention centers across the country had had more than one suicide in that time. Overall, the newspaper reported, 9 percent of all deaths in detention during that period had occurred at the Eloy center.</p>

<p>While there can be a stigma attached to prison towns, the fiscal impact cannot be overstated, Mr. Krauss said.</p>

<p>“We would be in a world of hurt without them,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="insideaprivateprisonbloodsuicideandpoorlypaidguards">Inside a Private Prison: Blood, Suicide and Poorly Paid Guards</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Timothy Williams</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-02</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/mississippi-private-prison-abuse.html </p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. — On the witness stand and under pressure, Frank Shaw, the warden of the East Mississippi Correctional Facility, could not guarantee that the prison was capable of performing its most basic function.</p>

<p>Asked if the guards were supposed to keep inmates in their cells, he said, wearily, “They do their best.”</p>

<p>According to evidence and testimony at a federal civil rights trial, far worse things were happening at the prison than inmates strolling around during a lockdown: A mentally ill man on suicide watch hanged himself, gang members were allowed to beat other prisoners, and those whose cries for medical attention were ignored resorted to setting fires in their cells.</p>

<p>So many shackled men have recounted instances of extraordinary violence and neglect in the prison that the judge has complained of exhaustion.</p>

<p>The case, which has received little attention beyond the local news media, provides a rare glimpse into the cloistered world of privately operated prisons, at a time when the number of state inmates in private facilities is increasing and the Trump administration has indicated that it will expand their use.</p>

<p>Management &amp; Training Corporation, the private company that runs the East Mississippi facility near Meridian in Lauderdale County, already operates two federal prisons and more than 20 facilities around the nation.</p>

<p>The use of private prisons has long been contentious. A 2016 Justice Department report found that they were more violent than government-run institutions for inmates and guards alike, and the Obama administration sought to phase out their use on the federal level. Early last year, President Trump’s attorney general, Jeff Sessions, reversed the ban.</p>

<p>But more than two dozen other states, including Mississippi, contract with privately managed prison companies as a way to reduce costs. Prisons are usually among the most expensive budget items for states.</p>

<p>Since 2000, the number of people housed in privately operated prisons in the nation has increased by 45 percent, while the total number of prisoners has risen by only about 10 percent, according to an analysis by the Sentencing Project.</p>

<p>The genesis of the problems at East Mississippi, according to prisoner advocates, is that the state requires private prisons to operate at 10 percent lower cost than state-run facilities. Even at its state-run institutions, Mississippi spends significantly less on prisoners than most states, a fact that state officials once boasted about.</p>

<p>The federal civil rights lawsuit, filed against the state by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Southern Poverty Law Center after years of complaints from inmates, seeks to force wholesale changes at the prison.</p>

<p>Testimony has described dangerous conditions, confused lines of oversight and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified staff.</p>

<p>Security staff at East Mississippi earn even less than the $12-an-hour starting wage made by their public service counterparts, and private prison guards receive only three weeks of training — less than half the training time required of state prison guards.</p>

<p>The state’s contract with Management &amp; Training Corporation is particularly economical. Mississippi pays the company just $26 a day — or about $9,500 a year — for each minimum-security inmate. That is far less than the $15,000 a year neighboring Alabama spends per inmate, and only 13 percent of what New York, which spends more than any other state, pays per inmate.</p>

<p>Called as an expert witness for the Mississippi inmates, Eldon Vail, the former state prisons chief in Washington State, told the court that the focus on cutting costs had sent East Mississippi into a downward spiral.</p>

<p>“There are not a sufficient number of correctional officers, and most of their problems stem from that issue,” he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Vail said that with too few guards to maintain order, inmates felt compelled to protect themselves with crudely made knives and other weapons, prompting a chain of retaliatory violence. And having too few doctors and nurses meant that inmates with mental illnesses were also more likely to act out violently.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the state and representatives of Management &amp; Training say prisons are meant to be tough environments, and that East Mississippi is no worse than most others.</p>

<p>“We can say — unequivocally — that the facility is safe, secure, clean, and well run,” Issa Arnita, a spokesman for the company, said in a statement released during the trial. “From the warden on down, our staff are trained to treat the men in our care with dignity and respect. Our mission is to help these men make choices in prison and after they’re released that will lead to a new and successful life in society.”</p>

<p>Trial testimony has presented a radically different picture.</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw, the warden — who works for Management &amp; Training, not for the state — receives incentives for staying within budget, but is not penalized when inmates die under questionable circumstances or when fires damage the prison. Four prisoners have died this year.</p>

<p>The warden said that he had been unaware of cases in which inmates had been so badly beaten that they required hospitalization, and that he had not disciplined guards who failed to ensure that inmates were unable to jam door locks and leave their cells.</p>

<p>When Mr. Shaw was asked about the variety of homemade objects used to commit assaults at the prison, he was dismissive. “Inmates have weapons,” he said. “It’s a fact of life.”</p>

<p>Mr. Shaw had previously been warden at an Arizona prison operated by Management &amp; Training, where there was a riot in 2015. A scathing state report determined the riot was sparked by Management &amp; Training’s “culture of disorganization, disengagement and disregard” of “policies and fundamental inmate management and security principles.”</p>

<p>At East Mississippi, the prison designated by the state to hold mentally ill inmates, there was a glaring lack of oversight of inmate care, according to testimony. Four out of five inmates in the prison receive psychiatric medication, but the facility has not had a psychiatrist since November.</p>

<p>The state prison mental health director is not a medical doctor, but a marriage and family therapist. And Gloria Perry, who became the prison system’s chief medical officer in 2008, said that she had never been to the East Mississippi prison.</p>

<p>Pelicia E. Hall, the commissioner of the state prison system, testified that she may have been unaware of many problems at the facility because she did not read weekly performance reports from the state’s own monitor.</p>

<p>In the courtroom, the reports were delivered in person: An inmate testified in tears that a female guard had mocked him when he tried to report being raped in a cell in January. The guard never informed her superiors about the rape.</p>

<p>In an unrelated assault, surveillance video showed an inmate being beaten by other prisoners for 14 minutes before guards arrived.</p>

<p>Neither the state nor the private prison company has contested the accuracy of the prisoners’ accounts heard in court, although lawyers for the state say the stories should be treated with skepticism.</p>

<p>An inmate described another attack that occurred this year. He said a prisoner armed with a knife and a 4-foot section of pipe charged at him while he was being escorted to his cell by two guards. Instead of helping him, he said, the two guards ran away.</p>

<p>The inmate said he was chained at the ankles, waist and wrists at the time. He estimated that the other prisoner assaulted him for three minutes before other guards arrived and pulled the attacker off him.</p>

<p>“They laughed and told him not to do it again,” the inmate said, adding that the same man had beaten him with a pipe the previous month.</p>

<p>At the prison infirmary, he said, the medical staff simply poured distilled water onto his puncture wounds and sent him back to his cell.</p>

<p>“I was in excruciating pain,” he said.</p>

<p>It was not until three days later, the inmate said, when there was blood covering much of the floor of his cell, that he was taken to a hospital. He was treated for four stab wounds and a broken leg.</p>

<p>The inmate testified without giving his name, worried about retaliation from prisoners and guards alike. He said that whatever luck he has had may soon run out: When he went back to prison from the hospital, he said on the stand, he was placed in a cell next to that of his attacker.</p>

<p>Captains Daniel Hall, left, and Vincent Franchino, who are Apache helicopter pilots, leaving the Cadet Chapel at West Point.</p>

<p>Apache helicopters — the kind of aerial weaponry immortalized in Hollywood tough-guy films such as “Rambo” and “Black Hawk Down” — are among the Army’s most revered killing machines, and those who fly them across enemy skies “have an attack mentality,” said Capt. Daniel Hall, a 30-year-old Apache helicopter pilot based at Fort Bliss, in Texas.</p>

<p>“That attack mind-set is shared by the entire Apache community,” Captain Hall said. “It’s a real macho thing.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, Captain Hall was flanked by Capt. Vincent Franchino, a 26-year-old fellow Apache pilot who is also stationed at Fort Bliss, where they are both a part of another community: the group of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender soldiers who serve there.</p>

<p>The couple first met when both were at West Point. Captain Franchino, left, was a plebe and Captain Hall a firstie.</p>

<p>“It’s been a bit of a bumpy road for us,” said Captain Franchino, who married Captain Hall on Jan. 13 in the Cadet Chapel at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y., where they are believed to be the first active-duty, same-sex couple to exchange vows at the legendary Army post.</p>

<p>The Rev. Dawn Sangrey, a Unitarian Universalist minister, performed the ceremony before 150 guests, many in Army service uniforms.</p>

<p>The couple, beaming in their own immaculately pressed blue mess uniforms, the most formal threads in the Army’s wardrobe, were celebrated by a saber-arch salute as they departed the chapel.</p>

<p>“We’ve experienced everything from people feeling awkward around us to being called faggots while holding hands and walking down the street, stuff like that,” said Captain Franchino, who was born and raised in Stony Point, N.Y., the youngest son of Holly Franchino, a retired pharmacist, and Robert Franchino, a retired sergeant with the Police Department in Clarkstown, N.Y.</p>

<p>“But despite what we’ve been through,” Captain Franchino added, “nothing was worse than having served during the ‘don’t ask, don’t tell’ years.”</p>

<p>The emotions and romantic feelings felt by Captains Hall and Franchino, as well as scores of others from the L.G.B.T. military community, were hamstrung by “don’t ask, don’t tell,” a policy that went into effect in October 1993 under President Bill Clinton; it forbade any homosexual or bisexual member of the military from disclosing his or her sexual orientation or from speaking about any homosexual relationships, including marriages.</p>

<p>“Through mutual friends at West Point, we had each learned the other was gay, and though we were attracted to one another, we couldn’t say or do anything about it,” said Captain Hall, who grew up in Chattanooga, Tenn., the only son of Kyle Hall, a middle school mathematics teacher, and Stephen Hall, the vice president for nylon polymer strategic development at Koch Industries in Wichita, Kan., where his parents now live.</p>

<p>“It’s really frustrating when two people have feelings for each other but are not allowed to act on them,” Captain Hall added. “We were serving under a policy that was telling all of us — perfectly capable soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines — to lie about ourselves.”</p>

<p>Captain Franchino said that lying was much better than the alternative.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t tell the truth for fear of what would happen to us,” he said. “So we put it in our minds that we were never going to say we were gay, we were never going to get made fun of, and we were certainly never going to get kicked out of the Army.”</p>

<p>The first time they met was on a Friday afternoon at West Point in August 2009.</p>

<p>Captain Franchino was taking part in an annual tradition during Ring Weekend in which freshmen (known as plebes) get a chance to retaliate against their often overbearing senior cadets (known as firsties) by doing all they can to delay the departure of those seniors, who are trying to hurry home after the ceremony to spend a weekend with their families.</p>

<p>It took Captain Hall, swarmed by plebes, a full hour to cross the final 100 yards to his room. When he got there, he had no idea that four more plebes were waiting patiently to jump out of hiding spots in the room in an effort to scare him and further delay his weekend. After the first three plebes had departed, Captain Hall assumed he was alone, but as he prepared to leave, he was ambushed by Captain Franchino, who had been hiding under the bed.</p>

<p>“When I came out from under the bed, Dan was so startled, he jumped over his desk,” Captain Franchino said, laughing.</p>

<p>Captain Hall said he remembered thinking, “This guy has a lot of guts, and he’s kind of cute too.”</p>

<p>They went their separate ways, though neither veered too far from the other’s line of vision. In January 2010, they selected each other as a partner in a mentorship program that allowed seniors to offer instruction to freshmen who were following similar career paths.</p>

<p>By April of that year, it was clear to their fellow cadets that a spark had been ignited, but under the rules, there could be no flame.</p>

<p>“You could tell that there was this chemistry, this unspoken communication between them,” said Capt. Owen Waits, a close friend to both who was a senior cadet at that time and later married Captain Hall’s sister, Lauren.</p>

<p>“It was kind of strange because you knew that there was this whole aspect of their feelings and personalities that were being suppressed,” Captain Waits said. “But that’s just the way it was.”</p>

<p>But in September 2011, it was that way no longer. Congress repealed “don’t ask, don’t tell,” and Captains Hall and Franchino were soon celebrating their new sense of freedom.</p>

<p>“Vinny came out with a big splash to everyone on Facebook, posting all of these pictures of himself and Dan kissing and hugging, and I thought it was so brave that he did that,” said Captain Franchino’s uncle, Charlie Franchino, of Brooklyn, who is also in a same-sex marriage and was often the shoulder that his nephew leaned on when struggling to keep his sexuality a secret.</p>

<p>Mr. Franchino said he also stepped in to “help ease the shock that was initially felt by Vinny’s parents.”</p>

<p>“My brother’s a cop, he’s a tough guy, and so I knew it wasn’t going to be easy for him and his wife to handle this news,” Mr. Franchino said. “But whatever initial shock they had, they got over it quickly and immediately embraced Dan.”</p>

<p>That evidence was on display during the couple’s reception at the elegant Skylands Manor in Ringwood, N.J., a 44-room Tudor revival mansion perched high in the heavily wooded Ramapo Mountains along a stretch of long and winding country roads snaking through Ringwood State Park.</p>

<p>“Speaking from my heart, I love Dan,” Holly Franchino said during the cocktail hour.</p>

<p>Her husband, Robert Franchino, added of their new son-in-law: “They are two peas in a pod.”</p>

<p>“You can see the chemistry between them,” he added. “Without a doubt, Vinny is absolutely a happier person today than he was before he met Dan.”</p>

<p>The relationship has not always been so accepted or in tune, including beginning with their first date in February 2012 in Washington.</p>

<p>“That’s where some guy called us both faggots,” Captain Franchino said.</p>

<p>But they had a bigger problem to deal with, as Captain Hall, then in flight school at Fort Rucker, in Alabama, learned he was being deployed to South Korea, along with his Boeing AH-64 Apache, a four-blade, twin-turboshaft attack helicopter equipped with a 30-millimeter M230 chain gun, as well as Hellfire missiles and Hydra Rocket Pods.</p>

<p>Upon hearing the news, Captain Franchino was not feeling quite as macho as Captain Hall. Just five months removed from “don’t ask, don’t tell,” the young soldier was on edge.</p>

<p>“I was so worried about Dan, it was really nerve-racking,” Captain Franchino recalled. “At the time, there was just too much pressure involved, we were both very nervous about the long-distance thing, so we both thought it was best to just step away.”</p>

<p>They began dating other people but had a change of heart and got back together in November of that year.</p>

<p>Three years later, their relationship was on more solid ground, so Captain Franchino was in a better place emotionally to hear the news that Captain Hall was being deployed to Kuwait.</p>

<p>A year after that, Captain Hall was flying his Apache above war-torn Iraq.</p>

<p>“We’ve just grown accustomed to being apart at times,” said Captain Franchino, who spent all of 2017 deployed in Germany and several countries in Eastern Europe. “It’s a part of who we are, a part of what we do, so we simply accept it.”</p>

<p>Captain Hall, who said he plans on “leaving the Army after spring,” also said that his military stint, especially the time he spent in the cockpits of Apache helicopters, “has brought a lot of excitement to my life, and so has Vinny.”</p>

<p>But when pressed, Captain Hall refused to say which of the two has brought him more excitement.</p>

<p>“Don’t ask,” he said with a wink and a smile. “I won’t tell.”</p>

<p>On This Day</p>

<p>When Jan. 13, 2018</p>

<p>Where The Cadet Chapel at the United States Military Academy in West Point, N.Y.</p>

<p>The Saber Arch Platoon There were 34 military officers in attendance, and as the couple walked out of the chapel, eight of them split into two columns and raised their swords, forming a military arch for the couple, who now will go by Franchino-Hall.</p>

<h2 id="jeffsessionssendlesswaronmarijuana">Jeff Sessions’s Endless War on Marijuana</h2>

<p id="byline">by: </p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-06</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/jeff-sessionss-war-marijuana.html </p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the White House in December.</p>

<p>The key to understanding the Trump administration’s approach to policy, it seems, is to look at what most Americans want and then imagine the opposite.</p>

<p>Consider the new guidance on marijuana that Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued last week, which reverses Obama-era policy and gives prosecutors more leeway to enforce federal laws against the drug in states where it is legal. Mr. Sessions has been on a lifelong crusade against the plant, which he considers the root of many of society’s ills.</p>

<p>And yet more than six in 10 Americans, and seven in 10 of those under 30, believe marijuana should be legal, twice as many as in 2000. Three-quarters of the public believe the federal government should not prosecute the drug’s sale or use in states where it is legal.</p>

<p>In other words, the new policy is deeply unpopular. Many of its harshest critics are members of the president’s own party, who expressed outrage at the reversal of Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to leave the matter to the states.</p>

<p>Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, where legalized marijuana has spawned a $1 billion industry, threatened to block all nominees to the Justice Department until the new policy is dropped.</p>

<p>Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican, laid the blame at the feet of Mr. Sessions, saying he “betrayed us on this.” A 2014 law co-sponsored by Mr. Rohrabacher prohibits the Justice Department from going after users, growers or sellers of medical marijuana in states where it is legal. The use of recreational marijuana became legal in California on Jan. 1. Even Matt Gaetz, the Florida representative last seen trying to get the special counsel Robert Mueller fired, said the new policy showed Mr. Sessions’s “desire to pursue an antiquated, disproven dogma instead of the will of the American people.”</p>

<p>None of this will bother the attorney general, a lifelong antidrug crusader who runs the Justice Department like it’s 1988, when the war on drugs was at full throttle and the kneejerk political response was to be as punitive as possible. Mr. Sessions has long held a particular enmity for pot, which he continues to demonize. “Good people don’t smoke marijuana,” he said in 2016.</p>

<p>This is wrongheaded for so many reasons. It’s out of step with current knowledge about the risks and benefits of marijuana, which the federal government classified as a Schedule I drug in 1970. By that definition, it has no accepted medical use and is more dangerous than cocaine. Obviously this is outdated, and Congress needs to do its part by removing marijuana from Schedule I. But nothing is stopping Mr. Sessions in the meantime from accepting scientific facts.</p>

<p>The new policy is also blind to the massive cultural shift toward legalization that has been happening at the state level in recent years, after decades of outrageously harsh punishments that have fallen disproportionately on the shoulders of people of color. Eight states have now legalized marijuana for recreational use. California is now the world’s largest legal market for pot. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia allow marijuana to be used for medical purposes. By the end of this year, it is estimated that legal marijuana will be a $9 billion industry.</p>

<p>Finally, to the extent the new policy redirects scarce government resources toward more marijuana prosecutions, it will undermine efforts to address more serious drug problems, like the opioid crisis, an actual public-health emergency that kills tens of thousands of people a year.</p>

<p>The full impact of the Sessions memo isn’t immediately clear. Federal prosecutors are overstretched, and only bring a small number of marijuana prosecutions as it is. But the memo has already created legal uncertainty in states that have partly or fully legalized marijuana, leaving users, growers and sellers to wonder whether their actions will be ignored or will land them behind bars.</p>

<p>Whatever its ultimate impact, the memo is yet another example of how the Justice Department under Jeff Sessions is turning back the clock on smart, evidence-based justice policy. His unwelcome revival of the war on drugs will last at least as long as the attorney general does. It is one of the reasons he has endured the continuing humiliations of working for Donald Trump.</p>
