<h2 id="expertgillettcaseinlimboafterdeathsentenceoverturnedbutthatsnotunusual">Expert: Gillett case in limbo after death sentence overturned, but that's not unusual</h2>

<p>A man whose death row sentence for capital murder was overturned in June 2014 has been waiting four years for a new sentencing hearing — his case apparently forgotten and left collecting dust on a virtual shelf.</p>

<p>And Roger Gillett, convicted of killing two people and transporting their bodies across state lines, is still listed on the Mississippi Department of Corrections as being on death row.</p>

<p>While four years may seem like a long time, it's not all that unusual for a new sentencing hearing to take years to prepare, said Matthew Steffey, a professor of law at the Mississippi College School of Law in Jackson.</p>

<p>"For a defendant to still be going through the legal process 14 years after the date of a death penalty crime is not especially unusual," he said. "This is hardly the oldest death penalty case in America."</p>

<p>However, Steffey said, the longer a case is delayed the harder it is for the prosecution to present its case.</p>

<p>"Witnesses die or become unavailable, evidence becomes lost," he said. "There are all sorts of practical reasons to explain this away."In addition, (Patricia) Burchell was not the district attorney in the original trial, so may need more time to get up to speed on the case," Steffey said.</p>

<p>Gillett, who turned 44 on June 9, and his then-girlfriend, Lisa Jo Chamberlin, 45, killed Gillett's cousin Vernon Hulett, 34, and Hulett's 37-year-old girlfriend, Linda Heintzelman, because the victims would not open a safe. The two were killed in Hulett's Hattiesburg home believed to be around March 19-20, 2004.</p>

<p>The couple's bodies were dismembered and placed in a freezer, which was taken to an abandoned farm in Russell County, Kansas, owned by Gillett's father and where Gillett and Chamberlin were believed to be living after they left Hattiesburg.</p>

<p>Gillett and Chamberlin were arrested in Kansas and extradited to Hattiesburg to await trial in Forrest County.</p>

<p>According to Chamberlin's videotaped confession played at her trial in 2006, Hulett and Heintzelman were beaten and stabbed. Hulett died first. Chamberlin said Gillett suffocated Heintzelman with a plastic bag she gave him after they discovered Heintzelman did not die from her other wounds.</p>

<p>Gillett was tried in 2007. Both were convicted of two counts of capital murder and sentenced to death.</p>

<p>Chamberlin's convictions were vacated in March 2017 by a three-judge panel in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals only to be reviewed six months later by the full court, which decided in March the convictions would stand.</p>

<p>Chamberlin is listed as an inmate at Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County. She is the only female inmate on Mississippi's death row.</p>

<p>Gillett's sentence was vacated on June 12, 2014, by the Mississippi Supreme Court, which upheld his convictions but on the sentence sided with Gillett, who argued the sentence must be set aside if a jury is allowed to consider inadmissible evidence that it otherwise would not have.</p>

<p>"The citizens of the state should be subject to the same protections when there is inadmissible evidence (allowed) to support an aggravator," said Scott Johnson with the Office of Capital Post-Conviction Counsel, in an Associated Press story on the court's decision.</p>

<p>That "inadmissable" evidence was Gillett's attempt to escape from the Kansas jail where he was held after his arrest. It was deemed irrelevant since it did not relate to the actual killings.</p>

<p>A jury must consider a number of factors when deciding whether to sentence someone to death, including the severity of the crime, for instance if it was particularly heinous or committed during another felony such as robbery or rape. Escape or attempted escape may be considered if the capital crime was committed to help the perpetrator escape, but not in Gillett's case.</p>

<p>In the state Supreme Court's 6-3 decision, justices said not every escape is considered a crime of violence under Kansas law. Former Justice Ann Lamar, who wrote the majority opinion, said the Kansas crime cannot be used to support a death sentence in Mississippi.</p>

<p>On Sept. 18, 2014, the court denied the state's motion for rehearing, again remanding the case back to the Forrest County Circuit Court.</p>

<p>In a sentencing hearing, evidence presented at trial must be presented again to a new jury to decided whether Gillett should receive the death penalty or life in prison without parole.</p>

<p>"He doesn't get a second bite at being acquitted," Steffey said.</p>

<p>Since theSupreme Court ruling, no other records appear on the court's website until a letter dated March 21 sent by the court to Johnson, Special Assistant Attorney General Jason Davis with the attorney general's office and Forrest-Perry CountyBurchell, asking for an update on the case's status.</p>

<p>Two letters were returned to the court, filed April 24: one from Johnson, the other from Special Assistant Attorney Cameron Benton.</p>

<p>Johnson in his letter said he is prohibited by law from practicing in any area other than capital post-conviction, so cannot be Gillett's attorney of record.</p>

<p>"Please accept my apology for the delay in responding to your correspondence dated March 21, 2018, regarding the above-referenced matter," he wrote. "I was under the mis-impression that a staff attorney had already answered your inquiry. When the Mississippi Supreme Court entered a decision on June 12, 2014, vacating Mr. Gillett's death sentence, it is my understanding that my representation of him was concluded.</p>

<p>"I say that because it appears that the District Attorney has had (since that date) the option of choosing to have Mr. Gillett sentenced to life without the possibility of parole or placing his case on the active trial docket for purposes of setting a new sentencing hearing."</p>

<p>Johnson was not available for comment. Multiple calls to Kelsey Rushing of the Mississippi Office of the Public Defender's Capital Defense Division were not returned.</p>

<p>Gillett's case, however, appears on an April 19 open docket listed on the public defender's website.</p>

<p>Benton's letter says he contacted Burchell about the resentencing. He said she told him she is "considering all sentencing options and has, indeed, discussed a possible plea with Gillett’s attorney."</p>

<p>"As of this writing, no sentencing date has been set," Benton said in the letter.</p>

<p>A new sentencing hearing would be involved, time consuming and costly, Steffey said. A plea could avoid a new hearing, but that would mean the death penalty would be taken off the table.</p>

<p>"A prosecutor is not going to brag that they've worked out a plea in a former death penalty case," he said. "It may be a resignation to the reality of the situation."</p>

<p>The attorney general's office said the case is in Burchell's hands. Multiple calls to her office were not returned.</p>

<h2 id="thepublichasarighttoknowwhatsrecordedonpolicebodycameras">The public has a right to know what’s recorded on police body cameras</h2>

<p>by: Trey W. Chinn</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-08</p>

<p>url: https://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/story/opinion/columnists/2018/06/10/public-has-right-know-whats-recorded-police-body-cameras/681520002/ </p>

<p>Under a proposed bill in the state Assembly, most footage from police body cameras would be kept from the public. This Milwaukee Police Department footage is from the body camera worn by Dominique Heaggan-Brown and used in his trial. Milwaukee Police Department</p>

<p>Images of 36-year old James Barnett of Laurel that show a bruised and battered face after he says he was attacked by two police officers are startling and heartbreaking. However, they are not unique. All across the country, newspapers and television sets have blasted these graphic pictures across the front pages and into our living rooms.</p>

<p>Most times, we never know the end result. Was the officer reprimanded? What did the investigation prove? Who will be held accountable? What did the body camera footage show?</p>

<p>In the case of Barnett, however, we know the Laurel Police Department fired two police officers accused of brutalizing him. We know that the officers wore body cameras. And we know that the Laurel Police Department has the footage but refuses to release it.</p>

<p>In Mississippi, body cameras are often deployed in a manner that undermines transparency, accountability, and trust. Policies of law enforcement agencies in the Pine Belt fail to provide basic privacy safeguards and bare-minimum accountability provisions.</p>

<p>More: Hattiesburg police 'real pleased' with body cameras</p>

<p>While LPD has a policy for body camera usage, it does not provide clarity on whether officers can view footage prior to submitting their report, how that footage becomes accessible by the public, or whether or not someone’s privacy rights are taken into account.</p>

<p>While LPD’s policy requires that body cameras are activated for all encounters, it does not provide measures for ensuring that the privacy rights of children, domestic violence victims, and people in their homes are protected. Laurel PD’s policy does provide an accountability measure, but only says that failure to follow the policy ‘could’ result in disciplinary action against an officer. Nor does it include any provision for how video can be accessed or if it will be released.</p>

<p>For too long, law enforcement agencies hide behind the assertion of “ongoing investigation” as an exception for releasing body camera footage. Withholding video only increases the level of discord between the community and the police. Law enforcement should not be allowed to abuse their authority in this way.</p>

<p>Having exclusive control over if and when footage is released or refusing to release video altogether of police brutality and police involved shootings and killings, which are disproportionally of black men, serve as an attempt to avoid transparency and accountability. The mere deployment of body cameras makes the statement that police departments believe the actions of officers are a matter of public record. Therefore, these matters are also of public concern. Policies should err on the side of public disclosure, and law enforcement agencies should release footage if consent of those involved is granted.</p>

<p>Dozens of law enforcement agencies are using or considering body cameras. Body cameras, while not a silver bullet to ending police misconduct, can be part of the solution, but only when adopted alongside policies that further the goals of improved policing and strike the right balance of transparency, accountability, and privacy protections.</p>

<p>A memorial to honor two fallen Hattiesburg police officers will be unveiled at 3 p.m. Wednesday at the intersection of Fourth and Ryan streets.</p>

<p>Benjamin J. Deen and Liquori Tate were shot during a traffic stop May 9, 2015, near the memorial site at 514 E. Fourth St. Deen, 34, died at the scene. Tate, 25, died later that evening at a local hospital.</p>

<p>Nine people were charged in connection to their deaths. All but the alleged shooter Marvin Banks are serving time in prison for their crimes. Banks died in a jail cell in December 2015 of apparent heart disease.</p>

<p>The Hattiesburg Housing Authority helped spearhead the memorial effort, with local businesses and residents contributing to the memorial fund.</p>

<p>The memorial will be made of carbon steel and will be a reflection with one side dedicated to Deen and the other to Tate. A path will be built around the memorial and a bench will allow visitors to pause to remember the slain officers.</p>

<p>"Shortly after the shooting, some of the citizens in the community wanted to do something to remember the officers," Assistant Chief Peggy Sealy said in an earlier story. "Officer Deen worked in that area for four years. He was well known by the citizens of that area.</p>

<p>"They felt like they wanted to do something."</p>

<p>The memorial service and unveiling comes days before National Police Week, this year May 13-19. Local officials have a number of events planned for the week.</p>

<p>A new police academy begins Monday with 22 cadets enrolled.</p>

<p>Fuzzy's Tacos will donate a portion of its proceeds Monday to the Hattiesburg Police Department's benevolent fund.</p>

<p>The monthly Coffee with a Cop will begin at 8 a.m. Tuesday at T-Bone’s Records and Cafe.</p>

<p>On Wednesday of Police Week, a private service will be held for the families of local officers who were killed in the line of duty. Flags will be lowered to half-staff that day to honor the fallen officers.</p>

<p>Hattiesburg residents are encouraged to wear blue on Thursday to remember the fallen and honor the officers who work each day in their community.</p>

<p>To wrap up the week's events, there will be a Blue Line Challenge 5K obstacle course race to benefit the HPD Benevolent fund. Register for the race at racesonline.com/events/blue-line-challenge.</p>

<h2 id="republicanpetalmayorhalmarxwillrunforgovernorin2019">Republican Petal Mayor Hal Marx will run for governor in 2019</h2>

<p>The Hattiesburg American news team is constantly working to bring the best news experience to the Pine Belt.</p>

<p>Petal Mayor Hal Marx confirmed Thursday he plans to run for governor in 2019.</p>

<p>"I think the governor's office is really where I need to be as far as being able to accomplish what I would like to see accomplished for the state," he said. "I think my experience as an executive with the city lends itself to the governor's office as chief executive of the state."</p>

<p>The Republican has been mayor since 2009. He said the governor's office is run much like the mayor's office.</p>

<p>"On a municipal scale we handle a lot of the same things you handle on a statewide scale, just a larger scale, obviously," he said. "I think I could make a good representative of the state."</p>

<p>One of things most important to Marx is giving a voice to the voters.</p>

<p>"I would rather have the support of the people than the support if the elite groups that sort of control Jackson right now," he said. "The most important thing is to give a voice to the people that aren't well connected. It seems a lot of the decisions made in Jackson benefit a handful of people that are well connected and the average Mississippian gets overlooked."</p>

<p>For example, Marx said, the state has given millions to big corporations that haven't produced the number of jobs they promised. While not opposed to giving money to help boost the state's economy and bring in more jobs, the policies need to be looked at and used more carefully.</p>

<p>"I think you can get carried away and I think some of the decisions that have been made before haven't always worked out well," he said.</p>

<p>Marx said he has reached out to some grassroots organizations to seek their support and feels he's been well-received.</p>

<p>"I want to change the tone," he said. "I want to give a voice to the people who are not in Jackson. I want to make sure the average Mississippian feels their voice is heard on whatever issue may be coming up at whatever time.</p>

<p>"I want to represent the average person and see if can return the power to the voters instead of the special interest groups."</p>

<p>Petal Alderman at Large William King said he supports Marx's decision and believes the mayor would be a good candidate for governor.</p>

<p>"Hal's been good for the city of Petal," King said. "That's a mighty big step but I think he'll be up for the challenge. Hal comes to the table with a lot of experience."</p>

<p>King said Marx's academic knowledge of government is a plus as well.</p>

<p>"Prior to becoming mayor Hal was a government teacher — that adds to his knowledge in the way government works," King said. "I wish him the best of luck."</p>

<p>Before being elected mayor, he taught social studies at Petal High School from 1998-2009. Marx worked six years as a journalist for a daily newspaper in Laurel before becoming a teacher.</p>

<p>He believes his experience as a teacher can help lead effecting change in the state's ailing educational system.</p>

<p>"I want to find a solution to our education problem in Mississippi," Marx said. "We've been struggling for years and we've tried many different approaches. There's been new fads that have come along from the federal level that filters down to the state.</p>

<p>"I think we need to look beyond just testing and trying to follow a trend. I think we need to go back to some basics in Mississippi. We need to listen to our teachers and get input from them instead of outside consulting groups."</p>

<p>Petal School District was named the top district in the state by the Mississippi Department of Education.</p>

<p>"I think we need to approach this like the city of Petal and the school district," Marx said. "I think there's a lot of things the state can copy from how Petal operates."</p>

<p>The 50-year-old earned a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1991 and a master's of education degree from William Carey University in 2002.</p>

<p>He and his wife, Mindy, have three sons, Brian, Brett, and Nathan. His parents are Harold and Barbara Marx, also of Petal.</p>

<p>Republican Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and Democrat Attorney General Jim Hood also are expected to make a run for governor.</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant is term-limited.</p>

<p>While the Mississippi Republican Party did not specifically talk about Marx as a candidate, Chairman Lucien Smith said he expects to see a sizable pool of candidates in next year's race.</p>

<p>“Mississippi Republicans have a deep bench of conservatives, and I’m confident the voters will have a slate of strong conservative candidates after next year’s primary,” he said in an email.</p>

<p>Requests for comment from the Mississippi Tea Party were not immediately returned.</p>

<h2 id="mississippiwomentacklefootballinhattiesburg">Mississippi women tackle football in Hattiesburg</h2>

<p>Around two dozen Mississippi women have been working out and working hard since June to prepare for their Women's Football Alliance debut this weekend.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Royalty will take on the Alabama Fire in Birmingham on Saturday. Its first home game will be at 7 p.m. May 12 at Petal High School's stadium. Tickets are $7 adults, $5 children, available at the door.</p>

<p>WFA is a full-tackle, professional football league with more than 60 teams nationwide.</p>

<p>Based in Hattiesburg, Mississippi Royalty is the first Mississippi team to play in the league.</p>

<p>Team members come from the Hattiesburg, Jackson, Gulf Coast and McComb areas to practice each week. They say they are looking forward to their professional football debut.</p>

<p>"We're ready," said Regena Jackson, 29, of Jackson. "I'm looking forward to seeing how everybody does and reacts to it. I want to see who's going to hold up on their end."</p>

<p>"I'm looking forward to the competition, the atmosphere," said Lashonda Griffin, 34, of Ridgeland. "I'll give it all I have. I'm getting excited to get that first play out of the way,"</p>

<p>Jackson joined the Royalty last year when a friend encouraged her to play on the team.</p>

<p>"I kind of got drug along," she said. "I thought I would come to practice and try it out and if I liked it I would stay."</p>

<p>Like it she did, so she stayed and is now a receiver for the team.</p>

<p>"I like the fact that I can be aggressive," she said. "It's really not what I thought it would be. "It's a lot better than what I anticipated. Our coach is the bomb."</p>

<p>Story continues below photo gallery.</p>

<p>Three team members are Hattiesburg police officers: Tamica Hill, Lashaundra Buckhalter and Jazz Hoadley. The team's kicker is Lachan Terrell, sister of Hattiesburg High kicker Kendyl Terrell.</p>

<p>Tiffany Spencer, 37, of Pass Christian is an experienced player. She started searching around four years ago for contact sports to play in the area and found a team in New Orleans.</p>

<p>"I wanted to find a contact sport to release some stress and energy," she said. "It's fun. I always wanted to play football, by my mama never wanted me to play with the boys."</p>

<p>Griffin, who plays at wide receiver and cornerback, is another experienced player. She played on a team in Arkansas before joining the Royalty.</p>

<p>"I heard Mississippi was bringing a team to Hattiesburg and I wanted to play in my home state," she said. "The practices have been great. We have a great coach — he is very hands-on, teaching us different techniques in tackle and running.</p>

<p>"It's different to watch (football) on TV. It's totally different when you put your helmet and pads on."</p>

<p>Spencer joined the Louisiana Jazz, which folded, and later played for the New Orleans Krewe.</p>

<p>"I always wanted Mississippi to get a team, and now we've got one," she said.</p>

<p>Spencer said she is looking forward to Saturday's game.</p>

<p>"I think we're going to do real good," she said. "We're going to make a statement. We have a lot of speed — there's a lot of athletes on the team. We're not going to be a pushover."</p>

<p>Griffin traveled from Mississippi to Arkansas to play football because she really enjoyed it, but having a team in Mississippi was especially welcome.</p>

<p>"I first was interested in playing flag football, but I always wanted to play tackle with the boys in middle school," she said.</p>

<p>The team practices at San Antonio Field in Hattiesburg on Tuesday nights and Saturday mornings. Team members are responsible for their own workouts during the week.</p>

<p>Royalty owner Tyre Brown said she previously started a flag football team after Tracy Wolverton of Laurel invited her to coach flag football.</p>

<p>"I didn't have a clue about what I was doing," Brown said. "I knew I would be better on the administrative side," Brown said.</p>

<p>When the flag football team played another team she was intrigued by how her team's opponents played. She learned the women also played tackle football.</p>

<p>"I saw a difference in the way they played football," Brown said. I asked the coach about it — the ladies were not afraid of contact."</p>

<p>That is when Brown decided to start a WFA team in Mississippi. She hopes to create a few more teams that will become the feeders for the Royalty, which she hopes will one day become a Division 1 team.</p>

<p>"I want people to see that Title IX is in existence here in Mississippi," Brown said. "There are equal rights for women to be able to play. There are several women on this team who have always desired to play football, but were told 'no.' Now they have that opportunity to live that dream."</p>

<p>Title IX is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity. While the WFA is a nonprofit organization that does not receive federal funds, Brown said the team will show there is equity for women in the state.</p>

<p>"This is also something that is going to unify our women to let them know that they can accomplish whatever they want," Brown said. "We struggle as women with outside barriers. To bring it here with women, maybe this can be an outlet for them."</p>

<p>One of the team's strengths is its offense, Brown said. "And we have an A-1 kicker."</p>

<p>"Everything is around your quarterback, I feel like we have an A-1 quarterback," she said.</p>

<p>Royalty players also work together to help each other and offer support.</p>

<p>"We're a team," Brown said. "We believe in family."</p>

<p>Team captain Dana Chapman of Hattiesburg said when asked to be on the team, she jumped at the opportunity.</p>

<p>"I love football," she said.</p>

<p>At first, some of the players were apprehensive about playing full tackle, Chapman said.</p>

<p>"Everybody was kind of skeptical about it," she said. "As far as not wanting to get hurt and how rough it was. Our main concern is we want everyone to know we're going to be as safe as we can on the field."</p>

<p>Chapman said she makes sure the players work out together whenever possible and that they are prepared to practice.</p>

<p>"We work really hard to gain good team rapport," she said. "We come together as a family on and off the field. It's been a great experience getting to know (the team members)."</p>

<p>The one area where the team struggles is getting everyone to practices since many players come from outside the Pine Belt.</p>

<p>Brown hired Anthony Dunn about two months ago to lead the coaching staff and believes his leadership has created a winning team.</p>

<p>"He totally turned our team around," Brown said. "His philosophy is fundamentals and safety first.</p>

<p>"He feels that if you are a fundamental, sound football player you will be productive. That is one thing Anthony and I share."</p>

<p>Dunn, who has been involved with football since he was 6, said coaching a women's team is a different experience for him.</p>

<p>"Ladies are different than guys, that's for sure," he said. "They grasp it faster. They ask legitimate questions — questions about learning the game."</p>

<p>Dunn said the women also are focused on doing their best.</p>

<p>"They're ambitious," he said. "There is no big reward for them playing (football) in a sense, so they are just putting everything into it with a sincere heart.</p>

<p>"They're not trying to showboat for anybody."</p>

<p>Team manager Tiffany Johnson of Bassfield makes sure the team stays on track, checking on injured players, ensuring they have proper supplies and equipment and working out issues to keep team operations running smoothly.</p>

<p>She also manages logistics for visiting teams and serves as the team's point of contact.</p>

<p>"I didn't really want to play, but wanted to be part of the team," she said.</p>

<p>One of the team's sponsors, Lil Jackie's Towing, has helped the team with donations, equipment and more. Other businesses that have helped the team include Izote and Purple Parrot Seafood and Steaks.</p>

<p>Lil Jackie's owners Angie and Jackie Terry of Oak Grove hosted a crawfish boil for the team and took them to see another WFA game so they could get a feel for how the games are played.</p>

<p>"This is our first year, so of course, whatever they need, we do," Angie Terry said.</p>

<p>She said she never liked football until she met the Royalty since her father was heavy into football in her youth.</p>

<p>"We never went on family trips because Dad had the football, so I despised football my whole life," Angie said. "But when it came to the women doing it, it was a whole new light," Angie said. "I'm a firm believer in 'what boys can do, girls can do better.'"</p>

<p>Brown said she appreciates the Terrys' support.</p>

<p>"They were the first ones to believe in us and give us a chance," she said. "They have just been a blessing to Mississippi Royalty."</p>

<p>The families of slain Hattiesburg police officers Benjamin J. Deen and Liquori Tate were presented with their service revolvers on Friday, April 20, 2018.</p>

<p>It was a bittersweet moment for Robin Deen and Youlander Ross as they were surrounded by a sea of blue uniforms at the Hattiesburg Police Department's annual awards ceremony, nearly three years after the men were fatally shot during a traffic stop May 9, 2015.</p>

<p>Deen and Ross were among the family members of slain officers Liquori Tate, 25, and Benjamin J. Deen, 34, presented with their loved ones' service weapons Friday at the ceremony at Hattiesburg Police Academy.</p>

<p>"I want to present this to you as a token of appreciation," Chief Anthony Parker told the families. "I can't say enough about the sacrifice you and your family have made."</p>

<p>He quoted John 15:13: Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one's life for one's friends.</p>

<p>The presentations also came a month after the final two of nine suspects pleaded guilty to their roles in the officers' deaths.</p>

<p>The purchase of the handguns for $1 each by the Hattiesburg Police Department's Benevolent Association was approved unanimously by the Hattiesburg City Council during its regular meeting Feb. 6.</p>

<p>Mississippi law allows the service weapon of a law enforcement officer who retires or is killed in the line of duty to be purchased then given to the officer's family.</p>

<p>Hattiesburg police officer David Wynn II, center, was named the 2017 Officer of the Year. He is pictured with Chief Anthony Parker and Assistant Chief Peggy Sealy.</p>

<p>During the ceremony, officers were awarded for years of service with the department and for reaching other milestones.</p>

<p>Some of the awards given Friday included Officer of the Year, presented to David Wynn II and Civilian Employee of the Year, given to Whitney Harper.</p>

<p>Among the reasons Wynn was chosen, he helped recover stolen property and arrested a suspect in a burglary on Mississippi 42 in April 2017. In July, Wynn was off-duty when he noticed two men either installing or removing a card-skimming device at a Hattiesburg gas station.</p>

<p>The suspects and the vehicle were wanted for similar crimes in multiple states, Maj. Hardy Sims said.</p>

<p>Because of his efforts, the men were arrested. They pleaded guilty and were sentenced to federal prison.</p>

<p>"He stopped a big crime ring from the Southeast," Sims said.</p>

<p>Wynn also was responsible for helping stop an active-shooter situation that took place in September outside a Hattiesburg nightclub.</p>

<p>"Officer Wynn was able to get into a position to return fire on the suspect, striking him once," Sims said. "Officer Wynn's response without hesitation was instrumental in the apprehension of the suspect and kept him from injuring other officers and civilians."</p>

<p>Whitney Harper, pictured with Hattiesburg Police Chief Anthony Parker and Assistant Chief Peggy Sealy, was presented the Civilian of the Year Award for 2017.</p>

<p>Harper works as a victims' advocate with Hattiesburg Municipal Court.</p>

<p>"She shows excellence in caring for victims of domestic violence and is also willing to go the extra mile to make sure their needs are met," Sims said.</p>

<p>A trial date has been set for April 10 at William M. Colmer Federal Courthouse for a brutality case involving two Hattiesburg police officers.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs George L. Wade Jr. and the estate of the late George Wade Sr. were seeking $7.5 million in the case against then-HPD officers Demetrius Breland and Narottam Holden, claiming they used unreasonable force when responding to a domestic call on April 16, 2013.</p>

<p>The defendants deny any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Clark Hicks, the attorney representing the city in the lawsuit, said in an earlier story the Wades' claims are without merit.</p>

<p>“When the police were called, the Wades were extremely combative and belligerent,” he said. “The Hattiesburg police officers used reasonable force."</p>

<p>In December, U.S. District Judge Keith Starrett dismissed the Wades' case without prejudice.</p>

<p>"The only evidence of the force used against Wade Jr. before the court is Breland’s deposition testimony and incident report," Starrett said in his order dismissing the case. "Therefore this is the version of events that the court must use in order to determine if Breland used an excessive amount of force."</p>

<p>Starrett subsequently reinstated the case.</p>

<p>The Wades' attorney, Ottowa Carter, filed a motion for reconsideration, saying Wade Jr.'s deposition is in the Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, so Breland's testimony is not the only testimony on record.</p>

<p>Starrett agreed, but ruled only Wade Jr.'s excessive force claim will be reinstated.</p>

<p>"The narrative given by Wade Jr. does present a factual dispute as to whether Breland's use of force was reasonable," Starrett wrote in his order reinstating the case.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Wade Jr. and his wife, Susan, were having an argument. Their son joined in the fight.</p>

<p>The Wades say when Breland arrived at the family home, he was talking to Susan Wade when he "suddenly and without warning" kicked Wade Jr.'s leg, threw him on the ground, rubbed his face against the asphalt and handcuffed him.</p>

<p>Wade Jr. said Breland's actions caused his leg and foot to be broken. Wade Jr. also claims Breland kicked him in the groin area as he was placed in a patrol car.</p>

<p>Wade Sr., a retired police officer, allegedly saw Breland beating his son. He showed his badge to Breland, telling him he "was not treating his son right."</p>

<p>Breland is accused of pepper-spraying Wade Sr. then beating the 73-year-old when he went in the house to wash the pepper spray off his face. The officer allegedly pulled his gun on Susan and her daughter as they tried to help Wade Sr.</p>

<p>Susan again called Hattiesburg police, allegedly telling the dispatcher she feared Breland would kill Wade Sr.</p>

<p>Officer Holden and an unnamed female officer arrived at the Wade home, where Holden allegedly joined Breland in beating Wade Sr., according to the Wades' suit.</p>

<p>The female Wades said in the suit "they could hear (Wade Sr.) making sounds that were indicative of a person being subjected to a beating."</p>

<p>"As a result of this brutal and unlawful treatment, George Sr. suffered a concussion, fractured vertebrae, 10 stitches to his left eye, a burst blood vessel in his eye, a bruised shoulder, back, ribs and arms, and contusions (knots) on his head," the lawsuit claims.</p>

<p>A former Hattiesburg police officer was sentenced Monday to 61 months in federal prison and a $1,500 fine for attempted possession of 50 kilograms or more of marijuana with the intent to distribute, Mississippi U.S. Attorney Mike Hurst and Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Christopher Freeze said Tuesday.</p>

<p>Thomas Wheeler, 33, pleaded in guilty to the charge in December before U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate in federal court in Jackson. Wingate also presided over his sentencing.</p>

<p>Wheeler initially was charged with two drug-related charges, but he pleaded only to the lesser charge.</p>

<p>Wheeler was arrested after another man, Elijah Moore, was stopped on Interstate 20 in Warren County by a Mississippi Highway Patrol trooper on Aug. 8, 2015.</p>

<p>After observing suspicious activity, a police dog was walked around the vehicle and alerted on the truck, officials said in a Department of Justice news release.</p>

<p>When troopers searched the vehicle, they found eight duffle bags containing bricks of marijuana.</p>

<p>Moore said he picked up the marijuana from El Paso, Texas, and brought it to Mississippi to sell.</p>

<p>He told officers he was meeting Wheeler, his grandson, who agreed to take the marijuana to Seminary for Moore to pick up at a later date.</p>

<p>While investigating Moore's traffic stop, officers saw a maroon Chevrolet SUV with a Covington County license plate parked on the off-ramp on which Moore’s truck was stopped. They saw the SUV leave the area heading toward Jackson.</p>

<p>The SUV was stopped later. Wheeler was the only occupant in the vehicle. He corroborated Moore's story. In addition, Wheeler told officers he had picked up another load of marijuana previously for which he paid Moore $3,000.</p>

<p>Wheeler was off-duty at the time of his arrest.</p>

<p>Moore pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute marijuana and was sentenced March 2, 2017, to 97 months in federal prison and a $1,500 fine.</p>

<p>The case was investigated by the FBI’s Southeast Mississippi Safe Streets Task Force in Hattiesburg, which is made up of special agents from the FBI and law enforcement officers from the Office of the Mississippi State Auditor, Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics and Hattiesburg Police Department, with assistance from the Mississippi Highway Patrol and Pearl Police Department.</p>

<p>Southern Miss busted out of a three-game slump in the nightcap of Saturday’s home doubleheader, completing the three-game sweep of Georgia Southern with an 8-2 win.</p>

<p>The 16th-ranked Golden Eagles, who did all their scoring in the third, fourth and fifth innings, had managed just seven runs over the previous three games combined. Scott Berry’s club defeated the Eagles in the first two contests of the series in walk-off fashion.</p>

<p>Southern Miss (11-4) is back in action at Tulane at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday, before opening Conference USA play at 6 p.m. Friday against UTSA.</p>

<p>“I think we’re playing pretty well,” Berry said. “We need to finish non-conference strong before we start season two. The challenge is to play consistently good baseball that allows you a chance to win. We did that for the most part in these three games.”</p>

<p>Cody Carroll gave the Golden Eagles four innings of one-run ball, striking out four and walking two. Georgia Southern pushed a run across in the second inning after a leadoff double, a walk and an RBI single.</p>

<p>Carroll, a sophomore right-hander, admitted starting an inning like that a year ago would have likely spiraled out of control.</p>

<p>“This being my second year, I feel like I’ve definitely grown as a person and a pitcher,” Carroll said. “Having (pitching coach Christian Ostrander) here with us has improved our pitching staff, I think. The big mentality part he brings to the table has instilled in us the ability to grind out tough outings.”</p>

<p>Calder Mikell (1-0), Adam Jackson, Mason Strickland, J.C. Keys and Trent Driver each contributed an inning of relief, allowing only a run on two hits.</p>

<p>In the first game, left-hander Stevie Powers put up a career-high 10 strikeouts over a career-high 6 1/3 innings.</p>

<p>Powers always thought he would play college baseball at Georgia Southern.</p>

<p>Born and raised less than an hour from the Statesboro school, the Southern Miss junior more or less just assumed it was a foregone conclusion he would eventually join the Eagles.</p>

<p>Southern Miss starting pitcher Stevie Powers delivers to the plate Saturday against Georgia Southern.</p>

<p>But they never offered him a scholarship, opting instead to give him an opportunity to walk on to the team. Powers was more interested in joining the Golden Eagles, and in Saturday’s 3-2 win over Georgia Southern (7-9), he showed them what they missed out on.</p>

<p>“My mom went to school there and I grew up near there, so it was a place I thought I’d end up at,” he said. “But obviously the best decision of my life was to come down here. Finally, getting a chance to play against them is a dream come true, really.”</p>

<p>The Golden Eagles went up 1-0 in the third inning against Georgia Southern sophomore starter Seth Shuman, who took the loss for the first time in his collegiate career. But the Eagles struck for two runs in the top of the ninth off relievers Keller Bradford and Jarod Wright.</p>

<p>Southern Miss came back in the bottom half as Luke Reynolds, who extended his hitting streak to eight games earlier in the contest, drew a leadoff walk and came around to score on Matt Wallner’s two-run, opposite field home run – the first of the season for the 2017 National Freshman of the Year.</p>

<p>Southern Miss starting pitcher Stevie Powers, right, offers relief pitcher Keller Bradford words of encouragement during a pitching change Saturday.</p>

<p>The walk-off win is the second in a row for the Golden Eagles over the Eagles.</p>

<p>“That was pretty awesome getting that first one off my back,” said Wallner, who admitted his power shortage through the season’s first 13 games was weighing on his mind. “You try to keep it off (your mind). But it was good to pick the pitchers up for the second time this week. That’s three games in a row they’ve done well.”</p>

<p>When Powers was lifted in the sixth with runners on second and third with one out, Bradford was called upon. He worked out of the jam and gave the team another 1 1/3 innings, allowing just two hits and one run. Left-hander Jacob Weirich (2-0) earned the win by recording two outs with two runners on base in the top of the ninth.</p>

<p>A petition for rehearing filed in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals by the Rev. Kenneth Fairley has been denied.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, his case was remanded to U.S. District Court Mississippi Southern District for Judge Keith Starrett to review.</p>

<p>Fairley, 64, was found guilty by a federal jury in September 2016 of two counts of theft of government funds and one count of conspiracy to defraud the government, involving money received from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development through grants administered by the city of Hattiesburg.</p>

<p>Starrett presided over the trial.</p>

<p>In a 2-1 decision, the appellate judges vacated the theft convictions and remanded sentencing for the conspiracy conviction to the U.S. District Court Mississippi Southern District "to determine whether Fairley's sentence should be changed in light of the vacated convictions."</p>

<p>His attorneys, in the motion for the rehearing, said the error cited for throwing out the other two convictions should be the same for throwing out the third.</p>

<p>"The jury was never given a coherent, accurate, legally acceptable definition of the offense, and this is plain error," wrote Herbert Larson, one of Fairley's attorneys.</p>

<p>"We obviously thought that all three convictions should have been overturned," Larson said in an earlier story. "The distinction (made between the counts by the appellate judges) was a distinction without a difference."</p>

<p>Larson said in the story the legal team will not stop fighting for Fairley.</p>

<p>"It is presently our intention that we will seek relief in U.S. Supreme Court," Larson said.</p>

<p>He could not be reached for comment Friday for this story.</p>

<p>Fairley, senior pastor of Mount Carmel Baptist Church, was sentenced to three years in prison. He was ordered to serve his sentence at the minimum-security Pensacola Federal Prison Camp but later was relocated to the low-security Oakdale Prison in Oakdale, Louisiana.</p>

<p>He has served about a year of his sentence.</p>

<p>Fairley initially faced six charges tied to grant money his nonprofit organization received through a HUD home rehabilitation program. Three of those charges were dropped the first day of trial: two counts of engaging in monetary transactions to criminally derive property and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>

<p>The conspiracy charge stemmed from activity between Fairley and Artie Fletcher, a Picayune businessman who operates a number of businesses in the New Orleans area.</p>

<p>The government proved Fairley and Fletcher entered into an agreement in which Fletcher was contracted to conduct the rehabilitation work but the actual work was subcontracted "to local individuals and companies who attempted to perform the work for a lesser amount."</p>

<p>Pine Belt Community Services, of which Fairley is director, turned in about $38,000 in receipts for two homes it was supposed to rehabilitate using the HUD grants. The homes are located at 202 South St. and 127 E. Fifth St.</p>

<p>Pine Belt Community Services received around $98,000 for the projects, which left around $60,000 unaccounted for.</p>

<p>Fairley was ordered to pay $60,223.95 in restitution and a $30,000 fine. He also was ordered to serve three years of post-release supervision.</p>

<p>Fletcher, who was indicted with Fairley but pleaded guilty to a separate charge of misprision of a felony, was given three years of probation and also ordered to pay $60,223.95 in restitution. The other charges against him were dropped.</p>

<p>Fletcher admitted he had knowledge of a felony and did not make it known to authorities.</p>

<p>On this week's installment of "The LeeBo &amp; Irby Show," the Southern Miss baseball team's co-captains welcome rookie outfielder Gabe Montenegro. Wochit</p>

<p>FRISCO, Texas — Conference USA is playing tournament games two at a time, on opposite sides of a huge black curtain in the facility where the NFL's Dallas Cowboys practice.</p>

<p>This is a unique Texas two-step.</p>

<p>C-USA is believed to be the first NCAA league ever to play such games simultaneously in the same building.</p>

<p>"We're kind of the guinea pig. I don't know if anyone else will try it or not," C-USA commissioner Judy MacLeod said. "We're in a position where we can try some things and take some risks and see what we can build."</p>

<p>The dual-court setup is being used for the first two rounds of the league's men's and women's tournaments. Four teams, four pep bands and plenty of overlapping action on two courts.</p>

<p>More: Southern Miss advances at Conference USA tournament, will face Middle Tennessee Thursday</p>

<p>Blair Reed, a Frisco resident who had never been inside the Ford Center that his tax dollars help build, had a 50-yard line seat Wednesday night. With no specific rooting interest, he sat in a permanent sideline seat directly in line with the curtain that split the building in half, where he could see both courts.</p>

<p>"It is sensory overload in a way, but if you're a student of the game, and you know when to change your focus — free throws, you can look here," Reed said, pointing from Court A on his left to Court B to the right. "Fast break, you want to stay with it. Timeouts, you can change your focus again. That's how I'm doing it right now. I'm enjoying every minute of it."</p>

<p>"Initially, we were just touring the facility and it's such a great facility with the plaza out front, and the hotels and restaurants. We were like, what we can do here," said MacLeod, whose idea for dual courts grew on Cowboys officials. "I think they like to be able to show the flexibility of the arena and the surrounding facilities."</p>

<p>After four women's games on the two courts during the day Wednesday, the men did the same that night. That gets repeated Thursday when the top four seeds on each side play Wednesday's winners.</p>

<p>All of the semifinal games Friday and both championship games Saturday, with NCAA Tournament berths on the line, will be played on the same court.</p>

<p>Southern Miss men's coach Doc Sadler acknowledged being a bit wary at first, not knowing what to expect in the unusual atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Anybody can complain, but I never heard anything from the other side," Sadler said. "The court was well-lit, the environment is close. I thought it was a good setup."</p>

<p>The Golden Eagles get to do it again Thursday, against top seed Middle Tennessee. They advanced after Cortez Edwards scored 29 points a 69-68 win over FIU.</p>

<p>Edwards heard some cheering from the other court during timeouts and deadballs, but that didn't bother him.</p>

<p>"None of that stuff even matters if you're focused," Edwards said.</p>

<p>Brian Beard Jr. had 30 points for FIU, including a 3-pointer with 2:29 left in the first half — at the same time Nick Allen hit a 3 for UTSA as the Roadrunners took an early lead on way to their 71-58 win over UTEP.</p>

<p>The biggest crowd was for the Court A nightcap when North Texas, whose Denton campus is only about 30 miles away, lost 68-62 to Louisiana Tech. There were plenty of green-shirted fans rooting for the local team, along with a smaller but loud contingent from Ruston.</p>

<p>That game ended only minutes before UAB's 83-72 win over Florida Atlantic on the quieter Court B wrapped up the first day.</p>

<p>"Being here for the UTSA-UTEP game, when you're not coaching, I was trying to get a real good sense of that what you hear," Blazers coach Robert Ehsan said. "There was some noise going on on that other court, but it didn't really affect the game at all. ... It's cool and unique to play in a venue like this."</p>

<p>The ninth-seeded Southern Miss men’s basketball team will take on No. 8 FIU in the first round of the Conference USA tournament at 6 p.m. Wednesday.</p>

<p>On the women’s side, the No. 8 Lady Eagles will tip off versus ninth-seeded UTEP at 11 a.m. Wednesday</p>

<p>Both games will be live streamed via Facebook. Ron Thulin, Tim Scarborough and Rachel Lindsay are scheduled as the broadcast team. The tournament is being held at the Ford Center at The Star (the Dallas Cowboys’ practice and training facility) in Frisco, Texas.</p>

<p>Following last week’s win over Louisiana Tech in the regular-season finale, Golden Eagles coach Doc Sadler said his expectation was to win the tournament championship this week.</p>

<p>“But to do that, you’ve got to win one game,” he said. “As I told the team, I don’t know who it’s going to be, but at this time a week from now, there’s going to be a team nobody expected to be in this thing.

<p>Court documents detail key components in an alleged pharmacy insurance fraud scheme.</p>

<p>Buy Photo</p>

<p>Former pharmaceuticals sales rep Jay Schaar was the last person to take the stand Tuesday in the trial of Dr. Albert Diaz, a Coast doctor charged with 16 counts in connection to a scheme officials say defrauded TRICARE and other health care providers by prescribing medically unnecessary compounds.</p>

<p>The trial began Monday at William M. Colmer Federal Courthouse in Hattiesburg.</p>

<p>Schaar testified Diaz, whose medical practice is in Biloxi, wrote prescriptions without examining patients who lived in Hattiesburg and had the prescriptions filled by Hattiesburg-based Advantage Pharmacy for nearly $3.4 million between March 2011 and March 2015.</p>

<p>More than $2.3 million of that money was reimbursed to the pharmacy by TRICARE, a health care benefit program for the military, veterans and their family members.</p>

<p>Diaz also allegedly submitted false patient records for an audit for TRICARE and indicated he had examined his patients before prescribing them compounded medications. Schaar testified the patient records were obtained long after Diaz wrote the prescriptions.</p>

<p>Compounded drugs are the mixture of two or more drugs by a pharmacist to meet a patient’s specific needs.</p>

<p>Diaz of Ocean Springs, an obstetrician and gynecologist, was indicted in October.</p>

<p>Even though ob/gyn doctors specialize in treating female patients, Diaz allegedly wrote prescriptions for compounded pain creams and pills to several male patients.</p>

<p>Three of the male patients, including one who was 16 at the time, testified they never saw Diaz before receiving the prescription medicines. All three either worked for or were related to Randy Thomley, owner of Thomley's Christmas Tree Farm, who helped them get the prescriptions started, according to testimony.</p>

<p>Albert "James" Hardwick said Thomley told him he would get paid for participating in a medical study if he started using the creams and pills. He signed up himself, his wife, LeAnn, and daughter Mica. He said he was paid more than $37,000 for the alleged study, which involved no doctor until Diaz appeared at his house on a Saturday to conduct an "examination."</p>

<p>Hardwick said Diaz did not examine him. He filled out and signed paperwork while Diaz asked a couple questions. Thomley and a male nurse came with Diaz, according to testimony.</p>

<p>LeAnn Hardwick testified she did not know about the compounded medicines until she found a package of them on her doorstep one day. She tried to call Advantage to stop the prescriptions but was told they were on auto refill so they could not be stopped.</p>

<p>Jonah McCleary, 19, who now lives with his mother in Olympia, Washington, testified he and his father, Damon, worked as farm hands for the Thomleys.</p>

<p>His father also recruited drug reps to help sell the compounding creams, according to testimony. McCleary said his father was paid a 6 percent commission for whatever the drug reps sold.</p>

<p>He said both he and his parents received the compounded creams and pills, accumulating "two to three milk crates-worth" over about two years.</p>

<p>McCleary and LeAnn Hardwick testified the first compounded pain medications came from Dr. Brantley Nichols, an oral surgeon.</p>

<p>The third man to testify was Samuel Clinton, Thomley's stepfather, who began receiving the compounded creams after his wife asked him to try the new pain ointment her son was promoting.</p>

<p>Clinton said he was prescribed two other creams and vitamin pills. He began complaining, however, of getting too many bottles of the cream.</p>

<p>"They would send me three bottles at a time at least two times a month," he said. "I couldn't nearly keep up with the usage."</p>

<p>Thomley and Nichols are not among the four people who have been indicted in the case.</p>

<p>Diaz's attorney John Collette in his opening statement said Diaz did not write the prescriptions, nor did he profit from them.</p>

<p>"You're going to see money all over the place," Collette told the jury. "But what you won't see is one dime going to (Diaz).</p>

<p>"I don't believe there will be any proof Dr. Diaz did any of it."</p>

<p>Schaar, 47, of Biloxi pleaded guilty in July to conspiracy to commit health care fraud. He said Diaz received no kickbacks for writing the prescriptions.</p>

<p>Schaar said Diaz was uncomfortable with signing the pre-printed prescriptions when he learned they were billed to TRICARE.</p>

<p>"You don't mess with the government," Schaar said Diaz told him.</p>

<p>The only witness to testify Monday was Schaar's co-defendant Jason May, who also pleaded guilty in July to conspiracy to commit health care fraud and money laundering of around $190 million.</p>

<p>May was the pharmacist in charge at Advantage Pharmacy in Hattiesburg from December 2011 to January 2016, when federal agents searched the facility and took documents, computers and other materials, forcing the pharmacy to close.</p>

<p>May identified around 100 vials of compounded creams and pills as those prescribed by Diaz to several patients, including multiple family members.</p>

<p>He testified the creams, used for treating chronic pain, were created to derive the maximum reimbursement value and were not tested for medicinal value.</p>

<p>"They were made largely based on retail value and profitability," May said.</p>

<p>Some of the creams included ketamine, a controlled substance. Others included ingredients that could be purchased separately over the counter.</p>

<p>One prescription's reimbursement value was around $13,580. Others ranged from $690 to $5,800.</p>

<p>May said the pharmacy sometimes decreased the copay to keep patients from canceling their prescriptions.</p>

<p>If convicted, Diaz faces up to 305 years in prison and fines of up to $7.5 million.</p>

<p>Also indicted is a nurse practitioner, Susan Perry of Grand Bay, Alabama, who operated Immediate Family Clinic in Biloxi. Her trial is set to begin in Hattiesburg during the court term beginning April 16.</p>

<p>Clyde Kennard, who tried to become the first black student at the University of Southern Mississippi several times in the 1950s, is the subject of a new short documentary.</p>

<p>"Measure of Progress: The Clyde Kennard Story" tells Kennard's struggle to obtain higher education and the injustice that ensued as he was denied and later imprisoned on false charges.</p>

<p>"When we started these discussions (on the documentary), we wanted something archival," said Cheryl Jenkins, associate director of Center for Black Studies at Southern Miss. "We wanted something where students, the community could have, could go and say this is the Clyde Kennard story.</p>

<p>"Our goal is when students come to this university, they should not leave USM without knowing that story."</p>

<p>Related: Freedom Trail marker honors Clyde Kennard, first black man to try to attend Southern Miss</p>

<p>The presenters hope to spark an open dialogue about race relations through the documentary and make Kennard's voice heard, not just at the university, but in the community.</p>

<p>"We believe that if we get this story out to enough people that the public will also rise up and say, 'Southern Miss, what are we doing?'" said Sherita Johnson, director of the Center for Black Studies at Southern Miss.</p>

<p>During his struggles, Kennard wrote letters to the editor published in the Hattiesburg American to share what he was going through. Some of the text of those letters were used in the documentary.</p>

<p>Clyde Kennard (Photo: American file photo)</p>

<p>"I think because he wrote those letters, that was his mandate," Johnson said. "That if you inform the public about what is going on, then the public is responsible for making those changes."</p>

<p>If more funding becomes available, producer Alysia Burton Steele would like to add more to the documentary, eventually making a full feature-length film.</p>

<p>"We moved to Mississippi five years ago and had never heard of Mr. Kennard," Steele said. "We are completely honored to work on this project.</p>

<p>"We never work alone in this world. This was a collaborative project, with a lot of time and effort and passion for the legacy, for the history of Mr. Kennard — I hope he's looking down on us, smiling down on our work."</p>

<p>The documentary was produced by Steele, Ji Hoon Heo and Bobby D. Steele Jr., in partnership with the Freedom50 Research Group — Johnson, Jenkins, Rebecca Tuuri and Loren Saxton Coleman — through a $7,500 humanities-based racial equity grant from the Mississippi Humanities Council and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.</p>

<p>It'll soon be harder to find news from the Hattiesburg American on Facebook. Here's a step-by-step guide to help ensure you'll keep getting the latest local news in your feed. Wochit</p>

<p>Sumrall High School officials were on alert Thursday morning after a social media threat referenced "SHS" as a possible site for violence.</p>

<p>"This morning we were made aware of a post on a social media application that referenced SHS as a potential site for an act of violence," the district said on Facebook. "This post may not be referencing Sumrall High School, however we feel it is important to treat any and all situations as serious that may involve one of our schools."</p>

<p>Lamar County School District officials have stepped up security to ensure student safety while an investigation is underway, even though the investigation points to the post originating in another state and not related to Sumrall High.</p>

<p>"Due to the uncertainty of the post, we are placing additional law enforcement staff on the campus of Sumrall High School and we are thoroughly investigating this potential threat," the post said. "As always the safety and security of our students and staff are a priority for the district."</p>

<p>Last week, Purvis High was the subject of a rumored threat.</p>

<p>Administrators at the school administered disciplinary measures following an altercation between two students, in which one threatened the other. That led to rumors regarding student discipline issues at other schools.</p>

<p>Multiple schools throughout the Pine Belt and Mississippi were the targets of possible threats after the Feb. 14 mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida. None has resulted in any actual danger, but they are being taken seriously by school officials.</p>

<p>Seminary High School received a threat Feb. 16. The incident remains under investigation.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Petal School District officials alerted parents to a possible threat allegedly made on Snapchat.</p>

<p>A Petal Middle School student was determined a suspect and believed to be acting alone. Criminal charges have been filed against the student.</p>

<p>Superintendent Matthew Dillon said the student will also face disciplinary action by the district. Dillon was constrained from revealing additional details because the case is a student matter.</p>

<p>Southern Miss was one of the darlings of the college baseball world Monday.</p>

<p>Fresh off its three-game sweep of Mississippi State, the Golden Eagles found themselves fast risers in many national polls. The team went from unranked to No. 15 in D1Baseball.com’s first poll of the season. Southern Miss also went from unranked to No. 18, according to Perfect Game. Per Baseball America, the Golden Eagles moved from 21st to No. 17.</p>

<p>According to Perfect Game’s report, “Southern Miss was extremely shrewd in moving their Preseason All-American closer (Nick Sandlin) to the Friday night starter, setting the tone early as part of their series sweep over Mississippi State. That caused a flip-flop between the two teams in the rankings, as the Bulldogs fell out with the Eagles moving in.”</p>

<h2 id="barkerbuildsleadershipteamfocusesoncitys2018goals">Barker builds leadership team, focuses on city's 2018 goals</h2>

<p>With his administration nearly complete, Hattiesburg Mayor Toby Barker is continuing to build on his goals for the city.</p>

<p>While choosing who will help him lead the city, Barker also looked at how he could do it more efficiently.</p>

<p>"Throughout the last eight months, we’ve really been able to assess where the city is and where it can go," Barker said. "Leadership structure has been a key component of that."</p>

<p>Among the changes, Barker merged urban planning and federal/state programs into one department — Urban Development under the leadership of Andrew Ellard — and brought back the chief administrative officer position. Longtime city employee Ann Jones was Barker's pick for the job, bringing experience and institutional knowledge to the table.</p>

<p>Hattiesburg Mayor Toby Barker (Photo: Special to the American)</p>

<p>"(It) is a critical need in the day-to-day operations of our city, and it was important to me to bring it back," Barker said. "It’s one thing to have an idea, but it’s another to have someone you can lean on for the day-to-day things that make that idea come to life."</p>

<p>While some positions have changed and others were added or deleted, salaries for the city's department heads in Barker's administration are similar to former Mayor Johnny DuPree's for the 2013-17 term.</p>

<p>DuPree's administrators' salaries totaled around $956,000 per year. Barker's are at $878,500, which does not include a vacant public works director position, which under DuPree was paid $65,000. Once filled, Barker's administrative salaries will total $943,500 if the public works director is hired at the same salary.</p>

<p>Most salaries are comparable or even less than Biloxi's, which is similar in population to Hattiesburg. According to the 2016 Census estimate, the most recent available, Hattiesburg's population was 46,926, while Biloxi's was 45,975.</p>

<p>For example, Biloxi's chief administrative officer earns $105,000. Hattiesburg's makes $72,000. Hattiesburg's city clerk earns $65,000, while Biloxi's makes $58,532.75.</p>

<p>The controller (chief financial officer), urban planning director and police chief in Biloxi each make around $85,000. In Hattiesburg, the CFO makes around $65,000 (full time), the urban planning director makes $80,000, and the police chief will begin earning $95,000 in April.</p>

<p>Barker still has two director-level positions to fill: fire chief and public works director. But he plans to take his time finding the right people, rather than filling a position with someone who may not be a good fit.</p>

<p>"Finding candidates for these two positions isn’t just about finding someone who can do the jobs," he said. "It’s about buying into the vision we have for our city, being the right fit for the job and leading from the front.</p>

<p>"One decision I made early on was to let the leadership landscape develop on its own, and that has worked out well. We have some incredible personnel already inside city government. We brought some outside talent in to bring fresh perspective. If given the choice between a quick decision and a good decision, I'll always opt for the latter."</p>

<p>Not only do members of Barker's administration bring experience, they also share the mayor's philosophy of collaboration and communication. That was a must for Barker in determining who would fill the leadership roles best.</p>

<p>"Overall, I think you’re beginning to see more collaboration across departments and a strong increase in information sharing," he said. "In government, it’s easy to work in silos and do things because they’ve always been done that way.</p>

<p>"I also think you can see that our leadership team is invested in progress for every neighborhood in Hattiesburg. It’s important to me that all wards see updates to infrastructure and quality of life in an equitable way."</p>

<p>But city leaders are not the only ones who are helping Barker lead Hattiesburg in a forward direction.</p>

<p>"Every single person has a place," he said. "We encourage all employees and residents to find a niche and tap into the enthusiasm we all feel for the future success of our city."</p>

<p>Barker said even though his team is on a track that will continue to help Hattiesburg develop and grow, he realizes the city still has its issues and wants to address them head on.</p>

<p>"Turning a ship takes time, and we are very aware of our financial and organizational challenges," he said. "However, we continue to encourage our team (from the top down) to dig in and invest in the opportunity and potential of our city."</p>

<p>City Council President Carter Carroll said he is pleased with how Barker has been running the city in his first eight months in office.</p>

<p>"As far as his department head choices, they have all been excellent — he's chosen excellent people to help run the city.</p>

<p>"It's quite obvious when I'm out talking to people in the city. They seem to be very pleased."</p>

<p>Carroll said Barker has an administration where lines of communication are open in all directions.</p>

<p>Barker, for example, encourages council members to interact with staff, where DuPree preferred council go to him for information, Carroll said.</p>

<p>"Toby encourages it," Carroll said. "He calls us and lets us know things well in advance so if we have questions or problems we can discuss it and see if there is any way we can can compromise."</p>

<p>Carroll said Barker also speaks to each council member individually so they can talk about individual wards' needs.</p>

<p>"It's working well," Carroll said. "We've all known each agenda item for a while, and we've already spoken to him about them."</p>

<p>Ward 2 Councilwoman Deborah Delgado said time will tell the impact the new administration will have on the city.</p>

<p>Nick Sandlin was, in a word, masterful.</p>

<p>Making the first start of his collegiate career, the junior right-hander tossed 7 shutout innings to lead Southern Miss to an 11-0 win over Mississippi State in the season opener Friday at Pete Taylor Park.</p>

<p>Sandlin, whose last start came during Greenbrier High’s (Georgia) state championship run in 2015, struck out a career-high 9 Bulldogs. He allowed 3 hits in the third inning. The only other Mississippi State knock off Sandlin (who threw 93 pitches) came in the sixth.</p>

<p>In that third inning, Sandlin gave up three consecutive singles with two outs before inducing an inning-ending fielder’s choice off Hunter Stovall’s bat. Sandlin, who has 20 career saves at Southern Miss, said escaping the third-inning jam felt like the old days.</p>

<p>“It helped me,” he said. “I’ve been in a lot of situations like that before. I think that was the turning point of the whole outing for me.”</p>

<p>Sandlin scoffed at the notion that he might have been nervous making his first start since Game 1 of the state championship series in 2015.</p>

<p>More: AP: Southern Miss star Matt Wallner 'could be the best two-way player in the nation'</p>

<p>“I think (nerves) kind of got left behind about my freshman year having to be the closer,” he said. “I didn’t feel too many jitters.”</p>

<p>Konnor Pilkington, the Bulldogs’ starter, held Southern Miss hitless through 2 2/3 innings. In the fourth, the Golden Eagles got to the left-hander when Hunter Slater’s full-count, 2-out double scored Luke Reynolds. In the bottom of the fifth, Matt Guidry’s solo home run knocked Pilkington out of the game.</p>

<p>Story continues below video. </p>

<p>“I thought Konnor did a really nice job tonight,” Mississippi State coach Andy Cannizaro said. “But (Southern Miss) drove his pitch count up and we weren’t able to keep him out there very long.”</p>

<p>Reynolds, who transferred to Southern Miss from Mississippi State before the 2017 season, and Guidry drove in two runs apiece.</p>

<p>The Golden Eagle offense, which scored at least one run from the fourth to the eighth innings, tacked on a 5-spot in the eighth to turn things into a rout.</p>

<p>Reynolds, who scored the game’s first run, put on a strong display of emotion rounding third base.</p>

<p>Story continues below video. </p>

<p>“I was running high those first couple of innings,” he said. “I was ready to get out there and get going. Then, when that happened, I let ‘em all out. Right at that moment, I was like, ‘You know what, I’m in the game, let’s go.’ That settled me in. I needed to do that.”</p>

<p>Southern Miss hitting coach Chad Caillet served as the team’s interim head coach Friday, as head coach Scott Berry served the first of his two-game suspension. Berry was ejected from the 2017 season finale (against Mississippi State) and officials ruled he did not leave the playing field in a timely fashion following the heave-ho, resulting in the two-game suspension. Despite serving the suspension, Berry was credited with the win, which is the 300th of his career.</p>

<p>“Nick Sandlin set the tone, no question,” Caillet said. “Pilkington is a tremendous arm, so our whole game plan was to grind out some at-bats and take advantage of the bullpen. But Matt Guidry had some big hits and Cole Donaldson as well.”</p>

<p>Donaldson finished with two hits and an RBI.</p>

<p>Cannizaro doted on Sandlin’s performance before recounting the message to his players following the game.</p>

<p>“Sandlin was incredible tonight,” he said. “He was the best guy in the ball park tonight. Their shortstop played incredible. He made some really difficult plays early in the game to keep runners off the bases for us.</p>

<p>“I told our guys to look at the scoreboard. I don’t want them to forget about this night. ‘I want you to see the scoreboard and I want you to be bothered by what happened tonight.’”</p>

<p>Southern Miss and Mississippi State will meet in game two of the series at 1 p.m. Saturday. Stevie Powers is slated to start for the Golden Eagles, while Ethan Small will take the ball for the Bulldogs.</p>

<p>JACKSON – Two officers at South Mississippi Correctional Institution in Greene County were arrested Tuesday after they were caught with contraband during the first major shakedown of the year under Operation Zero Tolerance.</p>

<p>Jadijah Rawls, 21, a correctional officer trainee hired in November, and Diane Phillips, 64, a correctional officer since February 2014, were booked into Greene County Jail.</p>

<p>Officers seized a cellphone concealed on Rawls and $750 cash, and $1,420 in Green Dot (debit card) numbers from Phillips.</p>

<p>“We are finding people who are trying to supplement their salaries by doing these types of illegal things,” Mississippi Department of Corrections Commissioner Pelicia E. Hall said during an appearance before the Senate Judiciary B Committee meeting Tuesday afternoon. She mentioned the shakedown while responding to questions. “But we have a zero tolerance because of it. The end result is I am continuing to lose staff, and that makes my understaffing problem that much greater.”</p>

<p>Diane Phillips (Photo: Courtesy of MDOC)</p>

<p>In addition to the money found on Phillips, $535 also was found hidden in a wall.</p>

<p>Other seized contraband items include 50 sharpened items, 27 smartphones, 41 cellphone chargers, four flip phones, six cellphone batteries, three MP3 players, 20 sets of earbuds and Bluetooth devices, 14 packages of marijuana, 55 packages of spice, seven packages of suspected crystal methamphetamine, one package of suspected cocaine, 11 packages of tobacco, numerous unidentified pills and assorted other items.</p>

<p>“One officer reportedly said during the shakedown at SMCI that she now feels safe for the first time in 16 years,” Hall said. “That is good to hear because these shakedowns are designed to do just that — to help staff and inmates be secure.”</p>

<p>Rawls and Phillips face termination. If convicted, they face up to 15 years in prison and/or a $25,000 fine.</p>

<p>Hattiesburg Mayor Toby Barker on Thursday swore in two new police officers, both lateral transfers from other law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>Officers Joshua Gandy and Dawn Garcia took the oath of office at City Hall.</p>

<p>The two new officers bring Hattiesburg Police Department's total to 95.</p>

<p>“A goal of mine and Chief (Anthony) Parker’s is to get our officer numbers up to 107 by the end of the year," Barker said. "This will allow us better capacity to be in our community more, be in neighborhoods to build relationships, and to prevent crime. It’s a goal we fully intend to make a reality; and with the addition of Officers Gandy and Garcia, we get the opportunity to take steps to achieve that goal.”</p>

<p>Gandy grew up in Hattiesburg and is certified by the Mississippi Law Enforcement Officer’s Training Academy in Pearl. He comes to the department from Lamar County Sheriff’s Department where he currently serves as a part-time deputy. He previously worked with Covington County Sheriff’s Department and Forrest County Sheriff’s Department.</p>

<p>Officer Dawn Garcia takes the oath of office Thursday at Hattiesburg City Hall.</p>

<p>Garcia is from Brooklyn and holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in criminal justice/criminology from Saint Leo University in Florida. She is certified by the Southern Regional Public Safety Institute at Camp Shelby. She is transferring from Forrest General Hospital Police Department. She also has experience with Laurel Police Department, Virginia Department of Corrections and Forrest County Jail.</p>

<p>Hattiesburg police will be paid according to a new pay scale beginning in April.</p>

<p>City Council voted unanimously to approve the measure at Tuesday's regular meeting.</p>

<p>"I've long been an advocate for incentive pay that rewards continued education," Ward 4 Councilwoman Mary Dryden said.</p>

<p>The scale will take into account the number of years an officer has been with the department and his or her education level up to a master's degree.</p>

<p>Base starting pay for officers is $35,000 per year, but an officer entering the force with a bachelor's degree will start at $37,000.</p>

<p>An officer with five years at the department with only a high school diploma will earn between $41,000 and $44,000 depending on his or her education level.</p>

<p>Patrolman Joshua Truss, who has been with the Hattiesburg Police Department for two years, said he is excited about the new pay scale.</p>

<p>"It gives you an incentive, a goal where you possibly could be," he said. "If I work hard enough and been with the police department long enough, this is what they have to offer me."</p>

<p>A high school graduate, Truss attended college but never finished. With the new pay scale, he now has a reason to go back and get his degree.</p>

<p>"With a degree, you get paid even more," he said. "You can't beat an incentive. It's great."</p>

<p>Lt. Latosha Myers-Mitchell, who has been with the department more than a decade, said the new pay scale will not only benefit her, because she holds two master's degrees, but would also help strengthen the department.</p>

<p>Myers-Mitchell will make $66,500, the maximum allowed for her rank and tenure according to the newly adopted pay scale. Chief Anthony Parker will be the highest-paid officer at $95,000.</p>

<p>"That gives me something to look forward to as a veteran officer," Myers-Mitchell said. "And the fact that (the city) appreciates me gaining knowledge, even though there is not another step up after a master's degree, that will give me that extra push to go on and further my education."</p>

<p>The department will now have better tools to retain officers already on the force, she said.</p>

<p>"We have a goal to look forward to if we stay here and do what we are supposed to do, we will get this amount," Myers-Mitchell. "And it will inspire officers to try and go to the next rank and encourage officers to improve their education."</p>

<p>Truss agrees the new pay scale will help the department's retention efforts.</p>

<p>"I believe we already have a lot of pretty good officers, but this is just a reward for being there," Truss said.</p>

<p>City officials hope the new pay scale will help recruitment efforts, with which the department has struggled over the years.</p>

<p>"We have something for officers coming in that if they're coming from another agency, they'll actually be able to see what they have to look forward to," Myers-Mitchell said.</p>

<p>"We have something to offer officers coming in."</p>

<p>And the department will be able to hire officers with more experience and higher education levels.</p>

<p>"We want to get our numbers up with the right kind of officers," Mayor Toby Barker said in an earlier story.</p>

<p>The measure will not increase a new officer's base pay, which was raised to $35,000 in 2014, when officers received a $5,000 increase across the board.</p>

<p>Barker will sign a resolution honoring the approval of the new police department pay scale. The signing will be at 3 p.m. Friday at Hattiesburg Police Department, 300 Klondyke St.</p>

<p>Body cameras are usuallt seen as a solution to the problem of police brutality. However, a new survey of 75 police departments across the United States, found that the policies governing them have failed to foster transparency, protect privacy, or defend civil rights. A yearly report released by Upturn and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, found numerous key weaknesses this week in body cam policies across the country. 51 percent of the surveyed police departments made no changes to their body cam policies since last year.

<p>Part of a federal lawsuit in which two Hattiesburg police officers are accused of police brutality was revived last week by U.S. District Judge Keith Starrett.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs George L. Wade Jr. and the estate of the late George Wade Sr. were seeking $7.5 million in the case against then-HPD officers Demetrius Breland and Narottam Holden, claiming they used unreasonable force when responding to a domestic call on April 16, 2013.</p>

<p>A jury trial has been set for April 2 at William M. Colmer Federal Courthouse.</p>

<p>The defendants deny any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>In December, Starrett dismissed the Wades' case without prejudice.</p>

<p>"The only evidence of the force used against Wade Jr. before the court is Breland’s deposition testimony and incident report," Starrett said in his order dismissing the case. "Therefore this is the version of events that the court must use in order to determine if Breland used an excessive amount of force."</p>

<p>The Wades' attorney, Ottowa Carter, filed a motion for reconsideration, saying Wade Jr.'s deposition is in the Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, so Breland's testimony is not the only testimony on record.</p>

<p>Starrett agreed, but ruled only Wade Jr.'s excessive force claim will be reinstated.</p>

<p>"The narrative given by Wade Jr. does present a factual dispute as to whether Breland's use of force was reasonable," Starrett wrote in his order reinstating the case.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Wade Jr. and his wife, Susan, were having an argument. Their son joined in the fight.</p>

<p>The Wades say when Breland arrived at the family home, he was talking to Susan Wade when he "suddenly and without warning" kicked Wade Jr.'s leg, threw him on the ground, rubbed his face against the asphalt and handcuffed him.</p>

<p>Wade Jr. said Breland's actions caused his leg and foot to be broken. Wade Jr. also claims Breland kicked him in the groin area as he was placed in a patrol car.</p>

<p>Wade Sr., a retired police officer, allegedly saw Breland beating his son. He showed his badge to Breland, telling him he "was not treating his son right."</p>

<p>Breland is accused of pepper-spraying Wade Sr. then beating the 73-year-old when he went in the house to wash the pepper spray off his face. The officer allegedly pulled his gun on Susan and her daughter as they tried to help Wade Sr.</p>

<p>Susan again called Hattiesburg police, allegedly telling the dispatcher she feared Breland would kill Wade Sr.</p>

<p>Officer Holden and an unnamed female officer arrived at the Wade home, where Holden allegedly joined Breland in beating Wade Sr., according to the Wades' suit.</p>

<p>The female Wades said in the suit "they could hear (Wade Sr.) making sounds that were indicative of a person being subjected to a beating."</p>

<p>"As a result of this brutal and unlawful treatment, George Sr. suffered a concussion, fractured vertebrae, 10 stitches to his left eye, a burst blood vessel in his eye, a bruised shoulder, back, ribs and arms, and contusions (knots) on his head," the lawsuit claims.</p>

<p>Because only 113 of more than 300 law enforcement agencies even report crime to the FBI, and only five are using a system that records important details like specifics on drugs, gangs, and a victim's relationship to the suspect, we're missing out on important information.

<p>Body cameras are usuallt seen as a solution to the problem of police brutality. However, a new survey of 75 police departments across the United States, found that the policies governing them have failed to foster transparency, protect privacy, or defend civil rights. A yearly report released by Upturn and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, found numerous key weaknesses this week in body cam policies across the country. 51 percent of the surveyed police departments made no changes to their body cam policies since last year.

<p>Part of a federal lawsuit in which two Hattiesburg police officers are accused of police brutality was revived last week by U.S. District Judge Keith Starrett.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs George L. Wade Jr. and the estate of the late George Wade Sr. were seeking $7.5 million in the case against then-HPD officers Demetrius Breland and Narottam Holden, claiming they used unreasonable force when responding to a domestic call on April 16, 2013.</p>

<p>A jury trial has been set for April 2 at William M. Colmer Federal Courthouse.</p>

<p>The defendants deny any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>In December, Starrett dismissed the Wades' case without prejudice.</p>

<p>"The only evidence of the force used against Wade Jr. before the court is Breland’s deposition testimony and incident report," Starrett said in his order dismissing the case. "Therefore this is the version of events that the court must use in order to determine if Breland used an excessive amount of force."</p>

<p>The Wades' attorney, Ottowa Carter, filed a motion for reconsideration, saying Wade Jr.'s deposition is in the Memorandum in Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment, so Breland's testimony is not the only testimony on record.</p>

<p>Starrett agreed, but ruled only Wade Jr.'s excessive force claim will be reinstated.</p>

<p>"The narrative given by Wade Jr. does present a factual dispute as to whether Breland's use of force was reasonable," Starrett wrote in his order reinstating the case.</p>

<p>According to court documents, Wade Jr. and his wife, Susan, were having an argument. Their son joined in the fight.</p>

<p>The Wades say when Breland arrived at the family home, he was talking to Susan Wade when he "suddenly and without warning" kicked Wade Jr.'s leg, threw him on the ground, rubbed his face against the asphalt and handcuffed him.</p>

<p>Wade Jr. said Breland's actions caused his leg and foot to be broken. Wade Jr. also claims Breland kicked him in the groin area as he was placed in a patrol car.</p>

<p>Wade Sr., a retired police officer, allegedly saw Breland beating his son. He showed his badge to Breland, telling him he "was not treating his son right."</p>

<p>Breland is accused of pepper-spraying Wade Sr. then beating the 73-year-old when he went in the house to wash the pepper spray off his face. The officer allegedly pulled his gun on Susan and her daughter as they tried to help Wade Sr.</p>

<p>Susan again called Hattiesburg police, allegedly telling the dispatcher she feared Breland would kill Wade Sr.</p>

<p>Officer Holden and an unnamed female officer arrived at the Wade home, where Holden allegedly joined Breland in beating Wade Sr., according to the Wades' suit.</p>

<p>The female Wades said in the suit "they could hear (Wade Sr.) making sounds that were indicative of a person being subjected to a beating."</p>

<p>"As a result of this brutal and unlawful treatment, George Sr. suffered a concussion, fractured vertebrae, 10 stitches to his left eye, a burst blood vessel in his eye, a bruised shoulder, back, ribs and arms, and contusions (knots) on his head," the lawsuit claims.</p>

<p>The Hattiesburg American news team is constantly working to bring the best news experience to the Pine Belt.</p>

<p>Collins police are investigating a shooting at Sanderson Farms in Collins that left one person injured Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Collins Police Chief Joey Ponder said the department received a call at 4:11 p.m. of an active shooter at the chicken processing plant.</p>

<p>When officers arrived at the scene, they determined the male victim had been shot in the back and the suspect fled the scene.</p>

<p>Police are looking for Darrin Jones, 41, of Collins, who fled in a black 2007 Kia SLX. He is believed to be an employee at Sanderson Farms.</p>

<p>Ponder said police determined the shooting incident was the result of a personal grudge between the victim and suspect.</p>

<p>The victim was taken to an area hospital for treatment. His condition is unknown.</p>

<p>Ponder said the victim's name is not being released at this time for safety reasons.</p>

<p>College baseball is affected by a Mississippi law that lets government clerks or private business people cite their own religious beliefs to deny services to same-sex couples.</p>

<p>The Sun Herald reports the University of Southern Mississippi was supposed to play three games in Hattiesburg in late February against Stony Brook University. The games were canceled because New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo banned all non-essential state travel to Mississippi after Republican Gov. Phil Bryant signed the law in 2016.</p>

<p>Instead of playing in Hattiesburg Feb. 23-25, Southern Miss will play in a tournament at Stephen F. Austin University in Nacogdoches, Texas.</p>

<p>The law that could limit same-sex marriage took effect in October 2017 amid a series of legal challenges. It remains on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Why is Southern Miss management professor Russ Willis collecting flags from the countries of his international students? Ellen Ciurczak/Hattiesburg American</p>

<p>Buy Photo</p>

<p>Russ Willis has always been interested in foreign countries and international travel.</p>

<p>As a kid, the University of Southern Mississippi assistant teaching professor would look up foreign countries in the encyclopedia to find out about the languages spoken there and what the customs were like.</p>

<p>Now, as a teacher in the Department of Management and International Business, he meets foreign students and always has questions for them.</p>

<p>"How do they like it here? How did they get here?" Willis said. "Have they gotten acclimated? Have they met friends?</p>

<p>"I want to be sure I'm reaching out to them so they're having a good experience."</p>

<p>In his six years of teaching, Willis estimates he has had 50-60 international students in his classes.</p>

<p>"One of the great, rewarding experiences for me is I get to teach students from all over the world," he said. "It speaks highly of our programs at USM that we are attracting international students."</p>

<p>Willis recently began collecting flags from the home countries of his international students and putting them on display in his office. So far, he's ordered 17 flags from countries ranging from the Bahamas to Kenya to Uzbekistan to Vietnam.</p>

<p>"I want them to see their own flag here, and that will show them I care about them," Willis said. "I also want our American students to see that there are people and places bigger than what they know."</p>

<p>Willis said the flag collection has already had an impact.</p>

<p>"An international student from Uzbekistan came to my office and the very first thing he noticed was the Uzbeki flag," Willis said. "He took a picture of it and sent it back to his mom and dad in Uzbekistan."</p>

<p>Daniel Norton, associate vice president for international programs at Southern Miss, said he was not surprised to hear Willis had begun collecting flags from the countries of his students.</p>

<p>"Russ is like a goodwill ambassador for our Center for International Education," Norton said in an email. "I'm sure his students will be moved by this display.</p>

<p>"Small gestures like displaying home country flags or learning a few words in students' native language go a long way in helping our international students feel welcome here at USM."</p>

<p>Faye Gilbert, dean of the College of Business, also thought Willis' collection was a good idea.</p>

<p>"For students who are far from home, seeing (Willis') respect for their traditions, displayed in his office, has to be an exciting reinforcement of their decision to choose Southern Miss for their studies," she said in an email. "It is a personal statement of quiet support that resonates well."</p>

<p>Willis now hopes to one day display the flags of all 60 of his international students in his office.</p>

<p>"To get here, they have shown a lot of perseverance and determination, not only to come to a foreign country, but to come to a smaller city in a foreign country," he said. "It would be really fun if they brought me their flags, now that I have this starting point.</p>

<p>"I want something in my office so when people come in they see we have this international presence. I also want my international students to see they are part of something bigger than themselves and to see where other international students are coming from."</p>

<p>Hattiesburg has a new director of Parks and Recreation.</p>

<p>Mayor Toby Barker named Ronnie Perkins as his nominee for the post Thursday afternoon. About two hours later, City Council approved the nomination with a 4-1 vote during a special-called meeting.</p>

<p>City Councilwoman Deborah Delgado cast the lone dissenting vote.</p>

<p>"It's not personal," Delgado said. "I just think we need different leadership in that position. I wanted to see significant parks and recreation leadership experience in a person who would step forward to take that position.</p>

<p>"(Perkins) is a nice person, but that's not what we are doing here. We're trying to make sure we are serving the community in a big way."</p>

<p>Perkins will succeed Clemon Terrell, who died Nov. 30 of an apparent heart attack.</p>

<p>"When you have an announcement like this, you have to acknowledge who brought you so far, and today our thoughts are with Dr. Clemon Terrell and his family and what he did for this city over the course of 16 years," Barker said.</p>

<p>"(Terrell) laid a solid foundation for which we are looking forward to seeing how Ronnie Perkins builds on that."</p>

<p>Perkins, who worked for the department from 2002-04, is a longtime community member who lives in Palmers Crossing.</p>

<p>"Having known him several years I can tell you he loves his community," Barker said.</p>

<p>Barker said Perkins also has leadership and management skills, which he brings from working 13 years at Resinall.</p>

<p>"I think what the citizens of Hattiesburg get out of this is private sector expertise with a public service heart," the mayor said.</p>

<p>Perkins majored in music at Alcorn State University, where he attended from 1983-85. In 1983, he graduated from Forrest County Agricultural High School, where he serves as vice president of the school board.</p>

<p>“Our city’s parks and recreation programming saw great growth under the late Dr. Terrell’s leadership, and I look forward to continuing that trajectory,” Perkins said in a news release.</p>

<p>Perkins is the eighth appointment to Barker’s administrative team, following Lamar Rutland as city engineer, Anthony Parker as police chief, Wes Curry as municipal court judge, Andrew Ellard as director of urban development, Randy Pope as city attorney, Kermas Eaton as city clerk, and Ann Jones as chief administrative officer.</p>

<h2 id="repmissymcgeeifeeltheresponsibilitytopayitforward">Rep. Missy McGee: 'I feel the responsibility to pay it forward'</h2>

<p>by: Ellen Ciurczak</p>

<p>Missy McGee never considered running for public office until the opportunity was staring her in the face.</p>

<p>The lifelong Hattiesburg resident had worked on Toby Barker's campaign for mayor of the city, and when Barker won in June, opening up his central Hattiesburg representative's seat, she finally considered her options.</p>

<p>"Not until after he was elected mayor and his seat was open did I think of running," McGee said. "It was nothing I had planned.</p>

<p>"Never did I think I would be the one running for office. That was the first time I ever considered (it). It was never something I had indicated I had an interest in doing."</p>

<p>McGee may have been late in deciding to run for Barker's Hattiesburg seat, but it didn't hurt her effort. Originally, part of a field of four, she ended up winning a runoff in October.</p>

<p>McGee, a Republican, will be heading to Jackson as a full-time member of the state Legislature in January. She may be new to public office, but she's not new to public service. As a student at Hattiesburg High, she served as treasurer on the student council. Later, at the University of Southern Mississippi, she was on the cabinet of the Student Government Association.</p>

<p>After graduation, she moved to Washington, D.C., to work for Trent Lott, first for nine months while he was a congressman and then for three years as he held Mississippi's U.S. Senate seat.</p>

<p>"I did have an interest in public service and trying to make your community better," McGee said. "I think everyone has a role to play (in this world).</p>

<p>"If everyone does what they are passionate about, the entire community rises."</p>

<p>McGee also remembers her parents working on behalf of different political candidates and serving on their campaigns.</p>

<p>"I was aware of that, and it influenced me," she said. "It was something I've always known."</p>

<p>McGee felt she had the qualifications to run for the District 102 seat, having been born and raised in Hattiesburg and having lived in the city her entire life.</p>

<p>"I felt like the person needed deep roots in the community, and I honestly felt led to give back to the community that had given so much to me," she said. "I knew the people of Hattiesburg and their values, so I took that leap of faith and stepped out on the path that a month before I had not seen myself doing."</p>

<p>McGee was sworn in Oct. 13. As a state representative, she'll continue life as a stay-at-home mom to her two sons, but leave behind a career as a campaign worker, Southern Miss speech communication instructor and administrator at Warren Paving.</p>

<p>Since October, McGee has been traveling to Jackson about once a week, meeting with Speaker of the House Philip Gunn and his staff. She's also been networking with local delegates and meeting with officials from the legislative budget office.</p>

<p>"Every time I go to Jackson, it's such a positive experience," McGee said. "One meeting leads to another.</p>

<p>"Everybody has been so incredibly helpful to me. I feel so much more comfortable now."</p>

<p>It's a good thing McGee is feeling more comfortable. She gets no orientation period because she is not entering with a freshman class of legislators.</p>

<p>"The session starts Jan. 2, and it will be on-the-job training," she said. "You gotta get in there and get to work.</p>

<p>"Being a freshman means building relationships with my colleagues, building credibility at the Capitol and working with others to prove you're hardworking and trustworthy. I feel like I'm already on my way. I look forward to working with the (other lawmakers)."</p>

<p>Rep. Missy McGee, R-Hattiesburg, had an interest in public service from a young age.</p>

<p>(Photo: Special to the American)</p>

<p>Logan Grubbs, McGee's campaign manager, said relationship building is her strength.</p>

<p>"She works well with other people and is so genuine," he said. "She will build a coalition in Jackson that will greatly benefit the people of Hattiesburg.</p>

<p>"You see her likability and how many people respect and care for her. She has so much to offer."</p>

<p>Grubbs expects McGee will adjust rapidly to life at the Capitol.</p>

<p>"She will find her niche and adapt quickly," he said. "She will become a respected member of that community and leverage those relationships to get laws passed that are beneficial to the people of Hattiesburg."</p>

<p>McGee already knows where she stands on some issues expected to take center stage next year in Jackson. She is in favor of changing the state flag, which features the Confederate battle emblem.</p>

<p>"I believe our current flag is divisive," McGee said. "I believe a flag should unite all of its people.</p>

<p>"I would like us to unite under a flag every citizen in Mississippi could feel good about."</p>

<p>McGee is also in favor of a state lottery.</p>

<p>"I am open to any way to bring new monies to this state," she said. "I don't think a state lottery is the answer to all our financial woes — it is not the panacea for everything, but I am open to any creative way to bring more money to this state."</p>

<p>She's also supportive of finding ways to raise money to pay for infrastructure repairs in this state.</p>

<p>"Any creative ways that would be presented," she said. "Infrastructure needs are clearly very important."</p>

<p>Her No. 1 priority, however, is the people of Hattiesburg and their needs.</p>

<p>"I campaigned on a Hattiesburg-first platform," McGee said. "I want to be an advocate for the things that make us strong — our medical community, our university.</p>

<p>"I want to continue to work for the things that make us strong and address the areas where we have challenges."</p>

<p>Joe Paul, City of Hattiesburg customer service coordinator, has known McGee since both were at Southern Miss in the late 1980s. He was a student government adviser during the time she sat on the SGA cabinet.</p>

<p>"She always had a keen interest in public service and government," he said. "I knew that interest and talent was there.</p>

<p>"She's got the interpersonal skills to build relationships and trust quickly. The second piece is she's got the intellect to absorb and understand the legislative process. I think she'll have great success and be able to hold that position for many terms, and that's good news for Hattiesburg."</p>

<p>McGee realizes when she heads to the Capitol next week she has big shoes to fill. She is the first woman to hold the District 102 seat since Evelyn Gandy, who was elected in 1947.</p>

<p>"As a woman running for this seat 70 years later, it is a tremendous honor and I feel the responsibility to honor her legacy," McGee said. "She was a trailblazer, especially for women.</p>

<p>"Would I be here without her? Even all these years later, there are very few women who serve in the (state)house."</p>

<p>McGee hopes as she spends time in Jackson, advocating for the people of Hattiesburg, she can also be a role model, especially for other females. She'll be one of only 17 women in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p>"I feel the responsibility to pay it forward," she said. "What I would like to do is show young women you can do anything you can set your mind to.</p>

<p>"It is an honor to serve the same district Evelyn Gandy served. It is very meaningful to me."</p>

<p>(Photo: Special to American)</p>

<p>What are the major issues facing state lawmakers when they meet again beginning Jan. 2?</p>

<p>The answer depends on who's doing the talking, but it seems the matters that keep coming up are the budget, education funding, road and bridge repair, and Medicaid. All four could significantly impact state residents' lives.</p>

<p>"Perennially, we have the budget, which is the big issue," said Sen. Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall. "That probably is going to be a challenge because we don't want to raise taxes, but we have a limited amount of money.</p>

<p>"The (state) revenue over the past few months has been steady and even up a little bit. If that continues, maybe the budget won't be as much of a challenge. I'm cautiously optimistic."</p>

<p>In mid-November, Gov. Phil Bryant released a state spending plan that would keep most agency budgets flat for the next fiscal year, with a recommendation for general-fund spending of $1.5 million less than the current year. Legislative leaders followed with a proposal that called for cuts to most state agencies as a way to deal with a sluggish economy, the tax cuts enacted by lawmakers and the need to save revenue for emergencies.</p>

<p>Cuts could affect the economic health of the state, which could have an impact on everything from health care to transportation to education to fisheries and wildlife.</p>

<p>"The biggest, most important thing of all is the budget because of the shortage of revenue," said Sen. Billy Hudson, R-Hattiesburg. "From what I'm hearing, we're going to have to make more cuts, and that doesn't make people happy. It's not going to be a happy time, I'm afraid, this year."</p>

<p>Hudson said despite looming budget problems, something must be done to fix county bridges that are unsafe. </p>

<p>"Nobody likes to raise taxes. I'm a conservative, but I'm ready to do something to raise money (for county bridge repairs)," he said. "We've got to come up with a fuel tax or some other method."</p>

<p>Hudson said he thinks he's ready to vote for a 7-cents-per-gallon fuel tax, but he said lawmakers might go another way and approve a state lottery.</p>

<p>"I don't like it — it's taking money out of Mississippians' pockets to play a lottery," he said. "It's not a good way to raise money, but I think there are enough people in Jackson to get it passed.</p>

<p>"I look for the leadership to stay neutral on it and a lottery bill will pass. I'm gonna vote against it, but I think I'll get beat."</p>

<p>Rep. Larry Byrd, R-Petal, also thinks the lottery may come up as an issue.</p>

<p>"But I don't see any chance of that passing," he said. "The leadership isn't in favor of it, and the buck stops there.</p>

<p>"There's not enough positive effect on the economy of it. It doesn't make real good sense for us as a state right now."</p>

<p>Rep. Larry Byrd, R-Petal (Photo: Special to American)</p>

<p>Byrd sees K-12 education funding coming to the forefront.</p>

<p>"I think one of the biggest, most important issues right now is we're going to make a move on changing the education funding formula to a more student-centered formula," he said.</p>

<p>When Byrd says "student-centered," he's referring to a proposal by EdBuild, an education consulting firm hired by the Legislature last year to come up with a K-12 funding formula. EdBuild proposed the state put more money toward specific student populations like low-income and special needs students.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a matter of debate," Byrd said. "I think we're going to be working on it."</p>

<p>Rep. Brad Touchstone, R-Hattiesburg, agrees education funding will be on the agenda.</p>

<p>"We've been in the process of how to simplify (the funding formula) and make it more predictable for school districts," he said. "I hope it's not a fight. It's too important to get bogged down in a political fight.</p>

<p>Rep. Brad Touchstone, R-Hattiesburg (Photo: Special to American)</p>

<p>"I do expect a vigorous debate. I anticipate we'll adopt many of EdBuild's recommendations. Whether we'll adopt all of (their) recommendations remains to be seen."</p>

<p>Touchstone said the other top issue he sees is Medicaid. Legislators must pass the "Medicaid technical amendments bill," or Med tech bill, to reauthorize the division before it sunsets in 2018. Fillingane agrees this will be an important task for lawmakers.</p>

<p>"All of the issues related to the state Medicaid budget will be reviewed," he said. "Most people don't realize, up to one-fourth of our state's population is on some sort of Medicaid assistance. Then we have all of our local clinics, hospitals, dentists, pharmacies — almost everyone is affected by the Medicaid budget.</p>

<p>"That is why this bill is so important, and it gets so much attention from the medical community."</p>

<p>Rep. Chris Johnson, R-Hattiesburg, also predicts lawmakers will spend a lot of time on the Med tech bill, which comes around every two or three years.</p>

<p>Rep. Chris Johnson, R-Hattiesburg (Photo: File photo/Hattiesburg American)</p>

<p>"I have not gone through a Med tech bill yet, but from what I'm gathering, it will be a substantial bill," he said. "Many laws, when they go into effect have a repeal date — most end at the end of a fiscal year.</p>

<p>"(With something like the Med tech bill), if the Legislature does nothing, then the law expires, so it forces the Legislature to bring that law up again and take another look at it."</p>

<p>Sen. John Polk, R-Hattiesburg, also believes Medicaid and education funding will come up. He's also putting his bets on city and county infrastructure.</p>

<p>"I think they're going to be talking about a tax increase. I think they'll be talking about a lottery," he said</p>

<p>Sen. John Polk. R-Hattiesburg (Photo: File photo/Hattiesburg American)</p>

<p>Polk said he realizes state roads and bridges are also in disrepair, but he is reluctant to allocate money to the Mississippi Department of Transportation because the agency doesn't follow state purchasing and procurement regulations.</p>

<p>"Until they agree to come under our procurement laws, I am hesitant to give them any funding," he said. "Many of us are hesitant to run it through DOT."</p>

<p>But Polk said he would like to make sure cities and counties get the money they need to fix their roads and bridges.</p>

<p>"I don't know what that would look like," he said. "I know our counties have infrastructure problems that have to be addressed."</p>

<p>In addition to all the issues previously mentioned, Hudson did have one more prediction.</p>

<p>"Somebody will have a flag bill," he said. "(I think) if people want to vote to change the (state) flag, I'm OK with that, but I'm not going to vote in the Legislature (to change) what people did at the ballot."</p>

<p>Mississippians voted in 2001 to keep the state flag, which features the Confederate battle emblem.</p>

<p>"I think a flag bill will be introduced, but I don't think it will go anywhere," Hudson said.</p>

<p>Making a difference in their communities played a big part in both Nicholas Brown's and Jeffrey George's decision to run for public office.</p>

<p>Since they were elected in June to serve on Hattiesburg City Council — George in Ward 1 and Brown in Ward 5 — both have worked hard to fulfill that goal.</p>

<p>"I got interested in running around 2013," Brown said. "I wanted to see things get done. I wanted to engage with the people and see what their needs were and try to meet the needs.</p>

<p>"I wanted to see things happen, get the ball rolling."</p>

<p>More: La Mexicana owner Carlos Molina gets involved 'because it's the right thing to do'</p>

<p>Brown, 35, believes as a City Council member, he should be visible and in communication with his constituents. He also wants to see customer service improved throughout the city, including himself as an elected official.</p>

<p>"People, they pay taxes, they are our main priority," he said. "We should treat them as if they are our best interests, which in my opinion they are."</p>

<p>The Hattiesburg native said Ward 5 residents have told him they want ditches covered, more sidewalks and street lighting, and better roads.</p>

<p>Brown, who is new to politics, also wants to work more with the city's youth and see more mentoring and tutoring programs in the city.</p>

<p>He is an entrepreneur, beginning as a teenager mowing grass and doing yard work. Although Brown had other jobs, he continued the yard work, eventually forming his own company and turning it into a full-time job, so he feels he can use those business skills to help his constituents.</p>

<p>"I just try to pay attention to what I see needs to be done, and people are calling me, telling me things," he said.</p>

<p>Related: With 2 new members, Hattiesburg City Council looks to the future</p>

<p>Brown's roots in Ward 5 began with his grandmother, the late Elice Bridges, a woman who was active in her community and helped many people during her life. His parents, Frank and Josie Brown, also are active community members.</p>

<p>Brown hopes to continue that legacy.</p>

<p>"I definitely feel that I'm a product of the entire village," Brown said in his campaign notes when running for City Council. "My education and work foundation shaped me into a hard worker, critical thinker and problem-solver."</p>

<p>George, 23, has lived in Hattiesburg only 6½ years, but he has already made the Hub City his home. He was elected Southern Miss' Student Government Association president twice — running the first time as a sophomore. Only two other presidents were elected twice to the SGA.</p>

<p>George also was president of the Mississippi Student Body President’s Council, where he represented 80,000 students to the Legislature and Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees.</p>

<p>The Covington, Louisiana, native said one of the reasons he decided to run was to help Southern Miss and the city of Hattiesburg work together to the benefit of both.</p>

<p>"For me it was a big mixture of things," George said. "As I was involved at Southern Miss, I saw a lot of disconnects between the university and our city.</p>

<p>"I wanted to find ways to bridge that gap and create more partnerships as to where the university was contributing more to the community and the community was contributing more to the university."</p>

<p>Another reason he decided to run for city office was listening to residents' complaints when he interned in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>"They weren't these hot-button issues that you would think about, but things that affected people's daily lives," George said. "Running for City Council was a way for me to have the opportunity to improve people's daily lives."</p>

<p>More: Darryl Harris: Taking care of his community a priority</p>

<p>Some of the Ward 1 concerns George has heard about involve infrastructure — quality streets, water quality and sidewalks, especially because Southern Miss in located in his ward.</p>

<p>George said there are a lot of students and other transitional residents in the many apartment complexes in his ward.</p>

<p>In addition there are many older residents who are concerned about public safety.</p>

<p>"Because it's a residential area, they don't see a lot of police presence," George said.</p>

<p>Bringing new businesses to Hattiesburg and finding ways to create new jobs also are important to George.</p>

<p>Some of George's graduate research in workforce development looked specifically at what community colleges and high schools can do to prepare students for today's jobs, so he is familiar with what it takes for businesses and area workers to succeed.</p>

<p>George is active in the Hattiesburg community in other ways, including at the Arc of Southeast Mississippi as a volunteer on his own and through his fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi. The fraternity's philanthropy is The Ability Experience, which works with people who have disabilities.</p>

<p>His mother is a special-education teacher, so working with individuals with disabilities means a lot to George.</p>

<p>"People with disabilities is something I am passionate about," George said.</p>

<p>Hattiesburg Mayor Toby Barker, who at 35 is a young professional himself, said George and Brown work hard not only for their wards but to improve Hattiesburg as a whole.</p>

<p>"They want to see the entire city succeed," he said. "They have been very strong representatives of their wards but also bring ideas to the table for the entire city."</p>

<p>Having two young professionals lending their talents as City Council members is an advantage for the Hub City, Barker said.</p>

<p>"I think Jeffrey and Nick have brought such an energy and just new dynamic of inclusion and cooperation to city government," he said. "I think their presence points to how bright our city's future is."</p>

<p>A clear break is evident on the road to full rehabilitation for Mississippians who have paid their debts to society if they are unable to find jobs afterward.</p>

<p>But the reality is that the process of finding and acquiring employment can be significantly more difficult for a Mississippian who has served out a prison sentence and is seeking to integrate back into the norms of society.</p>

<p>Oftentimes, this leaves those residents without a job and puts them straight back into the life of crime that got them into trouble to begin with. This vicious cycle of recidivism is, unfortunately, all too real in Mississippi and across the country.</p>

<p>One Northeast Mississippi legislator plans to offer legislation during the 2018 session that he says might help end that cycle for some.</p>

<p>The bill Rep. William Tracy Arnold, R-Booneville, plans to introduce would give employers a $2,500 tax credit for one year if they hire non-violent felons who have completed their sentences. That non-violent detail is an important part of this proposal that should hopefully bring a sense of ease to those weary of considering an effort to promote the hiring of convicted criminals.</p>

<p>As a minister, Arnold says he’s seen firsthand the hardships that these residents go through in trying to find a job with the stigma of being a felon attached to their applications. He’s also seen that result in residents returning to a life of crime, which is what he ultimately hopes to prevent.</p>

<p>“This will give people a second chance to be productive citizens,” Arnold said.</p>

<p>Arnold believes the tax credit will actually save the state money because it costs the state about $30,000 per year to incarcerate a person convicted of a felony, as reported by the Daily Journal’s Bobby Harrison. A tax credit is the amount of money a person is able to subtract from taxes owed the government.</p>

<p>Arnold said he has filed similar legislation in the past, but it has died in committee.</p>

<p>A bill did pass the Legislature in the 2015 session providing a tax credit for employers who hire military veterans.</p>

<p>Obviously those two initiatives are very different, yet both are important in their own rights.</p>

<p>Arnold’s proposition deserves consideration for many reasons.</p>

<p>Helping eliminate recidivism throughout our state should always appeal to residents and leaders alike. No one — including the average taxpayer — wins when someone is stuck on a continuous loop through the criminal justice system. While there will always be some that are impossible to remove from that loop, making an effort to help those that truly are capable of integrating back into society seems like a valuable effort worth further exploration and discussion.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it gives us an opportunity to allow Mississippians who have made mistakes in their lives a second chance once they have served their time.</p>

<p>Three teens marked a turning point in their lives Thursday afternoon when they were honored at a graduation ceremony commemorating their completion of the Forrest County Juvenile Drug Court program.</p>

<p>The teens shared their stories of how they overcame their addiction to marijuana and Xanax, at first resisting then embracing the change.</p>

<p>The young men expressed regret for not only the time but also the money they wasted on drugs that could have been used for a better purpose.</p>

<p>They felt hopeful about their futures. And they shared their appreciation for the parents and siblings who stood by them even through the worst of times.</p>

<p>Court officials requested the names and ages of the graduates be withheld from the story to protect the privacy of the participants.</p>

<p>"I'm doing a lot better in school now that I'm not focusing on drugs," one graduate said.</p>

<p>He added that he had to accept responsibility for his actions and change his mindset to successfully complete the program.</p>

<p>Hattiesburg Mayor Toby Barker spoke at the graduation, encouraging the teens to write their own stories going forward.</p>

<p>He said even though their stories may have rocky areas, they have and can continue to weather those storms.</p>

<p>Barker said the graduates already have shown they have developed good habits and willpower by working hard to complete the program.</p>

<p>"Each of you have been brought here by your experiences," the mayor said. "The great thing about a story is you can't go back. You can't rewrite what has happened in the past.</p>

<p>"But those chapters are over. They are in the past. We have the power to determine how the rest of our story is going to look."</p>

<p>More: Chris Buckhalter to graduates: 'If you keep trying, you'll end up where you want to be'</p>

<p>Before graduation, Juvenile Drug Court Judge Michael McPhail congratulated the teens for getting through the program and showing they have the mettle to change their habits.</p>

<p>"I'm so proud of the fact that these individuals are going to be productive individuals and citizens in this community," he said.</p>

<p>The Forrest County Juvenile Drug Court program was started in 2007, Probation Officer Chris Thomas said. There have been many graduates of the program who have gone on to become drug-free and productive adults.</p>

<p>The program has four phases that participants have to pass before they can graduate. Some take longer than others to complete the program. Those involved in the program hope the teens see the value of their own lives and the impact it can have on others.</p>

<p>"Each one of us has a purpose in our lives," Thomas said. "We need to strive every day of our lives to make something of it and to contribute to our society."</p>

<p>Hattiesburg Mayor Toby Barker went almost six months without giving someone a key to the city.</p>

<p>On Thursday, that changed. Barker recognized Minnesota Twins second baseman Brian Dozier, a former Southern Miss star and current Hattiesburg resident, with both a proclamation as well as one of the top honors a city can bestow on a resident or esteemed visitor.</p>

<p>Dozier, a Golden Eagle stalwart from 2006-09 who helped get the team to its only College World Series, made Hattiesburg his permanent home shortly after his collegiate playing career ended. The 30-year-old recently completed his sixth season with the Twins. He hit 42 home runs in 2016, breaking the previous American League record for most home runs hit by a second baseman. For his defensive work last season, he was awarded his first career Gold Glove in November. In addition, Dozier is the first player in Major League Baseball history to hit a home run in both his first career All-Star Game and first career playoff game plate appearance.</p>

<p>“I was never the most recruited guy or talented guy, so to speak,” he said. “But when you surround yourself with people that are a lot better than you and know a lot more than you do, it only makes you better. Guys like Corky Palmer, Lane Burroughs and Scott Berry. And then teammates that were phenomenal, that you feed off of and learn from. I was very fortunate to have those people throughout my career (at Southern Miss).”</p>

<p>Barker said the decision to honor Dozier was an easy one.</p>

<p>“He has continually made our city and our university proud,” he said. “And for really three reasons. One: he was part of the greatest sporting accomplishment in our university’s history when our Golden Eagles made the College World Series. Secondly, just the way he carries himself. We’re forever reading headlines about bad things pro athletes do. But you know when Brian Dozier’s name comes up in a headline it’s always going to be for something good.</p>

<p>“Also, when I talk to students and young alumni, I encourage them to take on the character of our university. There’s a chip on our shoulder because we know we have something to prove. And you can look at folks like Brian, who has earned everything they ever got.”</p>

<p>Dozier, who is set to enter the final year of a four-year contract in 2018, said when he was made aware of Barker’s plans, he didn’t know what to make of it.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know if it opened anything or whatever,” he said. “But after I did a little research on it, it’s very humbling. But it’s very exciting and I’m very appreciative of it.”</p>

<h2 id="ismississippimakingalternaterouteteachinglicensehardertoget">Is Mississippi making alternate route teaching license harder to get?</h2>

<p>Want to know what your child did in school today? Here are some tips about how to ask. Wochit</p>

<p>Lindsay Ball had been working in the accounting field for seven years, but she was feeling unfulfilled.</p>

<p>"I do not like sitting 8 hours a day, being confined to a desk," she said. "I like helping people.</p>

<p>"I've always enjoyed volunteering in the community with children."</p>

<p>Ball quit her accounting job in Columbia and decided to become a teacher.</p>

<p>"I had never realized I would like to be a teacher," she said. "I never considered that an option."</p>

<p>Ball had a bachelor's degree in accounting from Mississippi State, but no degree in education. That's why she decided to pursue an alternate route teacher's license. It allows candidates without an education degree to gain a teacher's license in as little as a year.</p>

<p>The state Board of Education recently made some changes to the alternate route license, making it easier for teaching candidates to get jobs as they pursue the certificate. And more changes may be coming. The Mississippi Department of Education has been contacting teaching officials to ask their opinion of proposed modifications that would make completing the license harder to do.</p>

<p>With the teacher shortage in full swing in this state, any changes to the alternate route license could have profound effects.</p>

<p>The alternate route teaching license is especially important in today's climate, said Jay Howell, University of Southern Mississippi assistant professor and alternate route coordinator in the Department of Curriculum, Instruction and Special Education.</p>

<p>"Given Mississippi’s teacher shortage, we need more than one pathway to teacher licensure," he said. "Not everyone knows they want to become a teacher at age 18 as a freshman in college.</p>

<p>"Some realize they want to teach after years of doing corporate or military training or after having completed a degree in a content area they love such as history, biology or mathematics. Alternate route licensure allows these people to enter into teaching, thereby expanding the pool of qualified teacher candidates for Mississippi school districts."</p>

<p>Candidates for alternate route certification must have a bachelor's degree with a grade-point average of 2.75 in their content area and a cumulative ACT score of 21 or a passing score on a teaching test called the Praxis. They must also pass the Praxis II in their area of certification.</p>

<p>Then they must complete an approved training program with two required classes in education — one in tests and measurements, the other in classroom management. Once these requirements are met, they are eligible for a three-year, non-renewable license. Then, teachers must complete two internship classes to receive a five-year renewable license.</p>

<p>Ben Burnett, dean of the William Carey University School of Education, said education officials from the state contacted him this summer to ask what he thought of some proposed changes to the alternate route requirements. Currently, teachers with an alternate route license cannot teach kindergarten through third grade.</p>

<p>Burnett said Mississippi Department of Education officials were considering adding grades 4-6 to the list of excluded classes. They were also thinking about adding a third course to the two already required.</p>

<p>Burnett did not want to go on record with what he thought of the proposed changes. He did say he thought the alternate route license, as it stands now, is a good thing.</p>

<p>"I was skeptical as a principal, early on, to hire alternate route teachers," he said. "But the teacher shortage was not a problem then.</p>

<p>"But then I found, in my career as a principal, alternate route teachers had already experienced another career. What they lacked in student preparation, they brought in maturity and life experience.</p>

<p>"I think alternate route produces good teachers. I think we would be lost in Mississippi without alternate route licensing."</p>

<p>Officials at the Mississippi Department of Education did not want to talk in detail about their proposed changes.</p>

<p>"There is nothing to share at this time," spokeswoman Patrice Guilfoyle said in an email. "Strengthening our alternative pathways to educator licensure is part of a multi-level plan.</p>

<p>"We are currently working to strengthen in some cases and develop in other areas a few key foundational components that are required, prior to making changes to preparation programs."</p>

<p>One change in alternate route licensing, to help school districts facing critical teacher shortages, has already taken place. The state Board of Education in November approved issuing a temporary one-year license to teachers who hold at least a bachelor's degree in the subject area they want to teach. A candidate could also get the license by having 21 hours of coursework at the undergraduate or graduate level in the subject matter.</p>

<p>“This allows a district to request to hire a candidate who has not met the requirements to get into an alternate route program," Howell said. "After that year has elapsed, (the candidate has) to go through and make progress towards enrollment in an alternate route program.</p>

<p>"The district can request the special, nonrenewable license be issued again in the second and third year, but only if the candidate is making satisfactory progress towards enrollment.”</p>

<p>According to Projection Central, the teaching industry in Mississippi will experience nearly 10 percent growth through 2024. The state Department of Employment Security projects 455 average annual job openings for elementary teachers, 350 average job openings for middle school teachers and 390 average annual job openings for high school teachers in Mississippi through 2022. It is not clear how many teachers in the state are pursuing alternate route licensing.</p>

<p>"School districts across Mississippi need teachers, especially in critical areas like math and science," Howell said. "The changes allow districts to hire potentially good teachers while they're still in the process of becoming certified."</p>

<p>For Ball, who is already teaching sixth-grade math in the Columbia School District on a non-renewable license and completing the alternate route program at William Carey, the alternate certification was the only way to go.</p>

<p>"It's so great," she said. "If you already have a bachelor's degree, you only have to take four classes and it certifies you to become a teacher.</p>

<p>"This is a job I love to come to. I'm always satisfied at the end of the day. God has led me to what I'm supposed to be doing."</p>

<p>Hattiesburg City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to adopt a new public records ordinance and repeal the old one.</p>

<p>The new ordinance is designed to be more transparent and customer-centric, said Joe Paul, Hattiesburg's customer service coordinator.</p>

<p>"Transparency breeds trust," Paul said in an earlier story. "Our business is the public's business, and they have a right to know."</p>

<p>Paul was tasked by Mayor Toby Barker with coming up with suggestions for the revised ordinance and subsequent policies and processes.</p>

<p>Paul met with Jackson attorney Leonard Van Slyke, an expert on the state's public records and open meeting laws, and Tom Hood, executive director of the Mississippi Ethics Commission to learn more about the state's laws and get suggestions on crafting the city's ordinance.</p>

<p>"It was very educational for all of us in terms of what the best practices might be," he said.</p>

<p>The city last updated the ordinance in 1990 and had many revisions and much of the policy was out of date, so City Council voted to throw out the old ordinance and adopt the new one.</p>

<p>The new ordinance says that with a few exceptions noted in the policy, "all public records are hereby declared public property and any person shall have the right to inspect, copy, mechanically reproduce or obtain a reproduction of any public record of a public body" in accordance with reasonable written procedures outlined in the new ordinance.</p>

<p>The ordinance also allows for lower fees charged for researching and copying requested records to further make them accessible.</p>

<p>"We want to be proactive in how we communicate with people," Barker said, which includes being as transparent as possible with city matters.</p>
