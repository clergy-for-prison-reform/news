<p>There is a humanitarian crisis unfolding on our borders, in which thousands of immigrant children, including infants and toddlers, have been forcefully taken from their parents and sent away with strangers. But another crisis — where families are also separated — is hanging over American life: mass incarceration. Now, though, one of the most important pieces of criminal justice reform legislation is on the cusp of becoming law in New York. As it stands, the bill is one signature away — Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s — from being put on the books.</p>

<p>Every day, we hear about horrible cases, in which men and women — often black men and women — are being set free from prison after serving huge chunks of their lives for crimes they didn’t commit. Sometimes they have served 30 or 40 years behind bars. Frequently, prosecutorial misconduct was the cause of the wrongful conviction.</p>

<p>America’s prosecutors are so hellbent on closing cases and getting guilty verdicts that they will often get them by any means necessary.</p>

<p>It could be that exonerating evidence was deliberately withheld or confessions of guilt from an entirely different person were disregarded. Maybe credible, verifiable alibis were ignored. In some cases, DNA evidence was shelved and ignored.</p>

<p>All this because America’s prosecutors are so hellbent on closing cases and getting guilty verdicts that they will often get them by any means necessary.</p>

<p>Jabbar Collins comes to mind.</p>

<p>In 1994, he was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a local rabbi — except he was completely innocent. Determined to close the case, prosecutors hid crucial evidence that exonerated him, threatened witnesses, and gave other witnesses perks to completely fabricate their testimony. After serving 15 painful years in prison, Collins was finally set free. It cost him a generation of his life — and it cost New York City and the state $13 million, which he won in a lawsuit.</p>

<p>These types of exonerations are far from uncommon. After reviewing all of their exoneration cases, guess what the Innocence Project determined as the leading cause of wrongful convictions? Prosecutorial misconduct. A 2018 study by the National Registry of Exonerations made the exact same determination. Police and prosecutor misconduct — not faulty witnesses or false confessions — is the primary cause of wrongful convictions in our country.</p>

<p>In New York, though, political bodies are finally pushing for some accountability. As of last week, the State Assembly and Senate have now each passed a bill, the first of its kind in the nation, forming an independent commission with full subpoena power, to investigate prosecutorial misconduct. It’s wild that nothing like this already exists, but that gets to the heart of the matter. America’s prosecutors have been able to be consistently awful with little to no formal, binding oversight.</p>

<p>Nearly 18 months passed between the bill’s introduction and its passage in both chambers of the state legislature. And now it’s awaiting Cuomo’s signature. The issue is so dire that Human Rights Watch wrote an open letter to the governor in support of the bill. “New York currently has no effective system in place to hold prosecutors who violate their legal and ethical duties accountable,” the New York-based group said in its letter.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch went on to detail case after case of wrongful convictions in the state in which prosecutorial misconduct was the primary cause. In each case, innocent people spent long periods of their lives behind bars for crimes they didn’t commit. Not only did the wrongful convictions and sentences cost the state millions of dollars to incarcerate the wrong people, tens of millions more were spent on settlements to compensate these men.</p>

<p>And yet the prosecutors just keep on handling cases like it never happened. The prosecutor in the Jabbar Collins case was eventually forced to retire because of misconduct, but he never faced any other sanctions. Eventually, he wrote a book that’s now reportedly being made into a TV show. It’s outrageous.</p>

<p>It wasn’t easy to get to this point. Now, one question remains: Will Cuomo sign the bill or veto it?</p>

<p>It wasn’t easy to get to this point where New York could pass historic legislation to hold prosecutors to account. Now, one question remains: Will Cuomo sign the bill or veto it?</p>

<p>Pretty much the only people fighting against the bill are prosecutors themselves. The District Attorneys’ Association of the State of New York lobbied hard against it, simply dismissing the measures as unnecessary — which is nonsense because we have seen, as in the Collins case, that far too often these prosecutors are not held to any account at all.</p>

<p>So Cuomo has to decide: Will he side with the people who have been wrongfully convicted because of prosecutorial misconduct — many of whom I’d guess remain in prison, their appeals unheard — or with the prosecutors who get away scot-free for putting the wrong people behind bars?</p>

<h2 id="theamericanrightwinghadanothergreatweekonline">The American Right Wing Had Another Great Week Online</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Sam Biddle</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-22</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/22/the-american-right-wing-had-another-great-week-online/ </p>

<p>American conservatives online are living in a weird sort of quantum state: They complain constantly of being persecuted across the web, silenced by a Stasi-like Silicon Valley liberal elite, and censored en masse. And yet their whining has never been harder to ignore, as they succeed again and again at getting tech companies to roll over for them with a smile.</p>

<p>After reports of jailed immigrant children shocked and outraged the portion of the world that objects to putting kids in jail, artist Sam Lavigne, who has worked as an adjunct professor at New York University, posted a list of every Immigration and Customs Enforcement employee he could find on LinkedIn. Lavigne compiled his list through automated “scraping,” a technique that essentially lets a computer copy and paste the whole of a website in a targeted manner, saving a human a lot of tiresome clicking; just last summer, a federal judge ruled that LinkedIn must allow this kind of access. Lavigne’s list, published at a time when the American right was most doggedly dismissing concerns over putting babies in cages, only included whatever content ICE employees had volunteered on the inherently public website built for sharing resumes, and carried no suggestion of harassing or harming any of these people. “As ICE continues to ramp up its inhumane surveillance and detention efforts,” Lavigne explained in a post on Medium, “I believe it’s important to document what’s happening, and by whom, in any way we can.”</p>

<p>Tech CEOs are, for mostly cynical reasons, deeply scared of their conservative users, and will continue to yield and bend.</p>

<p>And yet soon after it began to spread across Twitter, Lavigne’s list was struck from the web as if he’d published a list of ICE social security numbers. GitHub yanked the list on the grounds that it constituted “doxing,” the practice of publishing nonpublic data about an individual online, either to reveal their identity or sensitive contact information. It’s hard to imagine online information less sensitive than someone’s resume, particularly when they’ve voluntarily published that resume on LinkedIn, a website quite literally designed to publicize your employment status as widely as possible. Medium followed suit, deleting Lavigne’s Medium post, and The Verge noted that Twitter accounts associated with Lavigne’s project were shuttered. The most dire threat of the public knowing the names of federal employees who help to maintain an organization that incarcerates children was neutralized.</p>

<p>That same day, right-wing editor and Fox News contributor Guy Benson scored another win for the red team, announcing that he’d somehow convinced Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey to fly to Washington, D.C., and entertain a discussion of conservative victimhood:</p>

<p>Thank you, @jack, for meeting with a group of conservatives in DC tonight. Much work must be done to build and rebuild trust — as we discussed at length — but step one is actually talking. Appreciate it, sir. ??? @Twitter</p>

<p>— Guy Benson (@guypbenson) June 20, 2018</p>

<p>It’s unclear what exactly this is referring to, or what “trust” needs to be rebuilt between conservatives and Twitter, a site that more or less lets anyone on the political fringe run around with their eyes closed and ears plugged, screaming at the top of their lungs with impunity. For right-wing America and its spiritual leader in the White House, Twitter has been nothing if not an extremely reliable tool. But the toxic myth of anti-conservative bias in tech companies refuses to die, in part because the self-described victims are (to their great credit) tireless and loud, and in part because people like Dorsey keep indulging them. Despite the fact that white supremacists just this week secured a permit for a sequel to last year’s bloody Charlottesville hate rally, the absurd claim that the right wing is even slightly hampered in spreading even its most extreme messages persists. Thank you, @jack, indeed.</p>

<p>Twitter continued its accommodation spree after Splinter News published a cellphone number belonging to White House adviser Stephen Miller, reportedly the mastermind behind the aforementioned babies-in-cages policy. Not only did Twitter clamp down with a quickness rarely seen by those reporting neo-Nazis in their mentions, by temporarily banning Splinter’s account, the site also temporarily locked the accounts of people who had merely tweeted a link to the story:</p>

<p>Twitter is suspending accounts that tweeted out the LINK to the Splinter story with Stephen Miller's number. Whatever you think of tweeting out the actual number, going as far as to censor a link from a legitimate news site is unprecedented. https://t.co/38YFCVGLuC</p>

<p>Twitter, a company that at this point seems almost allergic to taking a stand against anything, is apparently pretty responsive under the right conditions.</p>

<p>Finally, the world was reminded that Facebook, just a few days after barring the news website Reveal from advertising a report on migrant children being forcibly drugged, still wanted to be a supportive home for news and reliable information online:</p>

<p>(Facebook is also partnering with CNN, ABC, Univision, and other outlets.)</p>

<p>There’s no reason to think tech’s toadying to and placation of the right will change. Tech CEOs are, for mostly cynical reasons involving growth, engagement, and quarterly earnings calls, deeply scared of their conservative users, and will continue to yield and bend in order to prevent some imagined conservative revolt — never mind how long the conservative oppressed have been threatening to leave Twitter and Facebook. Years of bluffing and braying about being censored now pays off regularly for the web’s right wing, which continues to parlay Silicon Valley boardroom anxiety into win after win, and continued to trumpet its pseudo-victimhood this week to great effect. For a silenced group, it sure is a loud trumpet.</p>

<h2 id="supremecourtrulesthattheusgovernmentmustgetawarrantbeforeaccessingcellphonelocationdata">Supreme Court Rules That the U.S. Government Must Get a Warrant Before Accessing Cellphone Location Data</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alex Emmons</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-22</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/22/supreme-court-rules-that-government-must-get-a-warrant-before-accessing-cell-phone-location-data/ </p>

<p>In a landmark privacy decision, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Friday that police must get a warrant in order to obtain your cellphone’s location data over an extended period of time.</p>

<p>The decision is a major victory for privacy advocates, who have long argued that the law has failed to keep pace with the amount of intrusive data we voluntarily hand over to private companies.</p>

<p>Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberal justices on the court, declaring that even though the data is held by a third party, the government still needs a warrant to obtain it.</p>

<p>“We decline to grant the state unrestricted access to a wireless carrier’s database of physical location information,” said Roberts, writing for the majority. “In light of the deeply revealing nature of [cell-site location information], its depth, breadth, and comprehensive reach, and the inescapable and automatic nature of its collection, the fact that such information is gathered by a third party does not make it any less deserving of Fourth Amendment protection.”</p>

<p>The court made the ruling in the case of Timothy Carpenter, who was convicted in 2013 of robbing Radio Shack and T-Mobile stores in Michigan and Ohio. In order to build their case, the FBI obtained 127 days’ worth of location information for Carpenter’s cellphone – almost 12,900 location points – which they used to place him at the scene of the robberies.</p>

<p>The FBI obtained the data under the Stored Communications Act, which allowed them to acquire it directly from Carpenter’s wireless provider without obtaining a warrant based on probable cause. According to disclosures by phone companies, police across the country make these types of requests tens of thousands of times per year.</p>

<p>When the case was argued in November, the government’s position was largely based on an old idea in Fourth Amendment law called the “third-party doctrine.” The Supreme Court expressed that idea in a famous ruling in 1979 that allowed police to obtain without a warrant a list of phone numbers dialed by an individual. The theory underlying that decision was that callers surrender their expectation of privacy when they hand that information over to a phone company.</p>

<p>But Friday’s ruling suggests that that opinion doesn’t apply to cellphone location information, which the court considers more intrusive.</p>

<p>“The Government’s position fails to contend with the seismic shifts in digital technology that made possible the tracking of not only Carpenter’s location but also everyone else’s, not for a short period but for years and years,” wrote Chief Justice Roberts.</p>

<p>Friday’s decision was made on narrow grounds, and the court did not examine potential implications for other technologies, like surveillance cameras, facial-recognition technology, or other types of phone or internet data. The court also declined to rule on whether obtaining real-time location data from a cellphone qualified as a search under the Fourth Amendment, and left open the possibility that the government could access less than seven days’ worth of location information without a warrant.</p>

<p>Jake Laperruque, senior counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, said that the decision was a massive step forward, but expressed disappointment that the court did not address the possibility of real-time tracking.</p>

<p>“[By] refusing to make this obvious extension of its ruling, the Court [has] prolonged this fight for years, and it left us unprotected from extremely invasive tools like stingrays that should clearly require a warrant,” Laperruque told The Intercept in an email.</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union hailed the decision, saying it would open the door to updating privacy law for a range of technologies. “This is a groundbreaking victory for Americans’ privacy rights in the digital age,” ACLU attorney Nathan Wessler, who argued the case in November, said in a statement. “The Supreme Court has given privacy law an update that it has badly needed for many years, finally bringing it in line with the realities of modern life. The government can no longer claim that the mere act of using technology eliminates the Fourth Amendment’s protections.”</p>

<h2 id="twoboyssuetheusgovernmentforseparatingthemfromtheirfathers">Two Boys Sue the U.S. Government for Separating Them From Their Fathers</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ryan Devereaux</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-21</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/22/family-separation-lawsuit/ </p>

<p>Inside the Heartland International Children’s Rescue Center in Chicago, Illinois, two young boys sit and wait. One is 15 years old. The other is 9. Their fathers are more than a thousand miles away, at two for-profit detention centers on the border. The two families came from Brazil, seeking asylum in the U.S. Instead, they were locked up. It’s been nearly a month since the four were separated. Only one of the boys has been able to speak to his father and even then, the conversation was brief.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, as President Donald Trump prepared to sign an executive order with potentially sweeping implications for immigrant detention, the boys became the latest plaintiffs to challenge the administration’s family separation practices. Their complaints, filed in Chicago, appeal to the same critical federal consent decree, known as the Flores settlement, that the president is now seeking to circumvent.</p>

<p>But unlike the order Trump ultimately signed, which was framed around a false premise that the Flores settlement requires families to be separated at the border, the boys’ complaint points to what the agreement actually says: that the U.S. government not engage in the prolonged and unnecessary detention of children.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, filed by the Aldea — People’s Justice Center and the Law Office of Amy Maldonado, reflects a narrative that has become common in recent weeks, as the implications of Trump’s “zero tolerance doctrine” evolved into a national scandal. The families came from a Latin American nation where the security situation is dire and sought refuge in the U.S., only to find themselves in a newly terrifying situation: separated by a government with no system in place to reunite the parents and kids that it is systematically tearing apart.</p>

<p>The boys, whose ordeal was first reported today by the Associated Press, are identified in their complaints by their initials. The 15-year-old is identified as W.S.R. and the 9-year-old is identified as C.D.A. According to their complaints, the boys, along with their fathers, came to the U.S. to seek asylum. Their individual experiences were distinct, though both families claim to have been targeted by organized crime. They crossed into the U.S. in late May, in New Mexico, more than a month after “zero tolerance” order went into effect.</p>

<p>In the case of 9-year-old C.D.A., the complaint claims that the father and the son attempted to enter the U.S. at a port of entry, as the administration has advised asylum-seekers to do, but were told it was “closed.” And so the pair crossed the border between ports. W.S.R. and his father did the same. They were promptly arrested by U.S. Border Patrol agents and, lawyers for the families say, expressed their desire to seek asylum.</p>

<p>It’s been nearly a month since the families were separated. Only one of the boys has been able to speak to his father.</p>

<p>It’s a pattern that Bridget Cambria, one of the attorneys for the two families, says is occurring with increasing regularity on the border. “Most of the people that we’ve heard from, they’ve all tried to present at a port of entry and they’re denied entry,” Cambria told The Intercept. “So that’s why they’re apprehended, primarily, because they’re seeking out a border officer to ask for protection.”</p>

<p>While the prevalence of that particular pattern could not be confirmed, The Intercept and several other news and legal advocacy organizations have documented numerous instances of border agents turning away asylum-seekers at ports of entry across the border, making it all but impossible for them to assert their right in the one manner deemed appropriate by the Trump administration.</p>

<p>The fathers were arrested, charged, and ultimately prosecuted for entering the country without inspection, a federal misdemeanor. The families spent two sleepless nights in a Border Patrol holding facility. One night, a U.S. official approached C.D.A., the 9-year-old, and his father. According to the boy’s complaint, the official told the father that the pair needed to be separated for a “process,” assuring him that it would only last three to five days, and then they would be reunited after. The reunification never happened. Karen Hoffmann, also an attorney working on the families’ case, says W.S.R. and his father were similarly separated. Hoffman said the boys were in tears and their fathers assured them, “I’ll see you soon. I promise I won’t let you be alone.”</p>

<p>“Basically, the U.S. government made liars out of them because it’s been almost a month,” Hoffmann told The Intercept. “They haven’t seen them. In one case, they still haven’t spoken.”</p>

<p>As sources working on family separation cases recently told The Intercept, and as U.S. officials confirmed Wednesday, the U.S. government has no dedicated system in place to reunite the thousands of families it has separated across the border. In both C.D.A.’s and W.S.R.’s cases, their complaints state that their fathers were given no information about their sons’ whereabouts following their separation. The boys were both shipped to Chicago, while the fathers entered U.S. Marshal custody. As of Wednesday’s filings, C.D.A.’s father still did not know the name of the facility where his elementary school-age son was being kept.</p>

<p>According to W.S.R.’s complaint, it took his father three weeks to obtain the hotline number the government is providing to parents whose children it has taken. In their one and only conversation since being separated, W.S.R.’s father expressed that his son is “extremely unhappy and upset and is desperate to be reunited with his father.” According to C.D.A.’s complaint, his father obtained the government’s hotline number as well, which is managed by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the Health and Human Services department responsible for the custody of minors in the immigration system.</p>

<p>The father tried calling the number “repeatedly,” the complaint states. “He says they took his information and told him they would call him back,” it goes on to say. “He has not managed to find out if he can receive calls at the detention center where he is.”</p>

<p>The fathers of the two boys are currently being held in detention centers in New Mexico and Texas, where they are awaiting interviews with asylum officers to make their claims.</p>

<p>Lawyers for the families argue that the ongoing detention of the two boys is a clear-cut violation of the Flores settlement, a 1997 federal consent decree that limits the amount of time the government can keep a child in detention and stipulates a series of protections for kids in U.S. custody.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Obama administration responded to an increase in Central American women and children showing up to the border by dramatically expanding the use of family detention. The courts ultimately intervened, ruling that the government, in general, could not hold unaccompanied children or children apprehended with a family member in detention for more than 20 days. Instead, families were to be released on parole as their immigration cases proceeded through the courts.</p>

<p>Far right, anti-immigrant hawks in and around the Trump administration, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and White House adviser Steven Miller, have long hated the settlement, casting it as a “loophole” routinely exploited by women and kids. The administration has insisted that the only way forward is through detention, arguing that if families are released into the community, they will simply disappear.</p>

<p>The Flores settlement requires that children not be held for more than 20 days. It also requires “contact with family members who were arrested with the minor.”</p>

<p>It’s a false dilemma. As the Women’s Refugee Commission, which routinely deals with families in the immigration system, recently noted, “the government can also place families into alternative to detention (ATD) programs. Unfortunately, the government eliminated one of its most promising and cost-effective ATD programs – the Family Case Management Program (FCMP) – last year, despite the fact that it is far more appropriate for families seeking asylum than either detention or separation.”</p>

<p>Under Flores, the attorneys say, both of the Brazilian boys have the right to challenge the government’s decision to place them with ORR. In both cases, the complaints contend, the boys were separated “without any consideration given to the irreparable psychological and physical damage that separation causes to children and without reason. There were, at no time, any assertions of abuse, neglect, or parental unfitness, nor were any hearings or process conducted of any kind by the government prior to the decision to separate.”</p>

<p>In addition to allegedly trespassing against the Fifth Amendment, “which does not and cannot permit the United States government to forcibly separate an asylum-seeking family, a father from a son, without justification or hearing,” the complaints cite several alleged violations the Flores settlement. Under Flores, the complaints note, government agencies involved in the detention of children are “to treat all minors in its custody with dignity, respect and special concern for their particular vulnerability as minors.” This includes placing children “in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the minor’s age and special needs.” The complaint argues that “a separated child is not placed in the least restrictive setting appropriate when the child is apprehended with their parent.”</p>

<p>The Flores settlement provides several protections for children in detention. In addition to requiring that children not be held for more than 20 days, the settlement requires that children be provided clean drinking water, food, and medical care. It also requires “contact with family members who were arrested with the minor.” In the case of the boys from Brazil, their attorneys argue that the government has failed to meet this requirement. The complaints go on to note that, under Flores, the government’s first preference should always be to reunite a child with their parent whenever possible. Rather than abiding by the Flores settlement and seeking the least restrictive solution to the presence of these two asylum-seeking families in the U.S., the complaints argue that the government has embraced the most punishing course of action possible.</p>

<p>In his executive order Wednesday, Trump called on Sessions to file a request with U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify Flores “in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings.” On Thursday, the motion was filed. The move is a clear attempt on the part of the administration to do away with the Flores agreement, thus allowing the government to detain immigrant families as long as it needs to adjudicate their immigration cases. With the immigration court backlog being what it is, that could mean that asylum-seekers with viable cases could spend months or years behind bars.</p>

<p>Though it ostensibly called for an end to family separations as they have played out in recent weeks, there were mixed reports describing the current status of the administration’s “zero tolerance” campaign in the wake of Trump’s executive order Thursday. But with thousands of families already separated, and children scattered across the country, the question of how reunification will proceed remains urgent. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a class-action lawsuit calling on the government to reunite parents held in immigration detention with their children.</p>

<p>In a phone call with reporters on Thursday, Lee Gelernt, the veteran attorney leading the ACLU’s suit, said his organization doubts that Flores can be overturned by Congress or the courts. “The reason is because it’s based on the Constitution,” Gelernt said. “The due process clause of the Constitution required this settlement.” The ACLU is currently seeking a nationwide preliminary injunction to immediately reunify the children who have been separated from their parents. The story of the second plaintiff in the ACLU’s suit, also a Brazilian, is remarkably similar to the experiences of C.D.A., W.S.R., and their fathers. The only difference, Cambria, the attorney, said, is that after the ACLU sued, the families were reunited.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has repeatedly insisted that the Flores settlement requires the separation of children from their parents, and that it needs to be torn up so that the government does not have to separate families. The settlement requires no such thing. “We’re going to have an interesting talk when we go to court about who Flores actually protects, which is the child and their interests,” Cambria said. “They don’t want to overturn Flores because they care about keeping children with their parents. They want to overturn Flores because then it will contribute to a mass increase in incarceration of families and children, and they will profit off of them.”</p>

<p>“The point of this is not to bring families together,” she added. “The point of it is to eliminate the protections and the rights that children have in detention. And it’s disgusting.”</p>

<h2 id="trumpinsiderwantedtosellsocialmediasurveillancetoolstoabusivegovernmentsleakeddocumentssuggest">Trump Insider Wanted to Sell Social Media Surveillance Tools to Abusive Governments, Leaked Documents Suggest</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Sam Biddle</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-21</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/22/broidy-circinus-spying-tunisia-romania-uae/ </p>

<p>Earlier this year, it was reported that Elliott Broidy, a convicted felon in a 2009 bribery case and a top Donald Trump fundraiser, proffered meetings with the president to foreign regimes who were also potential clients of his defense firm Circinus. Little is known about Circinus, but purported company documents obtained by The Intercept contain plans to peddle social media surveillance software to repressive regimes.</p>

<p>The Circinus website paints the contractor as an red-blooded defender of U.S. national security: “Are you a patriot determined to keep our country—both government and private industry—safe?” its careers page reads. Circinus’ executive roster boasts experience in U.S. Special Forces, Homeland Security, and military intelligence. But the documents, a series of pitch decks, indicate the company was prepared to sell what’s described as a suite of sophisticated internet-mining tools to the governments of Cyprus, Romania, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates, touting the ability to detect and identify online “detractors.” The recent histories of Tunisia and the UAE are rife with human rights abuses, including crackdowns against political dissent.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the pitches were actually presented to any or all of the countries in question, but the New York Times in March identified Romania, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates as prospective Circinus clients. The newspaper described meetings between Broidy and officials from Romania and Tunisia, as well as reporting that Broidy wrote to others about efforts to win business from the UAE.</p>

<p>The Tunisian pitch claimed that Circinus’ software could detect online “detractors” of the state.</p>

<p>The presentations obtained by The Intercept, dated 2016 and 2017, focus on the collection of so-called “open source intelligence,” referred to as “OSINT” throughout. This is a flashy way of describing information that can be freely accessed online, such as tweets, blog posts, and any other content not locked behind a password. Although typically not as sensitive as the content people keep stored privately, internet users frequently leave trails of “open source” breadcrumbs across the web that can be used for compromising purposes. Harvesting social media sites like Facebook and LinkedIn en masse is generally frowned upon as invasive by users and web companies alike, especially given how difficult it is for most people to properly configure the privacy settings on a service like Facebook. But this is no issue, according to the documents: “If it is on the World Wide Web,” reads a pitch to the government of Cyprus, “it can be ingested by the Circinus Open Source Analytics Center’s analytical platform.” According to the materials, Circinus’ ingestion of online information often involved a process known as scraping, in which content is anonymously downloaded and information of interest is filtered from it. The documents further claimed Circinus could “scrape the entire web, including blogs, newsfeeds, video, comments on news sites and a range of other sources in all languages and from all countries.” But, unlike the myriad marketing firms that advertise their ability to scrape Twitter and sell you some sort of “insight,” Circinus is a defense contractor and in the documents is positioned as a potential partner to intelligence agencies and policymakers both foreign and domestic.</p>

<p>In a lawsuit filed this past March, Broidy alleged he is the victim of a politically motivated hacking campaign executed by the government of Qatar, and that files stolen from him by the hackers were subsequently distributed to members of the press. The suit alleges the hackers have “doctored or wholly forged” some of these documents, though it cites zero examples, nor have any faked or altered materials been reported by the press.</p>

<p>Circinus would not comment on the authenticity of of the documents without being provided with full copies, but did characterize the pitches as having been “stolen.” The Intercept was unable to verify the authenticity of the documents, but the services described are exactly the sort of offerings Circinus markets publicly. A company spokesperson also answered questions about the substance of the documents without dispute, confirming that “three of the countries listed received capabilities briefs based on interest,” but that “the other one was built for consideration to determine if there was a compelling case but never gained interest.” The spokesperson also said that the aforementioned countries “had key events in their recent past that clearly could benefit from the analysis of Publicly Available Information,” and that such analysis “could be tailored to the customer’s interest.”</p>

<p>The embassies of Cyprus, Tunisia, Romania, and the UAE did not return requests for comment.</p>

<p>The buzzword-laden presentations are at once both ominous and vague: The Cypriot pitch claims Circinus could help that government’s “influence” and “targeting” abilities, while a social media geolocation feature could help at a “tactical level” by letting “agents in the field [identify] Social Media traffic in real-time, on the street where they are operating.” The Tunisian pitch went further, claiming that Circinus’ software could detect online “detractors” of the state, as well as “identify not just the nature of the Information but also significant information about the individual from whom the relevant Open Source Information originated.” Elsewhere, that same document expands on this “identity resolution” feature, what it defines as “the ability to resolve multiple online identities or personas to assist the government in conducting background investigations and for vetting applicants seeking legal immigration status:”</p>

<p>A government will be able to use meta-data and a complex “fuzzy matching” process to match online personas, both real and alias, to provide a quantifiable level of confidence that two “data-supported” identities are the same. By accumulating identity context over time, a government will be able to use various sources of information to determine whether individuals really are who they say they are. Once identified, Circinus’ software can determine the links between individuals and organizations. Linking individuals, organizations and addresses enables the discovery and analysis of both loosely and tightly-coupled networks, providing a more complete intelligence view that multiplies the effectiveness of conventional Open Source Information collection and analysis.</p>

<p>These capabilities were ostensibly offered in service of what remains an oppressive state. Tunisian civil liberties have changed radically since the overthrow of dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in 2011 but, as recently as last year, a Tunisian blogger was imprisoned for making “defamatory” statements against the government on Facebook. The human rights watchdog Freedom House rates the country’s internet policies as only “partly free,” owing to concerns over anti-dissent crackdowns. “Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees continued in an environment of impunity,” Amnesty International wrote of the country, heading into 2018. “Prosecutions of peaceful protesters increased in several regions.”</p>

<p>The contents of the presentation made for the government of the UAE are unknown; The Intercept was provided with only a cover page. But the formatting and file name of this document suggests it contained similar services related to the processing of online information. Dissent of any kind, whether online or off, is even more brutally punished in the UAE than Tunisia: In March 2017, the same date as the UAE pitch document, Emirati academic Nasser bin Ghaith was sentenced to a 10-year prison term for comments he made on Twitter. Earlier this month, the award-winning Emirati human rights advocate Ahmed Mansoor was sentenced to his own 10 year term for “insulting the UAE and its leaders” online, reported The National, a newspaper based in Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p>“Whether Circinus is selling advanced analytics or snake oil, it still raises a number of serious concerns.”</p>

<p>It’s common for defense and security firms around the world to sell their wares to less than upstanding regimes and immediately dust their hands of any further culpability. Defenders of such software will claim it’s up to the customer to use or abuse what they say is a neutral tool that can’t be policed by its makers. But what was sold in the pitches wasn’t just the power of Circinus software but also the formation of an ongoing collaboration between the foreign customer and a dedicated team of Americans working out of Virginia — what the pitches call the “Circinus OSINT Center.” One page in the Cyprus document notes that the use of a U.S.-based team would effectively mask the Cypriot government’s use of its technology, shielding the government from “the risk of being exposed to Google analytics or compromising the IP addresses of the machine or network originating the search.” The pitch here appears to be advertising the ability to essentially launder web-based surveillance through the United States, a feature the document refers to as a “misattributed environment.”</p>

<p>This apparent collision of Trumpism, surveillance, and repressive governance is naturally worrying to privacy advocates. Edin Omanovic, head of the State Surveillance Program at Privacy International, told The Intercept that although “Trump came into power promising to drain the swamp… the biggest personal winners from his presidency so far are well-connected business and military people who make up the U.S. military-industrial complex.” Omanovic added, “That large security companies can auction off access to him in such a way should be telling for anyone who still believes he is in any way different to the deep state he pretends to rail against.”</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Omanovic issued a note of caution. “Claims by surveillance companies always need to be taken skeptically,” he said. “Whether Circinus is selling advanced analytics or snake oil, it still raises a number of serious concerns.”</p>

<p>Some signs in the documents certainly point toward snake oil. The materials are self-aggrandizing and over the top, needlessly deploying spook-speak acronyms — PAI, for Publicly Available Information, for instance — and capitalizing random words for apparent dramatic effect, such as “Open Source Information.” Barely intelligible phrases — like “analyze Open Source Information in order to get the most actionable OSINT from the Open Source Information and the other proprietary data” — are the norm, with such an emphasis on empty jargon and buzzwords that the convoluted frequently veers into the incoherent. The language makes it difficult to assess how realistic anything in the pitches really was.</p>

<p>According to Chris Parsons, a research associate at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, ineffective or outright fraudulent intelligence software can be just as dangerous as the real thing. “Many automated OSINT tools are as much snake oil as they are useful,” Parsons said. “It may actually be more worrying if the product is bad, should it produce information that is highly inaccurate, analyses which are deeply deficient, or inferences of threats which are grossly exaggerated.” If Circinus is selling software that doesn’t work or grossly overstates its effectiveness, Parsons added, it’s all the more likely that “individuals may be detrimentally affected by subsequent state activities regardless of their innocence or noninvolvement in activities that state authorities are monitoring.”</p>

<p>In response to questions about potential human rights implications of its software sales, the company spokesperson said, “Circinus maintains a rigorous compliance program with continuous review,” and that “there are policies and practices in place that ensure all regulations are met as well as a quality assurance program that prevents the disclosure of protected or guarded information.” This spokesperson continued:</p>

<p>Circinus focuses on the themes being spread via social and publicly available broadcast media, focusing specifically on trending topics and the locations those topics are most prominent. While our analysts do identify influencers and their networks, Circinus does not provide the client with user-associated personally identifiable information (PII), which might be used for targeting purposes. Furthermore, our analytic lines of effort are oriented against external actors with the intended purpose of providing indications and warning of potential threats planned by hostile nations states and violent extremist organizations against our clients and their interests.</p>

<p>The company did not respond when asked how the purpoted Circinus “Identity Resolution” feature described in the documents — specifically as giving the ability to let a government “determine whether individuals really are who they say they are” online — is not an instance at least offering to “provide the client with user-associated personally identifiable information.”</p>

<p id="byline">by: Debbie Nathan</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-21</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/21/trump-family-separation-immigration-children-reunification/ </p>

<p>A Guatemalan woman whose child was taken from her last month by immigration authorities in Texas after coming to the U.S. seeking asylum was released after 38 days in detention last week. Immediately after being freed, she went to the federally funded facility that was managing her 5-year-old son’s care and recovered him.</p>

<p>Immigrants rights activists and attorneys say this may be the first such family — at least in Texas — to be separated and then reunited since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on May 7 that migrant parents and their children at the border would be split up and the children put into government holding centers and foster care. On June 19, a Border Patrol spokesperson told reporters that 2,342 children were taken from their parents between May 5 and June 9 as a result of the “zero tolerance” “prosecution initiative.” There is poor coordination between Customs and Border Patrol, which takes the children, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which puts them into shelters and foster care. As a result, many parents and children don’t know one another’s whereabouts. Mothers and fathers are being deported while their sons and daughters remain in the U.S. The Guatemalan woman and her child were luckier.</p>

<p>The Intercept learned of their case on May 12, four days after they were separated. We have given the mother the pseudonym Delia to protect her from U.S. government retaliation. She crossed into the U.S. at Brownsville, Texas, on May 7 and was separated from her son the next morning. More than six weeks later — last Friday — The Intercept was present when she was freed, days after an asylum officer ruled that she demonstrated “credible fear” of returning to Guatemala.</p>

<p>When I first interviewed Delia on May 13, she was locked in a detention center in Laredo, Texas. She’d been bussed there three days after crossing the Rio Grande with her child on an inner tube. She was detained on the bank of the river by Border Patrol agents. Hours later, her child was taken from her, screaming.</p>

<p>During our interview, Delia wept constantly and seemed dazed from the shock of losing her son. She knew where he was — San Antonio — because a family member had been notified, but she had not been able to speak with him.</p>

<p>Delia said she’d fled Guatemala with the boy because her partner, the child’s father, had been beating her, cutting her, and threatening to kill her and their son. She was looking for help in the U.S. and never imagined that her claim of domestic violence would be laughed at and mocked by the Border Patrol agents who processed her, or that she and her son would be separated amid the sound of his panicked screams. She said the Laredo detention center held several women besides her who had also been criminally charged for illegal entry and separated from their kids.</p>

<p>To learn what relief might or might not be available to detainees such as Delia, The Intercept contacted attorneys and staff members of organizations in Texas who are loosely organized and advocate together for immigrants and asylum-seekers.</p>

<p>Many have for years been offering free and low-cost immigration legal services. Others have sued the government for violating immigrants’ rights under the Constitution and immigration law. By late May, they had gone into high gear in response to Sessions’s new family separation policy.</p>

<p>The groups and individuals range from nonprofit legal services organizations, solo practitioners, and lawyers in small firms, to activist groups and huge corporate law firms. In south Texas, these partners include the Alamo office of the Texas Civil Rights Project, Laredo solo practitioner Ricardo de Anda, and the global white-shoe law firm Jones Day. Austin first responders include the University of Texas School of Law Immigration Clinic, Austin Region Justice for Our Neighbors, the two-lawyer office of Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch and her associate Cori Hash, and the Hutto Visitation Program of Grassroots Leadership. Tahirih Justice Center, a center for immigrant women’s rights in Houston, acted quickly to gather information to inform separated parents of how to find their children; the Houston Immigration Legal Services Collective is working to coordinate representation. RAICES Texas, in San Antonio, did the same and mounted a social media campaign to raise funds to bond parents out of detention — by this week, their appeal on Facebook had gone viral and raised almost $20 million.</p>

<p>Virginia Raymond, legal director of Austin Region Justice for Our Neighbors, has on and off been doing immigration-rights activism and practicing immigration law for over 30 years. For the past five years, she has been a denizen of immigration courts, where she represents immigrants trying to remain in the U.S. Many are seeking asylum.</p>

<p>Raymond volunteered to speak with Delia after she was transferred from Laredo to the T. Don Hutto Residential Center, about 40 miles from her home in Austin. It is now a women immigrant detention center run by the private prison company CoreCivic, and holds some 3,000 detainees. Hutto used to be a medium-security state prison. The remnants of that history remain evident: the visiting room, for instance, allows people to sit together on sofas, but visible from the sofas is a long bank where inmates used to sit on one side and their visitors on another, divided by glass. There are still guards everywhere, visitors must pass through an X-ray machine, and the residents wear institutional clothing.</p>

<p>Raymond drove to Hutto on Sunday, May 27. Delia did not know she was coming: “When the staff said, ‘Your lawyer is here,’ I said, ‘What lawyer?’” But she spoke with Raymond, and the day after this exploratory visit, she had a pro bono attorney.</p>

<p>Listening to Delia’s account of why she left Guatemala, Raymond concluded that she had a strong domestic violence asylum claim. She explained to Delia what would happen when she was interviewed by an asylum officer. During this exchange, which is called a “credible fear” interview, the migrant answers questions about why she is afraid to return to her country. When interviewees pass, they are often released from detention, typically by posting bond. They may then live in the U.S. while awaiting a trial before an immigration judge who will decide if they merit asylum. The wait is long. Immigration courts currently are so backlogged that it takes an average of almost two years for a case to be resolved.</p>

<p>Raymond was optimistic that Delia would pass her credible fear interview. But neither the attorney nor her client knew when it would occur.</p>

<p>On June 6, Raymond happened to be at Hutto to meet another woman who’d lost her child. In the visiting room, she learned by chance from a staffer that Delia was sitting in a “courtroom,” as the staffer called it. There is no courtroom at Hutto, Raymond said, but there is a space about the size of a small home bathroom, where credible fear interviews are held. Shocked that she had not been notified so she could represent her client, Raymond rushed into the little room. Delia was there and about to be questioned by a disembodied voice on a telephone — an asylum officer from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service. USCIS is the federal agency that conducts and adjudicates credible fear hearings.</p>

<p>With Raymond at Delia’s side, the questions began. They were standard at first, such as “What is your name?” and “Your birthday?” When the USCIS agent asked, “Do you have any children?” Delia answered that she had one. Then the hearing officer asked, “So your child is still living in Guatemala?”</p>

<p>Delia looked at Raymond, confused. Raymond was flummoxed. “Even three months ago, that would have been a reasonable question,” she says. “But not now.”</p>

<p>“No,” Delia answered the officer. “He was taken from me.”</p>

<p>“What?” said the officer.</p>

<p>“They took him at the border.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Delia.</p>

<p>“Who took him?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“It became clear,” Raymond says, “that as late as June 6, the asylum officer had no idea that children were being separated from their parents at the border. Was he not reading newspapers or watching TV? It boggled my mind that he didn’t know.” As Delia’s attorney, Raymond was able to explain to the officer the new “zero tolerance” policy and Sessions’s May 7 announcement — made the same day Delia was apprehended — that children would be taken from their parents.</p>

<p>Over the phone, she heard the officer shuffling papers. He told Raymond he was consulting a memo dated June 1. “Oh! I see now,” he said. Then he apologized to Delia about her little boy being taken: “I’m sorry this happened to you. It’s not right.”</p>

<p>Raymond left the hearing feeling shaken. It was bad enough that the Office of Refugee Resettlement and Immigration and Customs Enforcement weren’t communicating when children were taken from parents. But it seemed that USCIS was also disconnected. What if Raymond had not been at the credible fear interview to explain current events — major immigration events — to the immigration official? Delia had obtained Raymond’s pro bono counsel practically by chance. What about all the parents, in all the detention centers, with all their children gone, who had no lawyers?</p>

<p>Five days later, on June 11, Jeff Sessions announced that he was exercising his authority as attorney general to cancel domestic violence as a valid reason to grant asylum. Domestic violence, Sessions said, is a private problem, having nothing to do with state action or inaction.</p>

<p>Raymond says that Sessions’s decision is a blanket statement of general policy, whereas asylum claims are adjudicated individually. She believes that lawyers can still prevail in domestic violence claims on a case-by-case basis, because such claims have always required proof that an asylum seeker belongs to a particular social group, is persecuted because of her membership in that group, and that the government in her home country is unwilling or unable to protect her. The difference now, Raymond says, is that “lawyers will need to more carefully and precisely identify the asylum seeker’s particular social group. Asylum seekers who are representing themselves, with humble education and unfamiliarity with U.S. law, are not likely to be able to successfully articulate their claims.” Without lawyers, Raymond says, these women will be harmed by the Sessions decision.</p>

<p>That was Raymond’s fear for the future. For the present, she was worried that Sessions’ ruling could endanger Delia’s credible-fear determination.</p>

<p>Raymond and her client did not learn until the afternoon of June 14 that Delia’s claim had been approved on June 10, just one day before the Sessions ruling. Her bond had been set at $1,500. On Friday morning, while her husband hurried to the bank to withdraw funds from their own account, Raymond corresponded with the child’s case worker, making arrangements for Delia to be reunited that day with her son. Then she drove to Hutto.</p>

<p>While she waited for paperwork to be processed, the staff dealt with Delia. “Clean your bed because you’re going today, right now,” she remembers them saying. Delia started jumping up and down, and the women incarcerated with her applauded. They knew she would soon be reunited with her son, she said. They had “seen me crying every day and night.”</p>

<p>Delia had spent about six weeks in regulation shower shoes and clothes that looked like cheap medical scrubs. Now she walked out of the detention center in street clothes. Soon she was in Raymond’s car, with Raymond and her husband, this reporter, and a videographer, driving to pick up Delia’s son.</p>

<p>We drove two hours to BCFS Health and Human Services, a non-profit in San Antonio with a contract from the Office of Refugee Resettlement to shelter and manage care for children who have been taken from their parents at the border. On the way, Delia used Raymond’s cellphone to excitedly call her parents in Guatemala. “The storm is passed and I’m free!” she told them. “Free!” “Tell the village to light fireworks!” She hung up and started sobbing. She said she badly needed an embrace. “In detention, they would not let any of us even touch each others’ hands, much less hug.”</p>

<p>The BCFS building is located on a grassy street in northwest San Antonio and looks blockish but benign — with its pleasant but locked outdoor playground and smoked-glass windows, the facility has the air of a pediatric oncology hospital. BCFS used to stand for Baptist Child and Family Services; it was founded in 1944 and used to be small orphanage. Today it is a global enterprise that contracts with the federal government to provide temporary shelter and emergency services after disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and — lately — removals of migrant children from their parents. It is the second-largest operation for this purpose in the country after Southwest Key, whose Brownsville, Texas, facility has lately become infamous as an overcrowded warehouse for migrant children. In 2016, the last year for which its tax records are publicly available, BCFS received almost $288 million in government funding. It cares for more than 4,000 immigrant children nationally, including over 1,000 in San Antonio.</p>

<p>Still: Verónica G. Cárdenas for The Intercept</p>

<p>It appears that BCFS will soon be expanding. Its Facebook page advertises for jobs in Texas as “Disaster Case Managers” to work with “youth separated from their families” — English-Spanish speaking applicants preferred. Another ad calls the need for such employees “urgent.”</p>

<p>The Intercept called BCFS Health and Human Services and asked to speak with a representative about the organization’s work and facilities for migrant children separated from their parents. We were given a phone number for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Administration for Families and Children in Washington, D.C. HHS did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>With Raymond and her husband, Delia walked through BCFS’s doors into an air-conditioned reception area. The videographer and I waited outside. Minutes later, the child emerged in his mother’s arms. He is small for his age. He wore a crisp, white polo shirt. He smelled like soap and shampoo, and someone had combed styling gel into his hair. He looked blank, startled by the adults surrounding him, including his mother. Then he settled into Delia’s embrace and everyone piled back in the car. The plan was for mother and son to spend the night at Raymond’s home in Austin while she scheduled them for a weekend flight to another part of the U.S., where Delia’s family and friends were waiting.</p>

<p>During the ride back to Austin, her son soon became smiley and animated. “They gave me a toothbrush! And toothpaste!” “We drew pictures.” “We went to a fair and there was a big roller coaster!” “Hey look, an airplane!”</p>

<p>But then, as he twined into his mother’s neck. “I cried some, but I tried to be strong,” he said. “The girl who took care of me, she could hug me. But no one else could. The children couldn’t touch each other at all. They told us we had to have espacio personal.”</p>

<p>Back at Raymond’s house, Delia and her son stayed up half the night bonding again: chatting, cuddling, giggling, and kissing. On Saturday night, the boy screamed in his sleep. Delia stroked and hugged him awake, and asked what he’d been dreaming about. He said he didn’t know. On Sunday, Raymond put the two of them on a plane. By Monday, she was at work on other cases.</p>

<p>Late yesterday, on June 20, Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending child separations and directing immigration authorities to detain parents and children together indefinitely. The order conflicts with the 1997 Flores settlement, a federal consent decree prohibiting the detention of children for more than 20 days, and will likely face multiple court challenges. The order did not address how the U.S. government plans to reunite the thousands of families it has already separated.</p>

<p>Correction: June 21, 2018</p>

<p>Because of a typo, this article previously stated that BCFS manages the care of more than 7,000 immigrant children. It has been updated to the correct figure, which is more than 4,000 immigrant children.</p>

<h2 id="trumpszerotolerancecrackdownwontstopbordercrossingsbutitcouldbreakthecourts">Trump’s “Zero Tolerance” Crackdown Won’t Stop Border Crossings but It Could Break the Courts</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ryan Devereaux</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-12</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/12/border-zero-tolerance-immigration-family-separation-operation-streamline/ </p>

<p>A little over two months ago, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order to U.S. prosecutors with the potential to break the core functions of the Department of Justice. The directive called on U.S. attorneys to criminally prosecute everybody arrested for crossing the U.S.-Mexico border between lawful ports of entry. The order made no exceptions for first-time offenders, asylum-seekers, or parents with small children. “You are the front lines of this battle,” Sessions told his attorneys, calling the new initiative a program of “zero tolerance.”</p>

<p>As far back as last year, the administration has signaled plans to target parents who illegally cross the border with the full force of the law and separate them from their children in the process. Through wrenching stories of what zero tolerance looks like in practice, many Americans have now seen, for the first time, dramatic representations of a phenomenon more than two decades in the making — the criminalization of unauthorized migration — colliding with the agenda of an administration inflicting as much punishment as possible on undocumented immigrants as a matter of strategy.</p>

<p>Hundreds of children are now being separated from their parents in courts along the border every week, with little to no system in place to reconnect those families as they pass through the criminal justice and immigration systems. With shelters for children separated from their parents rapidly hitting capacity, the Trump administration is actively exploring ways to lock up immigrant kids on U.S. military bases, including, according to a recent McClatchy report, through the use of “tent cities.” As for the adults caught in the zero tolerance push, Reuters reported last week that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was beginning the transfer of roughly 1,600 detainees to a handful of federal prisons across the country.</p>

<p>At the moment, the administration is operating nowhere near 100 percent zero tolerance. If it were to get there, the system would likely collapse. While referrals of migrants for prosecution are definitely on the rise — with 30,000 referrals from October to April, compared to 18,642 in all of fiscal year 2017 — “the current level is about one-fifth of all apprehended adult border-crossers,” Adam Isacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, noted in a column last month. By pushing to bring that level up to 100 percent, as Sessions has ordered, “the Trump administration is embarking on a course of action that could cause the federal government’s courts, ports of entry, and prisons to collapse,” Isacson argued. Hundreds of thousands of border crossers would be locked up annually in federal prisons under a fully enforced zero tolerance doctrine, he wrote, and the federal docket could be expected to balloon by 270 percent.</p>

<p>Doubling Down on Failure</p>

<p>Trumpian zero tolerance is a combination of policies new and old. The most critical new component is that, in its quest to prosecute 100 percent of all people who cross the border illegally, the administration is separating families in waves, pulling apart parents and kids who would have likely stayed together in years past. Virtually everything else the administration is doing on the border is the ramped-up version of a decadesold strategy that has consistently failed to achieve its stated objectives.</p>

<p>The administration’s evolving crackdown has critical implications for asylum-seekers in particular. On Monday, Sessions issued a decision overturning an Obama-era precedent that will now make it exceedingly difficult for migrants to seek asylum on the basis of domestic violence and gang violence. Both are particularly common claims among Central American asylum-seekers. “This just told thousands of battered women and children that the United States will not afford them protection under the law,” a senior Department of Homeland Security immigration official told The Intercept.</p>

<p>While Sessions and the administration take the position that most asylum-seekers are frauds undertaking perilous journeys in order to scam the government, they have said that migrants who present themselves at lawful ports of entry seeking asylum have nothing to worry about. More than a year’s worth of news stories and an ongoing class-action lawsuit suggest otherwise, with accounts from across the border describing immigration officials blocking or turning away asylum-seekers exercising their rights at U.S. ports. What’s more, as Isacson noted, if the tens of thousands of asylum-seekers who present themselves between ports of entry each year reversed course and began showing up at the nation’s 45 understaffed ports of entry, those ports would be quickly overwhelmed.</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union is currently challenging the administration’s family separation practices as they pertain to asylum-seekers. The organization, in a class-action suit, points to the experiences of two mothers. The first, identified as Ms. L, is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo who last year came to the U.S. following an exhaustive journey with her then-6-year-old daughter. According to the ACLU, Ms. L did exactly as the administration has prescribed: She presented herself at a lawful port of entry and said she was seeking asylum. Ms. L and her daughter were placed in detention, and after a few days, the two were “forcibly separated.” Ms. L’s daughter was sent to a shelter more than 1,000 miles away, where she remained for four months.</p>

<p>The second plaintiff in the suit, identified as Ms. C., did not present herself at a lawful port entry. Instead, she and her son crossed the border in Texas between ports, flagged down a Border Patrol agent, and then asked to apply for asylum. Ms. C. was arrested, prosecuted, and served 25 days in federal custody before being handed off to immigration authorities. Ms. C’s son was taken away following her arrest and moved to a shelter hundreds of miles away in Chicago. Ms. C completed her sentence in September of last year. She was moved into immigration custody, where she successfully began the asylum process. Still, the government kept Ms. C separated from her son. The pair were finally reunited last week.</p>

<p>While the lawsuit does not challenge the lawfulness of these prosecutions, Lee Gelernt, a veteran ACLU attorney arguing the case, says the government’s targeting of asylum-seekers who appear between ports of entry is a serious problem. “They should not be first prosecuting and then seeing whether you’re a bona fide asylum-seeker,” Gelernt told The Intercept recently. In the event that an asylum-seeker is prosecuted, however, the ACLU argues that they should be reunited with their child after their time is served, provided there is no evidence that they are unfit. “What we’re saying in the lawsuit is if you’re going to prosecute asylum-seekers and you’re going to take the children away, give the child back. You’ve got to give the child back.”</p>

<p>As Gelernt noted, the core question being considered in the ACLU’s case is somewhat narrow: the legality of the prolonged separation of parents from their children in immigration custody absent a determination that those parents are unfit. But the broader concerns raised in the case go to the heart of the zero tolerance campaign. In the case of Ms. C, the government arrested a mother seeking asylum because she did so between lawful ports of entry — in essence, she broke a law to exercise a right. According to the Washington Post, more than 20,000 migrants sought asylum by crossing the border illegally from October through December. In the past, cases like Ms. C’s were treated inconsistently. In some sectors, the Border Patrol would turn over asylum-seekers picked up between ports, particularly those with children, to immigration authorities, rather than referring them to the Department of Justice for prosecution.</p>

<p>Under zero tolerance, these acts of prosecutorial discretion are out. Those picked up between ports of entry, including parents and asylum-seekers, will appear in one of several courts along the border that feature mass prosecutions often facilitated through Operation Streamline, the U.S. government program designed to funnel bodies, as Border Patrol agents call them, through the criminal justice system, then out of the country, as quickly as possible. In its 13-year history, Streamline has been criticized as a ghastly example of conveyor belt justice, a mockery of due process that no decent American would ever accept for themselves, their loved ones, or their neighbors. The Trump administration sees it differently.</p>

<p>Sessions highlighted Streamline, specifically, as a model of success in his April directive. “Past prosecution initiatives in certain districts — such as Operation Streamline — led to a decrease in illegal activities in those districts,” he wrote. Streamline prosecutions in Southern Arizona have jumped 71 percent this fiscal year, with the chief district judge saying the courts can’t handle any more. Nationally, federal criminal prosecutions, Streamline or otherwise, of individuals accused of illegally crossing the border increased by 60 percent from January to April, according to government data obtained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.</p>

<p>Administration officials say these ramped-up efforts are simply about enforcing the law, but the politics are obvious. Last year, Trump was able to brag about a historic drop in border apprehensions being a sign that he was living up to campaign promises. That’s not the case anymore. The administration line is that a “surge” in illegal crossings is to blame. That’s a misleading claim. In 2017, border apprehension levels did drop to record lows, and it’s true that apprehensions have risen in the last three months. But, as the Migration Policy Institute noted in an analysis last week, “What has been lost in the discussion is that the 2017 apprehensions are the outliers, and so measuring current activity at the border against that atypically low period ignores the fact that the current apprehensions picture largely mirrors earlier years.” MPI research assistant Jessica Bolter and Doris Meissner, former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, observed that this year’s March, April, and May apprehension numbers “are largely comparable to the same months in 2013, 2014, and 2016,” adding that the “40,344 apprehensions recorded in May 2018 are continuing the downward trend that has emerged over the past 18 years.”</p>

<p>To the extent that there is any notable uptick regarding people crossing the border, Bolter and Meissner went on to say, it’s in “the proportion of migrants that are either traveling as unaccompanied children or as families consisting of both adults and children.” Those numbers have been going up the past few years, and those are the people now in the crosshairs of the administration’s shock and awe campaign. This is the population that Manuel Padilla Jr., former Border Patrol chief for the Tucson sector, now running operations in the Rio Grande Valley, calls “non-impactable traffic” — individuals for whom no level of enforcement will serve as a deterrence. Sessions appears set on proving the veteran Border Patrol chief wrong, by showing that everyone is impactable. Through zero tolerance, the administration intends to deter people considering crossing the border illegally by making an example of others. It seems tearing babies and toddlers from their parents and letting that idea marinate in the minds of would-be migrants is now part of that strategy.</p>

<p>Deterrence, broadly, has been the guiding strategy of U.S. border enforcement since the Clinton administration. It was in 1994 that a collection of Border Patrol chiefs and Pentagon planners drew up “Prevention Through Deterrence,” the national border strategy designed to funnel border crossers away from border cities and into remote areas like the Sonoran Desert. While the strategy has shifted migration flows away from urban centers, it has also fueled an explosion in migrant deaths across the border over the last two decades. Streamline, and now Sessions’s zero tolerance initiative, are an extension of the same line of thinking: that if the right combination of enforcement efforts is arrayed to make unlawful border crossing sufficiently risky or punishing, people will stop crossing.</p>

<p>While the logic is straightforward, years of research strongly suggests that various enforcement strategies have little effect on migration flows. In 2015, a report published by the Office of the Inspector General for the Department of Homeland Security found that in the case of Streamline specifically, the Border Patrol did “not fully and accurately” measure the program’s “effect on deterring aliens from entering and re-entering the country illegally.” Additionally, the OIG’s office found that the Border Patrol lacked consistent guidance on whether to refer asylum-seekers to the DOJ under the program, with different sectors operating under different guidelines. In response to the OIG’s 2015 findings, the Border Patrol said it would “develop and implement guidance in all Border Patrol sectors that use Streamline to ensure consistency in all aspects of administrative and criminal processing, particularly with regard to claims of fear of persecution or return.” On Monday, The Intercept asked Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the Border Patrol, about whether the agency had followed up on that commitment and current guidance on referrals to the DOJ. CBP did not provide an answer by publication.</p>

<p>Leading migration scholars tend to agree that so-called push and pull factors, such as the 2008 economic crash or rising violence directed at Central American women and kids, have a much closer link to rising or falling migration levels. A 2015 survey published in the Journal on Migration and Human Security, based on a random sample survey of 1,100 recently deported migrants in six Mexican cities, found that so-called consequence delivery systems such as Operation Streamline “do not have a strong deterrent effect” on illegal border crossing. “Instead,” the report said, “immigration enforcement has led to a ‘caging effect’ over the past two decades which has disrupted seasonal migration flows, increased familial and social ties to the United States, and decreased the probability of returning to Mexico once in the United States.”</p>

<p>Half of the participants in the survey had a U.S. citizen family member, and roughly 1 in 5 had a U.S. citizen child. More than half — 55 percent — said that even after experiencing enforcement firsthand, they intended to return to the U.S. In a report published last week, the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit research and policy organization, took an updated look at Streamline’s relationship to deterrence. Teaming up with researchers at the University of New Haven, Vera performed a statistical analysis of Customs and Border Protection data going back to 1992 designed to isolate “the effects of an intervention” — in this case, Operation Streamline — “from other short- and long-term variations in the data.” The analysis found that “contrary to DHS’s premise, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that Operation Streamline succeeded in deterring unauthorized border crossings, nor that it had any effect whatsoever on immigrants’ decisions to come to the United States.”</p>

<p>Vera’s report found that despite having no demonstrable impact on migration levels, “Operation Streamline had massive effects on immigrants and the federal judicial system.” In the last decade, Streamline has contributed to a flood of cases “reaching a high in 2013 of 47 percent of all federal cases completed,” Vera noted. Those prosecutions require resources that have to be pulled away from other cases that come before federal courts. Streamline’s impact on due process has been similarly severe. “In particularly busy courts, a single attorney might meet with up to 80 Streamline clients per day for only a few minutes each,” the report said. “These limitations placed significant constraints on the ability of attorneys to effectively represent their clients. In the yearlong period ending September 30, 2016, for example, 16,577 defendants in federal district court were charged with unauthorized re-entry; 98 percent were convicted upon entering a guilty plea.”</p>

<p>Given Streamline’s long record of gumming up the courts, and its lack of demonstrable impact on actual migration, it’s reasonable to ask why administrations would continue to run such hard-line programs. In answering this question, Vera points to the “political theater” that followed the September 11 attacks and “measures that provided the illusion of security while doing nothing to actually increase or ensure security.”</p>

<p>“Similarly, Operation Streamline’s lack of any demonstrable deterrent effect arguably makes it ‘deterrence theater,’” the report said. “The mass criminal prosecution and incarceration of immigrants provides the illusion of reducing unauthorized immigration, but statistical analysis provides no evidence of any deterrent effect.”</p>

<p>Tearing kids from their parents, of course, turns some people off, politically. The Trump administration has experienced some of that backlash in recent weeks. But the president also has his supporters: Americans who believe that these parents having their babies and toddlers taken from them, with no word of when they will be reunited, are facing rational and reasonable consequences for their actions, even if they came to the U.S. seeking asylum, which is not against the law. In those corners, this is all long overdue.</p>

<p>With midterm elections approaching and a hungry anti-immigrant base to feed, there’s little sign that the Trump government will willingly pull back on this crackdown. Last month, Stephen Miller, a senior White House adviser, former Sessions aide, and anti-immigrant hawk, signaled to the right-wing website Breitbart that in the next few months, the administration will approach a reduction in unauthorized immigration levels at the border as a “vital necessity.” Six days after Miller’s interview, Sessions sent a letter to all Department of Justice immigration court staff directing them to make themselves available for three two-week postings to border courts between July and the beginning of next year. They were told to expect work involving “mass migration emergencies,” “enforcement initiatives,” and responses to staffing shortages.</p>

<p>While it may score political points with some, Gelernt, the ACLU attorney, believes that the administration may have overplayed its hand with this one. “It doesn’t feel like the administration was prepared for this sort of blowback,” he said. As for the asylum-seekers, he added, they will keep coming. “All you’re doing is just giving them two evils,” Gelernt said. “A mother is not going to stay behind and let a gang kill her and certainly not her kid. And so they’re going to come no matter what. And if the horror of family separation happens, they’re going to be saying, ‘Well, I didn’t really have a choice.’”</p>

<h2 id="howberniesandersevolvedoncriminaljusticereform">How Bernie Sanders Evolved on Criminal Justice Reform</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Shaun King</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-13</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/14/bernie-sanders-criminal-justice-reform/ </p>

<p>Many years ago, an editor gave me some sage but surprising advice. He told me not to meet face-to-face with politicians. He said although I was a fierce critic, the moment I met most of them, everything would change. Up close, politicians can be captivating and charismatic, and after having a personal encounter with them, it would be harder to criticize them.</p>

<p>For pretty much my entire career as a journalist, I’ve stayed true to this counsel, going to outrageous lengths to avoid meeting politicians face-to-face. I’ve never met New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. I’ve never met New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. And I felt fully at peace when I criticized them both for failing to deliver essential criminal justice reforms they promised.</p>

<p>Despite my personal endorsement of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary and campaigning for him, I’ve never met him. I’ve had several opportunities to do so and have found ways to wiggle out of each of the encounters. Consequently, when I’ve felt the need to publicly criticize him for a political blind spot or mistake, I haven’t felt like I was violating a personal relationship.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, I broke my own rule.</p>

<p>As you may know, I help lead a political organization called Real Justice PAC that is fighting to elect reform-minded district attorneys across the country. We recently co-hosted a huge event in Los Angeles with Sanders and the Los Angeles chapter of Black Lives Matter to promote local justice reforms. (My work for Real Justice PAC is independent from The Intercept.)</p>

<p>Sanders’s office reached out to me months ago to begin a dialogue about how he could better support our work. He had read my piece on The Intercept about the radical changes newly elected Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner was making, and it truly seemed to be a revelatory moment for the senator. Within weeks of reading my piece, Sanders was planning on co-hosting an event in Philadelphia with Krasner. Meeting Krasner, I believe, was a transformative moment for Sanders.</p>

<p>In many ways, Krasner is Sanders in district attorney form. Beyond the fact that they are both plain-spoken, gray-haired, bespectacled white men, neither comes from the political establishment. They both see themselves as countercultural leaders determined to challenge the status quo — even if it pisses off every single person around them. Depending on where you are on the political spectrum, you either love them or hate them. Their views, though, are clear. You know where they stand.</p>

<p>In meeting Krasner, Sanders found someone who approaches problems in a manner very similar to his own — but is actually getting stuff done. I don’t mean that as a slight to Sanders, but as a progressive U.S. senator in a Republican-controlled Congress with Donald Trump as president, it’s almost impossible to pass progressive reforms. Krasner has only been in office for six months and is radically changing everything about the inner processes of justice in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It was a light bulb moment. Real Justice helped elect Krasner, as well as other reform candidates across the country, and Sanders now wanted to know how he could help. His team let me know that between a rally he was hosting to bring attention to low wages of Disneyland employees and an event he had in Los Angeles later that evening, Sanders had a narrow window of time to talk about local justice reforms. He would do whatever we asked, the staff told me, meet with whoever we asked, and speak forcefully for essential local and national criminal justice reforms.</p>

<p>This was a risk for Sanders.</p>

<p>In July 2015, Black Lives Matter activists bravely interrupted a town hall with Sanders at a liberal political event, demanding that he center structural racism in his message. The following month, Black Lives Matter activists in Seattle again interrupted a speech from Sanders — demanding that he center the struggle for black lives in his campaign. In both instances, much of Sanders’s white liberal base struggled to understand why such interruptions were necessary.</p>

<p>A few weeks later, in the wake of those two moments, Sanders met privately with another group of black activists to discuss criminal justice reforms. I spoke directly with many of the attendees that day, including DeRay Mckesson, and was told that the meeting didn’t go well – that attendees sensed very little emotional connection from Sanders and that some wondered if he truly even wanted to be there.</p>

<p>So, three years later, to be willing to co-host a public event in front of over 4,000 people, alongside six radical women of color, without ever asking what they would be talking about or knowing if they would plan on calling him out publicly yet again, was a pretty big deal.</p>

<p>Backstage, I met privately with Sanders, and was immediately struck by his vastly improved mastery of core issues around criminal justice reform. But it wasn’t just his newfound fluency on these issues that surprised me — it was his emotion.</p>

<p>“It’s disgusting, Shaun, that our country is basically criminalizing poverty. I’ll be honest with you. I really didn’t know this was happening. I had no idea hundreds of thousands of Americans, particularly African-Americans, were being held in jail, for months or years, even though they’ve never been convicted of a crime, simply because they can’t afford bail,” Sanders told me in a tiny dressing room backstage before the event.</p>

<p>“I’ve learned a lot,” he continued. “I see the racial disparities clearer than ever. I want to help – just tell me how I can best help and we’ll do it.” I was touched. He wasn’t reading from a script. He was admitting to me, as he soon would from the stage, in front of thousands of people, that he hasn’t always gotten this quite right.</p>

<p>Moments later, Sanders met with Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter and a brilliant organizer around justice reform in Los Angeles. When she told him that the city was planning on spending $2.5 billion on constructing a new jail, Sanders was instantly appalled. “What a waste. Imagine if that was spent on education and job training,” he quipped.</p>

<p>Cullors then welcomed to the room the most amazing, fierce, experienced group of activists in Los Angeles – all black and Latina women – who immediately communicated to Sanders how essential it was to have him firmly speak out against the construction of the jail and the horrible use of cash bail as a tool of oppression throughout the city. When Sanders asked about the impact of cash bail on families in Los Angeles, organizer Ivette Ale immediately interjected, “Not only are people losing their jobs because they can’t afford the bail for a crime they haven’t even been convicted of, they are often losing their homes, and even their children. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. If a single mom is arrested — she could be completely innocent — but if she can’t afford bail, her kids are going to be home on their own and sometimes become wards of the state.”</p>

<p>Sanders was clearly listening to Cullors and Ale. In his speech just a few moments later, he skillfully integrated their very thoughts on the outrageous cost of the proposed jail and the horrible consequences of cash bail right into his message.</p>

<p>Sanders is primarily known for speaking about how unfair and unequal the nation’s economy is, but his critics have frequently said that he has communicated this message at the expense of race and racism in America. I’d tend to agree with them and have said so publicly. This was not the case at our event in Los Angeles. Backstage and before the audience, Sanders openly identified race and bigotry as essential primary factors in why two very different justice systems exist in this country.</p>

<p>He clearly and definitively spoke on how essential it was to hold the worst cops in our country accountable for their abuse and brutality. He railed at how outrageous it is for Wall Street bankers who’ve stolen millions of dollars to never spend a day in jail, while black children across the country are sent to prison for stealing a pair of shoes or possessing weed.</p>

<p>Sanders’s speech was good. It wasn’t perfect, but it was really, really good. When Sanders communicated to the crowd how hard the jobs of cops are, and how essential their role is in keeping communities safe, I winced. I was standing next to Melina Abdullah, the director of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, and heard her sigh as well. I assured her that I would communicate to Sanders why such a point probably made perfect sense to him, but stung the crowd.</p>

<p>In our communities, police are often agents of brutality and oppression. Instead of keeping us safe, they arrest and punish people at will. In New York, after the city did away with the policy of stop and frisk and pledged to do away with arresting people for marijuana possession — policies that had seen countless people locked up for doing little or nothing wrong — it would seem like fewer police would now be needed. But police are still an ever-present occupying force. In some communities, police may be seen as welcome guests during emergencies. But in parts of Los Angeles and in many other communities of color across the country, that just isn’t the case.</p>

<p>What Sanders showed in that comment was a man who is still very much evolving. His speech was one of the best I’ve ever heard on criminal justice reform from a mainstream American politician. I wouldn’t give it an A, but I would give it a solid B+. Most politicians don’t even have the courage to show up. Sanders did — and he did so with a very graceful humility.</p>

<p>As he had backstage, Sanders told the audience that he had to admit he was just now catching up with everybody else who had spoken before him about justice reform. Knowing that many in the crowd were there to see him, he told them that the organizers and activists sharing the stage with him were the real heroes.</p>

<p>There was something else I suspected about Sanders that I’d wanted to confirm during our event — and I did manage to confirm it: Sanders had been deeply moved by the death of Erica Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, who was choked to death by a New York police officer 4 years ago. Erica, who was my friend and perhaps my fiercest defender in the country, had been forced into activism and advocacy. Our last conversation before she passed away happened to be about Sanders. She loved him — and she was stingy with who she loved and supported. So many politicians had lied to her about what they’d do and how’d they’d help her family get justice that she had grown sour on pretty much everyone — except Sanders. He had welcomed her on the campaign trail and even co-hosted events with her. I thought her campaign ad about why she supported him was the best of the whole policial season. Having spent time with her, Sanders saw how badly she wanted justice for her family.</p>

<p>In some ways, I think Sanders feels obligated to carry Erica Garner’s baton on criminal justice reform. She gave so much of her energy campaigning for Sanders that he seems to see his fight for justice as a real way of paying her back.</p>

<p>I think he’s made a good start.</p>

<p>So I violated my basic rule of not engaging politicians face-to-face, but in this case, I’m glad I did. I saw the sincerity and growth in a man that I’ve heard others say was too stubborn to change. With those sorts of changes, with people like Sanders taking up the mantle of criminal justice reform, hopefully our struggle can grow so that this country can change, too.</p>

<h2 id="nypddisputesgangdatabasenumbersbutitsmathdoesntaddup">NYPD Disputes Gang Database Numbers — but Its Math Doesn’t Add Up</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Nick Pinto</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-14</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/14/nypd-gang-database-city-council-dermot-shea/ </p>

<p>Senior New York Police Department officials testifying on Wednesday before City Council hotly contested the claim, published first in The Intercept, that the gang database maintained by the department swelled by 70 percent between December 2013 and February 2018 to include more than 42,000 New Yorkers.</p>

<p>“I’ve learned not to believe what I read in the papers. I have no comment on The Intercept,” said Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea. “I did not read the entire [article], but what I did read, I read some glaring errors.”</p>

<p>The Intercept sent the NYPD detailed questions about the gang database before publication. But neither the department nor the mayor’s office responded. Instead, in an op-ed in the New York Daily News on Tuesday, Shea defended the department’s program, arguing that what the headline described as keeping up a “roster of goons” helped keep the city safe.</p>

<p>At the New York City Council hearing, Shea didn’t specify what errors he found in The Intercept’s story, but the gist of his critique was clear: In Shea’s telling, far from ballooning the secret list of suspected gang members, New York police have actually made great strides in reducing the size of what he called the “Criminal Group Database.”</p>

<p>“Around 2014, senior leadership in the NYPD performed a top-to-bottom review of the entire department,” Shea said, “including a review of the department’s Criminal Group Database. At that time, over 34,000 people were entered, without protocols for removal.” As a result of that overhaul, Shea said, the department replaced the old database with a new one and created mechanisms by which people could be removed from the list. “Today,” he said, “our Criminal Group Database has approximately 17,500 individuals, almost half of where it stood in 2014.”</p>

<p>“If there are discrepancies or inaccuracies in those numbers, those are the ones NYPD sent directly to me.”</p>

<p>Shea’s math was difficult to follow and at several points in his testimony appeared to contradict itself. Later in the hearing, touting newly instituted review mechanisms to prune the list of people no longer involved in gangs, he told City Council members that 3,737 people had been removed from the list in the previous four years — well short of the 16,500-person drop he’d suggested earlier.</p>

<p>The Intercept’s reporting was based on the NYPD’s own numbers, as reported to Babe Howell, a gang-policing expert at the City University of New York Law School. In her own testimony to City Council yesterday, Howell noted that her figures were based on the NYPD’s own responses, largely in the form of Freedom of Information disclosures, one of which the department did not fulfill until she sued them. “If there are discrepancies or inaccuracies in those numbers, those are the ones NYPD sent directly to me,” Howell said.</p>

<p>Shea suggested that concern that the database was serving to criminalize young children was misplaced. He testified about the ages of those in the database: Seventeen people entered into the database are 13 years old; 80 people are age 14; 204 are 15; 455 are 16; and 704 are 17. “I won’t add those up,” Shea told council members, “but what I will tell you is individuals in that database that comprise the roughly 17,500, when you look at the totality of under 18 years of age, it’s 2 percent.” The overwhelming majority of people listed in the database are considerably older, Shea said, with the average age being 27.</p>

<p>The Intercept added up Shea’s figures, arriving at a total of more than 8 percent of the NYPD’s purported database numbers composed of individuals under the age of 18.</p>

<p>The NYPD did not respond to an email seeking clarification on Shea’s testimony or his dispute of Howell’s statistics.</p>

<p>The NYPD tracks organized crime wherever it finds it, including Russian, Albanian, and Italian mafias, as well as criminal motorcycle gangs, Shea said. But asked to break down the gang database membership by ethnicity, he testified that it was 65 percent black, 24 percent “white Hispanic,” and 10 percent “black Hispanic.”</p>

<p>This racial disparity is unfortunate, Shea said, but it tracks closely with the realities of violence in New York, where NYPD statistics show that 95 percent of gun violence involves a person of color either as the victim or as a person arrested in the shooting.</p>

<p>Shea stressed that the database was a critical informational tool for police and said inclusion in the NYPD’s gang database doesn’t carry the same negative consequences that might come in other jurisdictions — New York doesn’t have California’s statutory sentencing enhancements for gang members, and “no one outside the NYPD, to my knowledge, has access to the database.”</p>

<p>Pressed by Council Member Rory Lancman, Shea conceded that the NYPD does share gang-status information with prosecutors. “Will we at times discuss that this person is, in fact, a gang member?” he said. “Yes, we will.”</p>

<p>Lancman went on to ask if the NYPD has any guidelines that govern when the department shares a defendant’s inclusion in the gang list. Shea responded, “The answer is no. Every case is unique.”</p>

<p>The hearing had initially been scheduled for a small committee room, but was only moved to the larger chambers after activists complained that the NYPD had packed the room with interns, leaving only a dozen or so seats for press and community members. The police brass left after their own testimony — and with it much of the press — but the City Council committee hearing continued, with lawyers, advocates, academics, and community members sharing their own, overwhelmingly critical, appraisals of the gang database. By the time the last of the advocates testified, only Committee on Public Safety Chair Donovan Richards was left at the dais.</p>

<p>“Those same individuals once subjected to the degradation of multiple stops and frisks are now instead stigmatized as dangerous gang members.”</p>

<p>Marne Lenox, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, told council members that there was a straight line from the racist and unconstitutional pattern of stop and frisk that targeted black and brown New Yorkers over the previous two decades to the “precision policing” of the gang database today.</p>

<p>“The NYPD gang policies and practices appear to be a targeted extension of the unconstitutional racialized policing tactics challenged in” the federal lawsuits that took on the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk policies, Lenox said. “Today, the NYPD notes that police stops are at an all-time low. But while the NYPD cites declining numbers of stops as evidence of its compliance with the law, the department continues to secretly target, surveil, and catalog young men of color. Those same individuals once subjected to the degradation of multiple stops and frisks are now instead stigmatized as dangerous gang members.”</p>

<p>Victor Dempsey told a crowd outside New York City Hall that his gang designation was full of errors, and that it still haunts him in his interactions with police.</p>

<p>Victor Dempsey, a 32-year-old community organizer, told council members that as a young man, he was affiliated with the Bloods. After serving a prison sentence in 2003 for armed robbery, he decided to go straight. Fifteen years later, he was pulled over by police in the Brooklyn neighborhood of East New York last fall and found himself handcuffed in the back of a cruiser. The officer running his license found him still listed in the gang database — as a Crip.</p>

<p>Taylonn Murphy Sr., whose daughter was killed in neighborhood violence and whose son was sentenced to 50 years in prison after a 2014 “gang takedown” raid that netted 103 people in neighboring public housing projects in Harlem, testified that the NYPD’s aggressive, carceral approach hurts poor communities at least as much as the violence it is supposed to reduce. “How do you put out a fire with fire?” Murphy asked.</p>

<p>Throughout the hearing, a squad of officers from the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, a special operations unit created in 2015 to respond to terrorist attacks, civil disorder, and large crowds, stood in the back of the council chamber and outside the chamber door.</p>

<h2 id="themisogynisticlogicofjeffsessionsshorrifyingnewasylumpolicyfordomesticviolencevictims">The Misogynistic Logic of Jeff Sessions’s Horrifying New Asylum Policy For Domestic Violence Victims</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Natasha Lennard</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-15</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/15/domestic-violence-asylum-jeff-sessions/ </p>

<p>When the United Nations adopted the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women in 1993, it gave long overdue recognition to the fact that gendered domestic violence is not a private issue, but a public health and human rights concern for the international community. Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s decision this week to stop giving asylum protections for domestic violence victims stands in grim conflict with this principle.</p>

<p>On Monday, Sessions reversed an immigration court’s ruling that granted asylum to a woman from El Salvador whose husband had repeatedly abused her physically, sexually, and emotionally. The court ruled in 2014 that domestic violence victims constitute a social group when it comes to asylum considerations. But in a 31-page ruling with profound implications for immigration policy, Sessions wrote that “generally” claims on domestic and gang violence will no longer qualify for asylum and will not even reach the initial “credible fear” standard to allow an immigrant to have her asylum claim heard by a judge. Victims of domestic and gang violence, in other words, won’t even be able to have their claims for asylum heard.</p>

<p>The effect of Sessions’s ruling could be sweeping and immediate. Immigration attorneys have said this decision could invalidate tens of thousands of pending asylum claims from women fleeing domestic and gang violence, which often intersect, in Central America and Mexico.</p>

<p>Sessions reasoned that, as victims of “private criminal activity” perpetrated by nongovernmental actors, these asylum seekers fail to meet the legal standard to be considered asylees. Yet in conjuring the legal category of “private” crime — which has no legal meaning — Sessions and his Justice Department rejected the idea that epidemic levels of domestic violence put women in the societal position of a persecuted group. It is the very sort of logic — framing gendered violence as a private, rather than a systematic, human rights issue — that has enabled centuries of domestic abuse without any accountability.</p>

<p>“His claim that this is a ‘private crime’ is a return to a misogynist framework that assesses women as property.”</p>

<p>“His claim that this is a ‘private crime’ is a return to a misogynist framework that assesses women as property,” Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, executive director of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund, a human and civil rights legal organization, told me. She said that under Sessions’s determinations, “Crimes against women as chattel by the masters of a household or relationship thus are not human rights violations, but just ‘personal circumstances.’”</p>

<p>“There is no special status for ‘private crime,’” Verheyden-Hilliard stressed.</p>

<p>The attorney general has been floating plans to reverse asylum case law’s treatment of domestic violence for some time. In an October speech to immigration judges in which Sessions expressed suspicions about asylum claims based on domestic violence, he said asylum should be reserved for those persecuted “based on fundamental things like their religion or nationality.” It was an obvious precursor to his intervention this week, with which he made clear that the systematic treatment of women as second-class citizens, who can be raped and disposed of, is not a “fundamental thing.”</p>

<p>Under the guidelines interpreting the U.N.’s 1951 Refugee Convention, persecution and crimes against women that occur because of their gender, such as rape, are criteria for which women and their children can claim asylum. The U.S. is not a party to the convention, but is party to its protocol. Yet gendered violence has only been included in U.S. case law in recent years.</p>

<p>While domestic and gang violence victims are not explicitly named in the accepted legal definition of “asylee,” the current definition is not as narrow as Sessions presents it as being. The law includes persons persecuted “on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion by a government actor and/or a non-governmental actor that the government is unwilling or unable to control.” The immigration court’s 2014 decision to include certain domestic violence victims as a “particular social group” whose persecutors “the government is unwilling or unable to control” was an extension of the “social group” category.</p>

<p>The situation for certain women in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras is perilous by virtue of their position as women living in poverty and around gang violence.</p>

<p>There should be little doubt that the situation for certain women in the “Northern Triangle” nations — El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras — is perilous by virtue of their position as women living in poverty and around gang violence. A 2016 report from a U.N. special rapporteur on violence against women in El Salvador found that “impunity for crimes, socio-economic disparities and the machista [machismo] culture continue to foster a generalized state of violence, subjecting women to a continuum of multiple violent acts.” Amnesty International reported in 2014 that in El Salvador, “high rates of violence, low reporting, and impunity” enable prolific violence against women. The situation, echoed in Guatemala and Honduras, has driven women to flee in increasing numbers.</p>

<p>There are no statistics detailing how many pending asylum claims relate to domestic or sexual violence, but women from Central America have been successful in gaining asylum on these grounds since the 2014 ruling. According to the Department of Homeland Security, before 2011, over 90 percent of migrants who asked for refuge were “single adult males.” Currently, around 40 percent are “families and children.” An analysis from Reuters said, “at least 230,000 of the 711,000 cases before U.S. immigration courts involve asylum petitions from Central America and Mexico.”</p>

<p>While President Donald Trump uses racist tropes to casts all immigrants from Central America as gangbanger rapists, it is well established that gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha (also called MS-13) and Barrio 18 (also called M-18) use rape as a tactic to establish power and terrorize local populations in their home countries. Were the racism and misogyny not so blatant, there would be a discomforting irony in Trump’s citing of rapists and gang members to bolster a “zero tolerance” immigration approach that does more to hurt rape victims than their rapists and abusers.</p>

<p>The problem is not only with Sessions’s cruel interpretation of the category of “asylee” under U.S. law. His ability to make this ruling speaks in part to the outdated asylum definitions undergirding American immigration law. As New York-based immigration attorney Michael Wildes told me, the “special group” category in which domestic violence victims have been included “was intended to include individuals who are recognized as a visible and ostracized group in a given society. A good example would be LGBTQ individuals in the former Soviet countries.”</p>

<p>Unlike a number of immigration advocates, Wildes agreed with Sessions’s ruling that current asylum law does not support an expansion of the “social group” category to include domestic violence victims. But he noted that this omission highlights the need to expand our current definition of asylum. “Our asylum law is stuck in the Cold War,” he said. “We don’t have as many communist dissidents fleeing to our shores and filing for asylum. We do have people from Latin America who credibly fear for their lives due to gang violence, but who do not fit into our antiquated asylum categories.”</p>

<p>With an administration keen to use these legal definitions in their most restrictive sense, the idea of category expansion seems a distant goal. The best hope now is that immigration advocates, attorneys, and judges take up other cases that will challenge Sessions’s decision and reject the framing of systematic, gender, and sexual violence as a “private” misfortune.</p>

<h2 id="ifaprosecutorbreaksthelawinsecretdoesthecrimeexistnotaccordingtotexasprosecutors">If a Prosecutor Breaks the Law in Secret, Does the Crime Exist? Not According to Texas Prosecutors.</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Jordan Smith</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-14</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/15/prosecutors-misconduct-criminal-justice-reform-texas/ </p>

<p>Shannon Edmonds and Stacey Soule looked confident sitting before a panel of lawmakers in the Texas Capitol late last month. Soule is the state’s prosecuting attorney, whose office litigates cases before the state’s highest criminal court, the Court of Criminal Appeals. Edmonds is a staff attorney and the government relations expert for the powerful Texas District and County Attorneys Association. As such, he’s used to lawmakers heeding his counsel; criminal justice reform is nearly impossible without the support of his association.</p>

<p>The pair was sitting before the House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee for a hearing regarding prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of defense counsel. Soule was there with what sounded like good news. She told the committee that while cases involving prosecutorial misconduct have “dominated discussions about the integrity of our criminal justice system in recent years,” she was “pleased to report that those cases have become less prevalent.” She’d done the research and found that over the last 12 months, the Court of Criminal Appeals had only granted relief four times based on a claim that prosecutors had committed misconduct by withholding evidence.</p>

<p>When it was his turn to speak, Edmonds applauded Soule’s findings. “Having information like this is great,” he told the committee, in part because when it comes to prosecutorial misconduct (and ineffective assistance), there is often “more heat than light.” A lot of people “bang the tables about these problems and claim they are epidemic. And those claims don’t always hold up to scrutiny.” If you search online for “prosecutorial misconduct,” he said, you’ll find a lot of complaints and “supposed data that is rarely independently scrutinized” the way Soule had done.</p>

<p>Of course, looking at the few cases where the notoriously rigid Court of Criminal Appeals has granted relief to a defendant on a claim of prosecutorial misconduct doesn’t seem like the best metric for determining that misconduct’s prevalence. Just days before the hearing, a district court judge in Fort Worth had issued a scathing opinion in the death penalty case against a man named Paul Storey, who was sentenced to die for a 2006 murder at a putt-putt golf course. At his trial, prosecutors told the jury that the victim’s parents, Glenn and Judy Cherry, believed the death penalty was an appropriate punishment for the murder of their son, Jonas. But that wasn’t true. In fact, the Cherrys were adamantly against the death penalty, which they had communicated to prosecutors.</p>

<p>When recently questioned under oath about their actions in the case, the prosecutors said they did nothing wrong — claiming that they told Storey’s defense attorney about the Cherrys’ opposition and then later that Glenn Cherry had changed his mind during the trial and did want Storey to get death. The judge has recommended that Storey be resentenced to life in prison. It will be up to the Court of Criminal Appeals to decide whether that ruling will stand, and although the court is generally supposed to honor the trial judge’s findings, it’s not a given that it will.</p>

<p>Prosecutorial misconduct often takes years — and a fair amount of luck — to unearth. (In Storey’s case, it took nearly a decade.) Since that’s the case, it hardly seems fair to use only cases in which a court has granted relief as a measure of the extent of misconduct.</p>

<p>Daniel Medwed, a professor at Northeastern University’s law school, says that looking at court opinions to measure prosecutorial misconduct can get you only so far. Saying that you can determine the level of misconduct through appellate court decisions presupposes two things: “first, that the misconduct has come to light; and second, that someone has taken the initiative to raise it as an issue,” he said. “And both of those are big hurdles.”</p>

<p>For starters, one of the best understood forms of misconduct, where exculpatory evidence is withheld — known as a Brady violation, after the landmark court case Brady v. Maryland — by definition means that the information was hidden. Trying to ferret it out can take not only years, Medwed says, but also a decent amount of “fluke and happenstance.” And even where the conduct is more obvious — in addition to Brady violations, things like inappropriate closing arguments (such as in the Storey case), the over-coaching of witnesses, or suborning perjury are considered misconduct — whether the courts will sanction the action is hardly certain. That is because of so-called harmless error analysis, in which a judge may conclude there was misconduct, but that relief from the conviction or sentence isn’t warranted because the misconduct didn’t impact the outcome of the case. “No harm, no foul kind of thing — except it is a foul. But it didn’t cause harm, as far as [the judge] has decided,” he said. “A lot of us would say that’s ridiculous; how could you ever measure the impact of an egregious closing argument?”</p>

<p>Plea bargaining also complicates the ability to understand the pervasiveness of misconduct. Fully 95 percent of criminal cases are resolved by plea, but generally, as part of that process prosecutors are not required to turn over discovery materials to the defense — evidence against the defendant or evidence that may be exculpatory or mitigating — that would help them to evaluate whether the plea offer is fair. And, for the most part, taking a plea means waiving many rights, including to appeal. “So, who knows what misconduct happens there, right?” said Angela Davis, a longtime defense attorney who was director of the venerable D.C. Public Defender Service before becoming a professor of law at American University.</p>

<p>Prosecutors will often overcharge a defendant as a means of pressuring the person into taking a plea — slapping on a slew of charges, some of which they may ultimately never be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. And “a lot of times, it is before the defense attorney even has an opportunity to investigate the case,” she said. “But it looks like a good deal and you have to tell your client about it, but you haven’t had a chance to even get basic discovery — much less discover misconduct.”</p>

<p>Given the circumstances, says Medwed, looking at the number of cases where relief has been granted based on a Brady violation should be considered “just the tip of the iceberg.”</p>

<p>A Snitch in Time</p>

<p>Perhaps no one knows this better than Scott Sanders. A public defender in Orange County, California, Sanders has spent the last five years attempting to unravel a misconduct scandal that has infected both the county district attorney’s office and the county sheriff’s department. The misconduct goes back decades and has impacted an unknowable number of cases. Widely known as the Orange County snitch scandal, prosecutors and sheriff’s deputies for years utilized a secret jail informant program to generate questionable evidence against defendants, often in violation of their constitutional rights. And, as it often happens, it was just a fluke that Sanders was able to uncover what had been going on for years; he happened to be assigned to two separate capital cases and noticed in the discovery materials that each of his clients had allegedly made confessions to the same jailhouse informant. He pulled the thread and was ultimately able to show a district judge that county law enforcers had been engaged in, and hiding, their informant scheme for years. The fallout from Sanders’s discovery is still ongoing — even as the longtime Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has maintained that his prosecutors didn’t intentionally do anything wrong and even managed last week to survive the primary election. Sanders said 18 criminal cases tied to the scandal have been reversed to date, with charges dismissed or reduced, or new trials granted.</p>

<p>And he’s sure the true number of cases impacted by the misconduct is far higher, but the cases are hard to identify — and where they are decades old or involved a plea deal, there is little recourse for defendants. He says because he is employed by a public defender office where lawyers are working together on a daily basis, he has an advantage in his attempts to root out misconduct. But for the most part, defense lawyers who practice alone, whether paid or court-appointed, are siloed from one another, making it harder to compare notes on cases the way Sanders has been able to do. And lawyers who come forward with allegations are putting at risk their ongoing relationships with prosecutors’ offices, he says, and even with judges, many of whom in Orange County and many other jurisdictions are former prosecutors. “In our instance,” he said, “we needed a trillion things to come together to even have that opportunity to learn that this [misconduct] existed.”</p>

<p>Alexandra Natapoff, a professor of law at the University of California, Irvine says if it weren’t for Sanders, it’s likely the public would never know about the rampant misconduct in Orange County. And that, she says, is because the system isn’t designed for transparency. “When I think about this question of why do we not know about prosecutorial misconduct, and we don’t, why do we not know about [the extent of] wrongful convictions, and we don’t, why do we not know about the routine systemic failures that occur in cases every day that players within the system get to view, but are very hard to view from the outside — it is because the system is not designed to be externally accountable,” she said. “It is designed to be adversarial and our adversarial system is flawed.”</p>

<p>What little public accountability exists is borne on the back of defendants who actually exercise their right to trial. “When a defendant goes to trial, that is the moment we learn the most about how our criminal system works,” she said. “When the defendant demands information, then the public gets to learn about it; when the defendant challenges prosecutorial misconduct, then the public learns about it.” But the plea process cuts off that access, and as a defendant cedes his right to information, “the public also loses access to that information and accountability.”</p>

<p>Part of the movement of reforming the criminal justice system is about rethinking the trust we put into its institutions — police, prosecutors, courts, and judges. “For a long time, we’ve gone on the assumption that they’re doing their jobs and acting in the public interest, and we’ve created rules of deference and secrecy in order to protect their ability to do that,” she said. “As soon as you have concerns about the ways that they’re doing their jobs, deference and secrecy are no longer good policies. And I think that what we’re seeing throughout the criminal system is a new sense that there needs to be more accountability, that there needs to be more transparency … because we understand that the system requires that for fair, accurate, and transparent functioning and that the old model of deference to these institutions is no longer a workable one.”</p>

<p>Davis is of a similar mindset. After decades of thinking and writing about prosecutors, she says the answer lies in electing progressive candidates who are committed to “fundamentally different values and views and visions of the criminal justice system.” She says we need more prosecutors like Larry Krasner in Philadelphia who, among other things, is now compiling a comprehensive list of police officers whose court testimony may be questionable, information he will have his prosecutors turn over to defense attorneys. And prosecutors like Kim Foxx in Chicago, who has promised bail reform and ending the practice of overcharging, among other changes. “You need people who actually have the will to be fair,” she said. “I think that takes new vision.”</p>

<h2 id="federalcounteringviolentextremismgrantsfocusonminoritycommunitiesincludinginschools">Federal “Countering Violent Extremism” Grants Focus on Minority Communities — Including in Schools</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Murtaza Hussain</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-15</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/15/cve-grants-muslim-surveillance-brennan-center/ </p>

<p>The United States government offers millions of dollars in grants for local and state government agencies with the stated purpose of rooting out potential terrorists, but the people receiving those grants have particular targets in mind: minorities. These minority communities, particularly Muslims, are the focus of the anti-terror grants despite surging white supremacist political violence. Some 85 percent of the grants — which are offered by the federal government under the controversial rubric of Countering Violent Extremism, or CVE, programs — target Muslims and other minority groups, according to a new study issued by the Brennan Center for Justice, a public policy and law institute.</p>

<p>“This programming is based on the idea that some communities — particularly Muslims, immigrants, and refugees — are more prone to ideological violence,” said Faiza Patel, the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center and a co-author of the report. “But we’ve never seen attempts to ‘build resiliency’ among white communities following acts of violence by white Americans.”</p>

<p>“This programming is based on the idea that some communities — particularly Muslims, immigrants, and refugees — are more prone to ideological violence.”</p>

<p>Implicit in the Brennan Center’s findings, which looked at some two dozen grant applications obtained through public records requests, was the characterization of increased local diversity as a potential national security risk. Many of the CVE applications echoed some of the toxic rhetoric of President Donald Trump’s administration — a sign that anti-Muslim sentiment and bigotry at the top of the federal government was trickling down into local policy.</p>

<p>“One of things that is striking about these grants programs is that they are being implemented under an administration that is overtly hostile to diversity and wants to return to a time of a more ethnically homogenous America,” she said. “If that’s your model for the country, you will obviously be prone to view diversity itself as a threat.”</p>

<p>CVE programs are ostensibly aimed at staunching the sort of “radicalization” that could lead to terrorist attacks, but in practice they have been widely panned by members of the communities the programs target. Criticisms of the program often state that the initiatives funded by CVE grants are ineffective and target these communities for unjust surveillance.</p>

<p>The Brennan Center report looks at approved grants from a number of local police departments across the country, as well as community groups and local government offices. Among the approved grants include programs intended to teach law enforcement agents and local community partners how to recognize violent extremist behaviors and indicators, as well as “terrorism ideologies” and the “root causes of extremism.”</p>

<p>While the report noted that actually determining who will receive the CVE funding earmarked in the applications is difficult because many of the named recipients operate their programs through “pass-through organizations” that effectively act as subcontractors for the programs, an array of local government agencies applied for the funding.</p>

<p>Among the organizations listed as recipients of CVE grants are the Houston mayor’s office; Minnesota’s Hennepin County Sheriff, whose jurisdiction includes Minneapolis and its Somali enclaves; the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, which includes Oakland, California; and an array of domestic NGOs engaged in public safety and counter-extremism work. The grant applications typically include activities described as setting up workshops and trainings for “community leaders,” as well as the creation of reporting mechanisms for community members to inform law enforcement about extremist content that they encounter online or in the community. Many of the programs are explicit in their focus on Muslim communities.</p>

<p>“Law enforcement needs to be transparent about why they want to meet with communities,” said Sahar Aziz, a national security expert at Rutgers University Law School. “Community outreach in and of itself is not presumptively nefarious, but a problem arises when the outreach proceeds misleadingly and is actually a cover for law enforcement agencies doing anti-terrorism work. The way that manifests itself is by law enforcement using community outreach events as opportunities to gather intelligence, to identify possible targets for sting operations, or to identify possible informants for recruitment.”</p>

<p>The introduction of CVE programs in the United States has long been a contentious issue for civil liberties groups. The programs are promoted as a softer approach to fighting terrorism. In 2015, the Obama administration held a three-day CVE “summit” at the White House, where it announced its intention to begin rolling out counter-extremism programs in a number of cities across the U.S. In 2016, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Community Partnerships announced $10 million in CVE grants intended to fund programs in the U.S.</p>

<p>By deputizing ordinary people to act as informants against other members of their communities, critics say, the programs can act as tools of unjust surveillance for the government. In the United Kingdom, CVE programs have been blamed for creating a climate of fear among British Muslims, who have been targeted by medical professionals and teachers tasked with rooting out extremist ideologies among those they serve. These programs have led to perverse situations in which staff at children’s nurseries were asked to identify possible extremism among the toddlers under their care. In the U.S., “community outreach” programs have sometimes served as cover for gathering intelligence on immigrant and minority communities. A 2015 report by The Intercept documented how law enforcement-led community outreach programs to Somali communities in Minnesota covertly operated as a channel for conducting surveillance.</p>

<p>“Ultimately, CVE needs to be shut down and communities need to be able to get funds from social service agencies such as Health and Human Services, and use those funds to support problems that they identify on their own and which are disconnected from CVE,” said Aziz, the Rutgers professor, describing CVE as “a politically correct term for counterterrorism.”</p>

<p>“Expanding CVE activities into schools undermines young people’s ability to express themselves in ways protected by the constitution.”</p>

<p>The inclusion of CVE programming targeting schools and young people has been a particular source of concern for civil liberties groups. A 2016 FBI document about the threat of extremism among youth included numerous recommendations for schools to police possible radicalism among their students, including “threat assessment teams,” “annual violent extremism training,” and cooperation with law enforcement in intelligence gathering. The list of approved grants in the Brennan Center report include numerous school-related activities targeted at young people, raising concerns of the securitization of schools and discrimination against minority students. A grant program approved for the Denver Police Department, for example, includes plans for officers to lead a number of CVE-related “mentoring” programs at five local middle and high schools, focused on young people determined to be “at-risk” by teachers, counselors, or other community members.</p>

<p>“Expanding CVE activities into schools undermines young people’s ability to express themselves in ways protected by the constitution, by making hem feel like they will be under government scrutiny for their speech,” said Johnathan Smith, legal director for the civil rights group Muslim Advocates. “Very troubling issues of stereotyping and profiling also arise when you bring these types of programs into school settings. Schools should be places where students feel that they are being supported to [become] fully participating members of society, but these programs encourage teachers and other students to view their peers as inherently suspicious.”</p>

<p>Roughly half of the CVE grants highlighted by the Brennan Center mention protecting civil liberties, but without getting into specifics of how this will be accomplished. The Houston mayor’s office names the Anti-Defamation League as a partner that will assist CVE program administrators in “ensuring civil rights and liberties are protected.” Yet the Anti-Defamation League — a group whose mission is opposing bigotry — has its own history of questionable surveillance of Muslim communities and, more recently, was helmed by Abraham Foxman, who was accused of harboring an anti-Muslim animus and defended blanket spying on American Muslims.</p>

<p>Instead of viewing minority communities as threats and focusing on programs to surveil them, the Brennan Center’s Patel said, the federal government should instead focus on putting resources into these communities for their betterment.</p>

<p>“If the government wants to spend money on helping Muslim communities, they shouldn’t be doing so under the guise of countering extremism or counterterrorism,” said Patel. “They should begin by identifying community concerns, which will likely mirror those of other Americans, from bad schools to lack of opportunity. Addressing those issues would help support the core building blocks of good citizenship, and that’s where this money would be better spent.”</p>

<h2 id="theusisexacerbatingtheworldsworsthumanitariancrisisbyoutsourcingitsyemenpolicy">The U.S. Is Exacerbating the World’s Worst Humanitarian Crisis by Outsourcing Its Yemen Policy</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alex Emmons</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-16</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/16/yemen-foreign-policy-united-states/ </p>

<p>Three years of civil war in Yemen have created the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with the United Nations estimating that 22 million people — three-quarters of the country’s population — urgently need humanitarian aid.</p>

<p>But aid groups have seen their worst fears realized this week, as U.S.-backed forces organized by the United Arab Emirates launched an assault on the rebel-held port of Hodeidah — the entry point for 70 to 80 percent of the food, medicine, and aid supplies entering Yemen.</p>

<p>Oxfam has warned that a prolonged battle or siege would “massively escalate this humanitarian crisis while millions already are on the brink of famine,” and the U.N. has said it would damage the prospects for long-term peace negotiations. Martin Griffiths, the U.N. peace envoy for Yemen, warned the U.N. Security Council that the assault “would, in a single stroke, take peace off the table.”</p>

<p>The Intercept interviewed more than a dozen former White House and State Department officials, humanitarian leaders, and Yemen experts, many of whom characterized the offensive as a major failure by the U.S. to restrain its coalition partners, who are largely dependent on American weapons, intelligence, and logistical support. Those sources said the attack was a sign that the U.S. is allowing allies like Saudi Arabia and the UAE to drive American policy decisions in Yemen.</p>

<p>“The UAE’s assault on Hodeidah is just another example of the Trump administration outsourcing U.S. policy in Yemen — and really the region writ large — to the Gulf states,” said Kate Kizer, policy director at the Washington, D.C.-based advocacy group Win Without War.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia and the UAE began bombing Yemen in March 2015, with the aim of restoring the former Saudi-backed president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi to power. Hadi was deposed after a rebel group commonly known as the Houthis stormed the capital in 2014; he eventually fled the country.</p>

<p>The Obama administration wholeheartedly backed the Saudi- and Emirati-led intervention and blockade, and provided the coalition with intelligence and tens of billions of dollars in weapons. Under Obama, the Pentagon also helped refuel coalition aircraft, continuing even after they bombed civilian targets like schools and hospitals.</p>

<p>But even as Obama administration officials watched a growing humanitarian crisis unfold in Yemen, the White House firmly opposed a coalition attack on Hodeidah. The coalition had long wanted to attack the crucial port; doing so would have aligned with the Emiratis’ broader strategy of seizing ports along Yemen’s southern and Red Sea coasts. In 2015, UAE-backed forces seized the southern port city of Aden. In 2016, they retook the city of Mukalla from Yemen’s Al Qaeda affiliate and later pushed up the Red Sea coast, retaking the port city of Mokha last year.</p>

<p>In a country as dependent on foreign goods as Yemen, ports are extremely lucrative for whoever controls them. Experts have estimated that the Houthis collect tens of millions of dollars a month in customs and import fees on cargo coming in through Hodeidah.</p>

<p>When the Saudis and Emiratis tried to get Obama administration support for an assault on Hodeidah, their arguments were reminiscent of promises they had made in 2015 before launching an attack on Aden, said Jeremy Konyndyk, who served as director of foreign disaster assistance under Obama.</p>

<p>“Then, too, they argued that taking the town would put political pressure on the Houthis and enable the free flow of humanitarian aid through the port,” Konyndyk said. “Three years later, none of those promises have panned out.”</p>

<p>Even if the assault on Hodeidah is a military success, he said, it will be devastating to Yemeni civilians.</p>

<p>“When you place a frontline directly between a port and the population it serves, it effectively cuts off that population,” Konyndyk said. In Aden, those consequences were less extreme because most Yemenis weren’t entirely dependent on it. “But if Hodeidah is cut off, there is no backup option. Food will run out, fuel to support water systems and aid operations will run out, and people will begin dying in large numbers.”</p>

<p>At one point in 2016, when the White House learned that the UAE wanted to move forward with an operation to seize Hodeidah, Susan Rice, Obama’s national security adviser, personally called UAE Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed and told him that the U.S. would not support the offensive, according to three former senior U.S. officials. The UAE backed down.</p>

<p>But the Trump administration has been less forceful in its opposition to the attack. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to various Emirati officials and cautioned against damaging the port infrastructure and hampering the flow of aid through Hodeidah, but did not pressure them to stop the offensive.</p>

<p>“The United States has been clear with Saudi, Emirati, and Yemeni officials at every level that the destruction of critical infrastructure or disruption of the delivery of vital humanitarian aid and commercial goods is unacceptable,” a State Department spokesperson told The Intercept.</p>

<p>But activists and aid groups say that there is no way to attack the city without hampering access to aid, at least for a period of time. Coalition warplanes have already bombed the main road from Hodeidah to the Houthi stronghold of Sanaa in an attempt to keep reinforcements from reaching the port, according to The Guardian.</p>

<p>“Rather than preventing the offensive, which the U.S. has done twice before, Pompeo releases a weak statement giving the UAE the green light to potentially kill hundreds of thousands of people with no political strategy or end goal,” said Kizer of Win Without War.</p>

<p>Pompeo’s statement represents a softening of the State Department’s public position against any offensive that posed a danger to the port. Compare it with what David Satterfield, the acting assistant secretary for the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in April, as Emirati-backed forces gathered ominously in Mokha, which is just south of Hodeidah.</p>

<p>“I’ll be quite explicit,” Satterfield said then. “We have told the Emirates and the Saudis there is to be no action undertaken that could threaten the ports of Hodeidah and Salif, or any routes to and from the port for delivery of assistance.”</p>

<p>When Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., asked how the U.S. would respond if the Saudis or Emiratis were to “bomb the port of Hodeidah,” Satterfield replied: “We would not view such an action as consistent with our own policy, upon which our support is based.”</p>

<p>However, just two days later, at a private, off-the-record roundtable at the Middle East Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., several former Obama administration officials began to worry that a very different message was being conveyed to the Emiratis and Saudis.</p>

<p>At the roundtable, Matthew Tueller, the current U.S. ambassador to Yemen and the State Department’s primary diplomatic liaison with the coalition, was asked what he’d heard about a coming offensive against Hodeidah and its potentially catastrophic impact, according to two people in the room.</p>

<p>According to those present, Tueller said that a direct attack would be a “roll of the dice” that might meet with popular support and expel the Houthis from the city, though whether the chances of success were “50-50” or “10-90,” Tueller couldn’t say. He added that Hodeidah’s importance for aid delivery was overstated, and suggested that an assault on the city would not have the catastrophic effect aid groups claimed, according to the people who were there.</p>

<p>Several who attended the briefing said they were surprised by the contrast between Tueller’s private comments and the State Department’s public statements. “It was an early sign that even the State Department wasn’t taking its own policy seriously,” said one person who was there but asked not to be named because speaking about what was said would violate the terms of the meeting.</p>

<p>“We are not going to comment on alleged statements made at an off-the-record event,” a State Department spokesperson told The Intercept.</p>

<p>Tueller has a history of taking positions that are favorable to the coalition. According to two former Obama administration officials and one current State Department official, Tueller believes that a successful military offensive against the Houthis would improve the prospects for peace talks because it would pressure them to negotiate a settlement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Griffiths, the U.N. envoy, has called on the coalition to “exercise restraint and give peace a chance,” warning that further escalation “will have an impact on my efforts to resume political negotiations to reach an inclusive political settlement to the conflict in Yemen.”</p>

<p>Kizer put it more bluntly: “Believing that this offensive will bring the Houthis to the negotiating table is living in a fantasyland.”</p>

<p>Last month, as Emirati-backed forces moved north along Yemen’s Red Sea coast toward Hodeidah, aid workers began to worry that the State Department was tempering its warnings to avoid directly criticizing its coalition partners.</p>

<p>On May 25, the State Department held a closed-door roundtable discussion between Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator Mark Green, and D.C.-based representatives from humanitarian organizations working in Yemen. The meeting was the fourth such discussion in a series of roundtables since December 2017, and the conversation quickly turned to the Hodeidah offensive.</p>

<p>According to three people in attendance, Sullivan and Green listened keenly to nongovernmental organizations’ warnings against attacking Hodeidah. Humanitarian leaders argued that coalition-controlled ports like Mokha and Aden couldn’t bring in enough aid to compensate for restricted access at Hodeidah. But when the discussion turned to how the State Department would respond to the offensive, “the response was equivocal,” one attendee told The Intercept.</p>

<p>Something had changed. A month after Satterfield publicly testified that “there is to be no action undertaken that could threaten the port,” State Department officials wouldn’t repeat that position in private.</p>

<p>According to CNN, the U.S. has rejected coalition appeals for direct military and intelligence support. However, on Friday, the U.S. voiced opposition to a U.N. Security Council resolution calling on the coalition to stop the assault.</p>

<p>The mixed messages from the U.S. are seen by humanitarian groups as signaling cautious approval for the operation. Earlier this week, one unnamed U.S. official described the message to the Wall Street Journal as a “blinking yellow light” of caution.</p>

<p>“I knew we were in trouble when an anonymous source described it that way,” the director of a U.S.-based humanitarian organization told me. “In Washington, blinking yellow lights mean, ‘Floor it and keep moving.'”</p>

<h2 id="desperateasylumseekersarebeingturnedawaybyusborderagentsclaimingtheresnoroom">Desperate Asylum-Seekers Are Being Turned Away by U.S. Border Agents Claiming There’s “No Room”</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Debbie Nathan</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-16</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/16/immigration-border-asylum-central-america/ </p>

<p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents are systematically violating U.S. and international law by blocking immigrants at international ports of entry on the southern border from entering the country so they can claim asylum. Immigration civil rights advocates have been documenting this illegal behavior since late 2016, from Texas to California. It was sporadic then, and appears to have been based at least in part on CBP’s difficulties with handling large numbers of people.</p>

<p>Even so, the practice of turning immigrants away has suddenly become routine, creating chilling scenes of immigrants and children camped out near the bridges, exposed to sun, wind, and rain, amid make-do bedding, scattered clothing, and trash. A few times a day, the immigrants walk to the middle of the bridges and ask to be admitted to the port of entry building on the U.S. side so that they can request asylum. They are almost always turned back.</p>

<p>The Intercept witnessed such a scene on June 4 in El Paso, Texas. At 6 a.m., the sun rose on a 15-year-old Guatemalan boy and his father who were trying to walk across the border to apply for asylum. They did not swim the Rio Grande or otherwise attempt to enter the country illegally — they’d made their attempt on an arcing, international bridge that joins El Paso with its Mexican sister city, Ciudad Juárez.</p>

<p>An error occurred.</p>

<p>Try watching this video on www.youtube.com, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.</p>

<p>They were stopped at the top of the bridge by two CBP agents who refused to let them cross, pointed them back to Mexico, and said to try crossing later. This was the sixth time in three days that the man, his son, and about a dozen other Guatemalans had been thus rejected.</p>

<p>I knew they were Guatemalans because I’d spoken with the man two days earlier. I spotted him and the group squatting disconsolately on the Mexican side of the bridge by the public bathrooms. This man and others in the group told me then that they were asylum-seekers afraid to go back to their home country because of violence there. They were extremely frustrated about being turned away. They recounted that the agents always told them there was “no room” to process them at the port of entry, and they should come back later when there might be room. There never was room. “False words,” the man with the son said, in Spanish that was heavily accented by Q’eqchi’, his indigenous tongue. Another man started crying.</p>

<p>Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, immigrants within the U.S. who tell immigration officials they’re afraid to return to their countries have the right to request asylum and to be immediately processed. They are not supposed to be turned back at bridges. They are not supposed to be banished to life on Mexican sidewalks, by public toilets, begging passersby for tacos to feed their children.</p>

<p>Yet this has been happening, not just at El Paso but also at ports of entry all along the southern border. Immigration rights advocates first noticed that asylum-seekers were being turned away at some bridges shortly after the election of Donald Trump, and the practice continued into 2017. A Southern California immigrant advocacy group, Al Otro Lado, responded by suing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for violations of U.S. immigration law and the Constitution. The suit is ongoing.</p>

<p>The blocking works this way: In the precise middle of the international bridges, CBP agents stand, sentry-like, near the imaginary line dividing the two countries — a line often marked with a ceremonial metal plaque. The agents peer at everyone crossing, looking for people they think might be candidates for asylum. If the people say anything suggesting they might be requesting asylum — if they’re not Mexicans, and especially if they’re from Central America — the agents block their way and say to come back another time.</p>

<p>Local people who frequently cross the border started noticing the agents in early May, but did not know why they were on the bridge. Some people started calling Ruben Garcia, director of Annunciation House, a migrant shelter which encompasses a network of satellite shelters. The shelters have for years maintained a close relationship with ICE. They regularly take in immigrants who’ve been picked up by the Border Patrol, processed, and released by ICE pending the results of their immigration cases. Garcia says he is very familiar with how many people the government picks up from week to week, and with how much of their own space CBP and ICE have to process people.</p>

<p>In late May, Garcia and some volunteers at his shelters began visiting the bridges and taking statements from Central Americans who’d been denied entry.</p>

<p>Based on that experience and on other information he has gathered, Garcia believes that the sudden day-in, day-out presence of CBP agents on the bridges, and their routine turn-backs of Central Americans and other migrants, is something new and disturbing.</p>

<p>In El Paso, Garcia believes that the government’s claims of “no room” in 2016 and 2017 might have had some merit. “Back then, there really were a lot of Central Americans coming, and I know the government was overwhelmed in El Paso because we were overwhelmed at our shelters,” Garcia said. But now, he said, the situation has changed: “The numbers are down at our shelters. And if they’re down at our shelters, they’ve got to be down at the government’s facilities.” Garcia said those facilities include interview rooms at ports of entry. He can’t imagine they are overtaxed. Yet, he said, Central Americans stranded at the bridge constantly tell him that CBP agents say there’s “no room” to process the migrants.</p>

<p>Garcia said he asked a low-level CBP agent, who was working at an international bridge, why Central Americans were being blocked. “This is a borderwide policy,” Garcia said the agent answered. Garcia believes the policy is connected to Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s “zero tolerance” policy initiated in early May.</p>

<p>That is when the Trump administration began routinely splitting up immigrant adults and children who were caught crossing into the U.S. Most were families from Central America.</p>

<p>By blocking asylum-seekers from crossing legally, CBP is pressuring them to cross illegally. Garcia believes that this new practice gives the government an excuse to split up even more families.</p>

<p>“By putting officers on the bridge,” said a CBP spokesperson, the agency “is taking a proactive approach to ensure that arriving travelers have valid entry documents in order to expedite the processing of lawful travel.”</p>

<p>Depending upon port circumstances at the time of arrival, individuals presenting without documents may need to wait in Mexico as CBP officers work to process those already within our facilities. The number of inadmissible individuals we are able to process in a day varies based on the complexity of the cases, resources available, medical needs, translation requirements, holding/detention space, overall port volume and enforcement actions. As in the past when we’ve had to limit the number of people we can bring in for processing at a given time, we expect that this will be a temporary situation.</p>

<p>Amber Ramirez, a former immigration paralegal, came to the same conclusion earlier this month after she saw social media posts on Facebook about CBP agents blocking asylum-seekers on the international bridge.</p>

<p>Ramirez, 25, crosses frequently between El Paso and Juárez. On her way to El Paso one day after looking at Facebook, Ramirez saw a group of people who looked distressed. Speaking with them, she learned that all were from Guatemala: a 16-year-old girl and a woman with a frightened preschool-aged daughter. The teenager told Ramirez they had been prevented from crossing for days. They said they were considering coming into the U.S. by wading and walking under the bridge.</p>

<p>Ramirez knew that the wading and walking would result in the mother being criminally prosecuted and separated from her child, so she decided to act, even though she felt shaky. “My whole life, I’ve been scared and intimated” by border agents, she said. She gathered the teenager, the woman, and the child. She walked them to the top of the bridge.</p>

<p>Once there, she noticed that one CBP agent was standing north of the border, well within the United States. Ramirez then looked at the Central Americans and realized that they inadvertently had stepped forward. They were in the United States, too.</p>

<p>The agents tried to get Ramirez and the group to take a few steps backward, into Mexico. Instead, the group stayed politely but stubbornly in place. A quiet standoff ensued.</p>

<p>A supervisor arrived and seemed angry. Ramirez tried hard to remember the text of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the part about “aliens” in U.S. territory having the right to claim asylum. She wanted to quote it to the supervisor, but apparently he already knew the law. She remembers him scowling but waving the Central Americans past the blockade and toward the port of entry.</p>

<p>Two days later, on June 4, I saw the Guatemalan man with his 15-year-old son walking south on the bridge to Mexico. The man said they had just been prevented from crossing by CBP blockade for the sixth time in three days. I asked if he and his son would walk back again, with me behind them, filming. He agreed.</p>

<p>At the top, something similar to Ramirez’s experience occurred. When the agents saw us, they noticed that I was taking a video with my phone and seemed flustered. While telling the man and his son that there was “no room,” they stepped backward into the U.S. The Guatemalans stepped forward.</p>

<p>I noted to the agents that the Guatemalans were now in the U.S. and now had the legal right to request asylum. “It’s not that we’re not going to help them — it’s a capacity issue,” one agent said. The two shifted from foot to foot, and one called a supervisor. The Guatemalans stolidly held their ground in their first few inches of America.</p>

<p>The supervisor arrived, assessed the situation, and waved the father and son northward. I followed. The supervisor’s walkie-talkie squawked to officials farther down the line that asylum-seekers were coming to the port of entry along with a reporter.</p>

<p>Suddenly, another Guatemalan father-and-son pair came up behind us. I’d earlier met and filmed them, too. They said they had decided to follow me when they saw I was walking behind the others. This second family had also been denied entry many times. Now, they had also just been let through.</p>

<p>Inside the port, a gray-haired CBP agent peered at the four Guatemalans’ wrinkled identity papers, which the fathers had fished from old plastic bags. In a pleasant voice, the agent asked, “Are you afraid to return to your country?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Guatemalans.</p>

<p>“Step this way.”</p>

<p>I said goodbye and good luck to the Guatemalans.</p>

<p>But without advocates or press at their sides, other immigrants are still not getting past the bridge blockade. On June 9, two journalists — Bob Moore, a freelancer, and Claudia Tristán, of El Paso’s KFOX-TV — stood on the southbound side of the bridge, where they were not immediately visible to the CBP officials. Each pointed their phones toward the northbound side and filmed a woman — whom they later determined was a Honduran asylum-seeker — and her small son walking several feet into the United States. Their videos show the two being turned back to Mexico.</p>

<p>Karolina Walters is a staff attorney at the Washington, D.C.-based American Immigration Council, one of three groups representing plaintiffs in the Al Otro Lado lawsuit. She says these turn-backs of people already on U.S. soil constitute civil rights violations and “get to the heart of the lawsuit.”</p>

<p>The day after the journalists made their turn-back videos, Garcia called a community meeting to recruit volunteers to go to the bridge in shifts. Almost 50 people came to the meeting — a very impressive number for El Paso, Garcia said. Similar gatherings have been underway during the past several days in other Texas border cities.</p>

<p>Garcia is training some of his recruits to go to the bridges in shifts and take notes when they see refugees being turned back from requesting asylum. He has another group that is learning to accompany the immigrants to the invisible line. He hopes those volunteers will be able to help asylum-seekers exercise their rights in the face of blockading border agents.</p>

<h2 id="anthonyrayhintonspentalmost30yearsondeathrownowhehasamessageforwhiteamerica">Anthony Ray Hinton Spent Almost 30 Years on Death Row. Now He Has a Message for White America.</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Liliana Segura</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-16</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/17/anthony-ray-hinton-death-row/ </p>

<p>Anthony Ray Hinton was mowing the lawn at his mother’s house in 1985 when Alabama police came to arrest him for two murders he did not commit. One took place when he was working the night shift at a Birmingham warehouse. Yet the state won a death sentence, based on two bullets it falsely claimed matched a gun found at his mother’s home. In his powerful new memoir, “The Sun Does Shine: How I Found Life and Freedom on Death Row,” Hinton describes how racism and a system stacked against the poor were the driving forces behind his conviction. He also writes about the unique and unexpected bonds that can form on death row, and in particular about his relationship with Henry Hays, a former Klansman sentenced to death for a notorious lynching in 1981. Hays died in the electric chair in 1997 — one of 54 people executed in Alabama while Hinton was on death row.</p>

<p>After almost 30 years, Hinton was finally exonerated in 2015, thanks to the Equal Justice Initiative, or EJI. On April 27, Hinton spoke at the Peace and Justice Summit in Montgomery, organized by EJI to launch two new historical memorials: the Memorial to Peace and Justice and the Legacy Museum. (See related coverage here.) I met Hinton at a conference room at EJI’s headquarters. In a blue checkered shirt and black boots, he said he likes to picture his lawyer and close friend Bryan Stevenson at that same table, strategizing around his case. We discussed Hinton’s memoir, his unlikely friendship with Hays, and the links between racial violence and the modern death penalty.</p>

<p>Liliana Segura: You were a big part of the opening of EJI’s Peace and Justice Summit. What was it like to visit the memorial and museum?</p>

<p>Anthony Ray Hinton: Seeing myself in the museum was like, “Wow.” A whole lot of memories came back — not all good memories. But if 30 years is what it cost me to educate people, so be it. Those names you read when you go up to the memorial — they lost their life. As you read why they were lynched, you think, are you serious? This man was lynched because he asked for a receipt. This man was lynched because he looked at a white woman. Although I’ve read about all of these types of crimes, it brought tears to my eyes.</p>

<p>I call the death penalty, to this day, a form of lynching. It’s not where they run to your house and burn you up without justification. Now, they do it in the name of the law. I was a victim of that, and almost lost my life because they have that much power.</p>

<p>LS: Lynching was a form of torture and terror for the community. You write vividly about those nights when men were killed in the electric chair. Would you call that torture?</p>

<p>ARH: Absolutely. It’s torture for the guards that have a job to do. It’s torture for the warden. It was torture for us. When you smell this smell, it makes you run to the toilet and throw up. This smell gets up in your nostrils, and you couldn’t get it out. Torture was sitting there, 30 feet away from the death chamber, knowing that one day that’s going to be me.</p>

<p>LS: Your book is remarkable for having these very funny moments where you escape by imagining your way into amazing scenarios. But there are also moments where you are present in that space. The banging on the bars on execution nights — I was hoping you might talk about that.</p>

<p>ARH: Try to imagine: You and I live in this room for 30 years. We get to know each other, probably better than you would someone in your own household. Now, they come and it’s your time to be executed. We don’t know whether or not you have family members there. We don’t even know whether your lawyer was going to be there. No one came and said, “His mother is with him.” Banging on the bars was our way of letting the condemned know we are still here with you until the very end.</p>

<p>At one point, they used to carry out executions at 12:01 a.m. We would start beating on the bars about five minutes to 12. We would beat about 15, 20 minutes after 12. We would stop to see if we heard any noise. Every now and then one of the guards would say, “They haven’t killed him yet.” We would go back to beating on the bars.</p>

<p>LS: That’s interesting – they didn’t try to stop you.</p>

<p>ARH: The guards got to the point they understood why we did it. People don’t realize that when you go to prison, families forsake you or they don’t visit. You have to learn to develop a new family, new friends. A lot of guys had pen pals from other states and from other countries. The guards realized that it was our way of saying goodbye to someone that had no one.</p>

<p>LS: It’s a form of protest, really.</p>

<p>ARH: Absolutely. We wanted the guards to hear and we wanted the warden to hear. We would shout out, “Murderers.” We would shout out, “You’re no better than what he did.” Who was going to be put on death row for this man’s murder? I do think it made a difference. I think it made the condemned feel love. It made them feel that somebody really cared enough about me to raise hell.</p>

<p>LS: Some of the most profound parts of your book are the sections in which we get to know Henry Hays before he was executed. On my drive down here, I was listening to an audio book about his case — his crime, but also about his background, his father, who was horribly abusive. How have people responded to that portion of the book?</p>

<p>ARH: The first person who called me was my niece. She said, “Uncle Ray, how could you?” I said, “Let’s back up a moment. Henry was born Henry Francis Hayes, not “KKK Henry Francis Hayes.” I explained to her that from the time he was conceived, he was taught hate. I imagine at the age of four and five his daddy drilled in him the word “nigger” every day, all day. As he got older, he went to Klan meetings, teaching him more hate. Before he turned 15, 16, 17 – where was child protective services? We love to say it takes a village to raise a child. Where was this village when this young boy was being mentally abused? The village didn’t come out until he did something horrible. That same village that should have protected him found him guilty. This same village said, “This world would be better if you wasn’t in it.” What I find joy in is the fact that for 15 years, Henry was taught to hate, but once Henry came to death row, the very people that he was taught to hate taught him love, compassion. Henry changed and I saw the change.</p>

<p>LS: It really debunks the idea that some people are so irredeemable they have to be sentenced to die.</p>

<p>ARH: Politicians would also have you to believe it is a deterrent. Believe me, at the moment they was executing a man, somebody else was committing murder in Alabama. We need to be truthful. The death penalty serves no purpose other than the getting votes for politicians.</p>

<p>At least three different murder victims’ families have come to hear me speak. They said, “I’m against the death penalty now. I haven’t got any closure. Actually, it now gave me something more to think about. I had the date that my parents were murdered. Now I have to think of the date they executed the killer. I didn’t want that on my conscience. I just wanted … revenge.” I said, “Say it.” That’s what it is.</p>

<p>LS: One of the most emotional moments of your panel at the summit was when you described how you had never received an apology from the state. It reminded me of speaking to victims’ family members — sometimes it seems what they need more than anything to have a sense of justice would be the acknowledgement of the harm that was done to them.</p>

<p>ARH: That’s why an apology is so important. Can you imagine the victims’ family seeing me on TV, hearing somebody say, “You need to read this book by this guy”? An apology would at least acknowledge, first and foremost, I’m not the person that did the horrible crime. Second, it would acknowledge that as human beings, we make mistakes. Now, I’m going to be honest with you — there was no mistake made in my case. I was convicted because I’m a black male. But I’m willing to let the state say, “We made a mistake 33 years ago.” Somebody ought to be honest enough to say to the victims’ family, “I work for the state and we’re sorry that we didn’t catch the person — but we did let the right man go.”</p>

<p>LS: In 2003, Gov. George Ryan of Illinois commuted all death sentences and pardoned a man named Madison Hobley, who had been wrongfully convicted for killing his wife and child. He spent 16 years on death row. After his release, he came to New York and told his story like you’re doing now. This law student came up to him and said, “In the end, the system worked. You got released.” Do you ever hear anything like that?</p>

<p>ARH: I’ve had people say, “Thank God you wasn’t executed, but don’t you think that that is the price one must pay to have law and order?” I say, you have a right to feel that way, but how would you feel about that price if I had been your father, if I was your brother? Then I’ve had people that comes up to me and they’ll say, “Mr. Hinton, I’m so sorry what happened to you, but the system worked.” I said, “If the system had worked, I never would have went in the first place.”</p>

<p>LS: Some people are really resistant to accepting that these kinds of injustices have happened, whether it’s our criminal justice system now or the history EJI has put on display in these monuments. Do you feel like white folks in Alabama are responding to this message?</p>

<p>ARH: It’s too soon to know. I’m going to be honest with you. White people in Alabama know what happened. White people would love for it to stay in the closet, but it’s open, it’s out in the open. I think the white people in Alabama need to own up to responsibility. “My ancestors were a part of what happened. I feel nothing like they did, but I want to apologize in whatever way, by bringing the races together.”</p>

<p>LS: Is there anything you wish you could have included in your book that you didn’t?</p>

<p>ARH: I wish that I could have included a lot more about the men on death row — why they ended up being where they are. I wish I could have shown how we failed them. I think it was about five of us [on death row] that graduated from high school. Everybody had quit in the seventh and eighth grade. Tell me that society didn’t play a part. We still fail them because we’re spending more money on prison than we are on school. Since I’ve been out, I’ve been to white schools to speak and I thought I was at a college. They’ve got labs — Bill Gates, here they come. I’m saying, “Imagine if you could put something like this in a black neighborhood.”</p>

<p>I think about lynching. They probably lynched one of the greatest scientists of modern times. They probably lynched someone that could come up with a cure for AIDS, Alzheimer’s, cancer. We don’t know what a person can be. Earlier, we spoke of Henry Hays. Henry could still be alive today and could be in the general population getting blacks and white to come together. He could say, “I was brought up to hate. I’m telling you, it serves no purpose. If anyone knows, I know. I lived it.” But society didn’t want him to be an advocate.</p>

<p>LS: You mentioned in your book that you still have a fear of going back to death row.</p>

<p>ARH: Yes. Every time I go somewhere and I’m by myself, the fear that police could get behind me and pull me over. The fear will always be there now. I don’t disrespect them, but I trust no police.</p>

<p>LS: I noticed your car outside — it has the license plate that says “Hinton” on it.</p>

<p>ARH: Yeah.</p>

<p>LS: So you still drive that car with your name on it — fear isn’t driving you.</p>

<p>ARH: I saved up money and had this door fixed and that window fixed. When I went to get the license plate, I said, “Is it possible I can get ‘Hinton’ put on it?” The lady said, “You sure can.” I put Hinton on it because I want people to realize that for so long, I was nobody. I want you to realize that I am somebody.</p>

<h2 id="trumpliesaboutgermanyagaintocastimmigrantsasanexistentialthreat">Trump Lies About Germany, Again, to Cast Immigrants as an Existential Threat</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Robert Mackey</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-18</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/18/donald-trump-angela-merkel-germany-refugees-immigration/ </p>

<p>The president of the United States told a blatant lie about Germany on Monday, claiming that the nation’s crime rate — which is at its lowest level in 25 years — has gone “way up” since Europe granted asylum to hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing the wars in Syria and Iraq.</p>

<p>The lie, posted on Twitter by Donald Trump, was an attempt to justify the exceedingly cruel measures he ordered to deter unauthorized immigration, including the arrest of asylum-seekers at the southern border and the removal of their children for detention in cages.</p>

<p>It was widely debunked and criticized by Germans, like the political scientist Marcel Dirsus.</p>

<p>We will not be lectured on immigration by a man who locks up children in cages. https://t.co/0Yfi361UiK</p>

<p>— Marcel Dirsus (@marceldirsus) June 18, 2018</p>

<p>As Mathieu von Rohr of the German magazine Der Spiegel pointed out, Trump’s false claim about crime in Germany — which is down 5.1 percent overall since last year and 2.4 percent for violent offenses — also misled readers about the continued popularity of Chancellor Angela Merkel, even as she resists calls for a crackdown on asylum-seekers from allied conservatives in the state of Bavaria.</p>

<p>Jeremy Cliffe, the Berlin bureau chief of The Economist, noted that Trump’s grasp of the politics of immigration in Germany is also shaky. While it is certainly true that Merkel’s party has lost some support to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany, the far-right party is still supported by just 16 percent of the voters in recent polling, and its leader, Alexander Gauland, trails Merkel 50-12 in overall approval.</p>

<p>Undeterred by the facts, Trump followed his false claim with a second tweet, in which he revealed that the lie about Germany was part of a broader effort to cast immigration, at least by nonwhites, as an existential threat to both Europe and the United States.</p>

<p>While it was not clear what, exactly, Trump thinks is happening in Europe — where there has been a sharp decline in migration from the Middle East and Africa since 2015 — he repeated the comment in prepared remarks at the White House later on Monday. “The United States will not be a migrant camp and it will not be a refugee holding facility,” he said. “You look at what’s happening in Europe, you look at what’s happening in other places,” Trump added. “We can’t allow that to happen to the United States.”</p>

<p>What is particularly striking is that Trump, like Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right interior minister who recently shut his nation’s ports to migrants saved from drowning, is not responding to a real crisis but attempting to manufacture a sense of siege for political advantage at a moment when the number of undocumented immigrants seeking admission has actually declined.</p>

<p>The undocumented population in the U.S. was already declining in 2015 when Trump launched his campaign by railing against an imaginary epidemic of crime caused by Mexicans, and has continued to fall since he became president.</p>

<p>In Europe, the United Nations reports that fewer than 40,000 migrants have crossed the Mediterranean to seek refuge in the first half of this year — just 15,000 of them in Italy — compared to more than 1 million arrivals by sea in 2015.</p>

<p>Data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees shows a sharp decline in migrants crossing the Mediterranean this year.</p>

<p>In Hungary, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban focused his entire election campaign on the supposed threat posed to European civilization by Muslim migrants, the police detained just 10,415 people for entering the country without permission last year, and only 1,300 were granted asylum.</p>

<p>As he has in the past, Trump seems to be implying that harsh measures — like those taken recently by his administration and by far-right leaders in Italy and Hungary — were necessary to defend both the physical security of Europe and America, as well as to preserve their white, Christian majorities.</p>

<p>That underlying racist theme was, of course, the very loudly spoken subtext of Trump’s first speech as a candidate for the presidency, when he attacked Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals. It was there too, in his nearly obsessive criticism of Merkel during his campaign, when his speeches were punctuated — again and again and again — by false claims about a nonexistent crime wave destroying Germany, where his grandparents were born.</p>

<p>Just two weeks before Merkel responded to the migrant crisis of 2015 by opening Germany’s borders to refugees, Trump told Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business that the German chancellor was “a fantastic leader — I was with somebody the other day who thinks she’s the greatest leader in the world today, she’s the smartest and the greatest leader in the world today.”</p>

<p>Two months later, Trump told a crowd in Knoxville, Tennessee, that he no longer admired Merkel. “I think what she did to Germany is a disgrace,” he said. He went on to say that giving shelter to Syrians would “destroy all of Europe” and falsely claimed that “they’re having riots in the streets; they’re having crime that they’ve never had before.”</p>

<p>“We talk about immigration, we talk about borders. Do you see what she’s done to Germany?” Trump asked a crowd in New Hampshire two months later, after Merkel was named Time magazine’s Person of the Year instead of him. “The crime is astronomical. It’s not working. They’re having riots now in the street, and the German people are now saying, ‘We’ve had it; we’ve had it.’ We can’t let that happen to us.”</p>

<p>“Germany is a behemoth, an economic behemoth. It’s being destroyed by what Merkel has done there, what she has done to Germany,” Trump told supporters in South Carolina in February 2016. “I have friends from Germany, they’re leaving Germany,” he continued. “These are people who were so proud, a year ago, of being in Germany — German people. They were so proud, they used to brag. I said, ‘Are you still proud?’ Not so proud.”</p>

<p>The culmination of Trump’s attacks on the German leader for her openness to refugees from the Middle East and Africa was a line he trotted out in Ohio in August 2016. “Hillary Clinton wants to be America’s Angela Merkel,” Trump read from a teleprompter, before pausing to allow for boos. “And you know what a disaster this massive immigration has been to Germany and the people of Germany,” he continued. “Crime has risen to levels that no one thought they would ever, ever see. It is a catastrophe.”</p>

<h2 id="trumpcabinetsbiblestudyministerjustifieschildseparationasconsequenceofimmigrantsillegalbehavior">Trump Cabinet’s Bible Study Minister Justifies Child Separation as Consequence of Immigrants’ “Illegal Behavior”</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Lee Fang</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/19/capitol-ministries-trump-family-separation/ </p>

<p>Amid increasing scrutiny of President Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration policies, criticisms have been lodged against the policy of family separation at the border by, among others, members of his own party and otherwise stalwart Christian right allies of the GOP. One Christian ally of the White House, though, came out swinging in favor of taking children away from their parents: Capitol Ministries.</p>

<p>Ralph Drollinger, the head of the private Christian group, which leads Bible study sessions for Republican lawmakers and senior members of Trump’s Cabinet, led the charge to defend the administration even as photos and stories emerge showing children crowded into cages and snatched from their mothers.</p>

<p>“It follows that when someone breaks the law of the land that they should anticipate that one of the consequences of their illegal behavior will be separation from their children.</p>

<p>“No one, especially my personal friend, the kind-hearted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, desires that a mother or father be separated from their children,” wrote Drollinger, in a message to supporters on Friday. But, the Capitol Ministries leader said, there are “three classifications of people in every country, as was true in ancient Israel in the Old Testament.” In Drollinger’s interpretation, there are citizens, legal immigrants, and foreigners — the latter were known as being “illegal,” he said — and the Bible only forbids family separation for citizens and legal immigrants.</p>

<p>“It follows that when someone breaks the law of the land that they should anticipate that one of the consequences of their illegal behavior will be separation from their children,” Drollinger wrote. “Such is the case with thieves or murderers who are arrested and put in jail.”</p>

<p>Sessions attracted controversy after citing a Bible verse to defend the administration’s “zero-tolerance” border enforcement strategy. “I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13, to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes,” the attorney general declared during a speech in Fort Wayne, Indiana, last Thursday.</p>

<p>Despite the support from a right-wing Christian group that’s especially close to the administration, other conservative Christians are pressuring the Trump administration to change its practices. Earlier this month, a group of evangelical pastors signed a letter harshly condemning the child separation policy. “The traumatic effects of this separation on these young children, which could be devastating and long lasting, are of utmost concern,” stated the letter, which was signed by the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, who gave an opening prayer at Trump’s inauguration and is reportedly close to the president, among other evangelical leaders.</p>

<p>Drollinger, who has become immensely influential following the 2016 election, believes Sessions correctly invoked the scripture.</p>

<p>“The passage the Attorney General cited, Romans 13, bespeaks of this: there are and there should be serious, known consequences for breaking the laws of the land — otherwise the law becomes toothless and inconsequential and it is no longer a deterrent to harmful behavior, which is what God designed it to be,” Drollinger wrote, citing his own Bible study on illegal immigration, published on the Capitol Ministries website two years ago.</p>

<p>“To procedurally exclude foreign individuals who might be criminals, traitors, or terrorists, or who possess communicable diseases is not racist in the least!”</p>

<p>In the 2016 Bible study, Drollinger wrote that “immigration laws of every nation should be Biblically based and strictly enforced — all with the utmost confidence that assurance that God approves such actions by the nation’s leaders.” He added, “To procedurally exclude foreign individuals who might be criminals, traitors, or terrorists, or who possess communicable diseases is not racist in the least!”</p>

<p>Drollinger, a former college basketball star turned spiritual adviser to conservative politicians, has quietly amassed power in Washington, D.C., through his Monday evening Bible studies with conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Several Cabinet members, including the vice president and Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, pray on a regular basis with Drollinger’s group. As the minister recently told a German newspaper, he provides the administration with “the high-protein diet of the Word of God.” In the past, Drollinger bashed gay rights and called Catholicism the “world’s largest false religion.”</p>

<p>As The Intercept first reported, shortly after the presidential election, Drollinger could barely conceal his excitement that members of his inner circle would soon occupy the White House. He published a press statement celebrating the fact that Trump’s appointments for his administration were drawn from “long time sponsors of the Members Bible Studies.”</p>

<p>“It follows then that the sudden rise of Pence, Sessions, and Pompeo — all men who are disciples of Jesus Christ — serve to vividly illustrate the truth of 1 Timothy 2:1-4!” Drollinger announced, referring to a Bible verse that calls for prayer “for kings and all who are in authority.”</p>

<p>Drollinger’s controversial interpretations extend to other areas of GOP orthodoxy. Capitol Ministries claims “that Islam and its Koran are nothing more than a plagiarism of OT truths” — a reference to the Old Testament — “and a non-chronological, sloppy one at that — topped off with a falsified diminution of Jesus Christ.”</p>

<h2 id="alabamaslynchingmemorialandthelegacyofracialterrorinthesouth">Alabama’s Lynching Memorial and the Legacy of Racial Terror in the South</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Liliana Segura</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-16</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/17/lynching-museum-alabama-death-penalty/ </p>

<p>A week before the crowds arrived in Montgomery for the opening of the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, a monument to victims of lynching in the United States, Alabama prepared to kill 83-year-old Walter Moody. From his death watch cell at Holman prison, Moody called his attorney the night before he was to die. “He said, ‘An EMT was just in here and he seemed concerned about my veins,’” said Spencer Hahn, a lawyer with the Alabama Middle District Federal Defender.</p>

<p>There were good reasons to worry. Moody would be the oldest person executed in the so-called modern death penalty era — and problems finding viable veins had led to an unprecedented disaster at Holman a few months before. For more than two hours, prison personnel had tried and failed to place intravenous lines into the body of 61-year-old Doyle Lee Hamm. The execution was finally called off close to midnight, leaving Hamm bloody and traumatized. His lawyers called it torture. But the state was dismissive. “I wouldn’t necessarily characterize what we had tonight as a problem,” Alabama Department of Corrections Commissioner Jeffrey Dunn told the press.</p>

<p>Hahn filed a last-minute motion on Moody’s behalf, to no avail. On April 19, he and his boss, Christine Freeman, made the trip down I-65 to Holman to witness the execution. Moody was the seventh client Freeman has seen put to death. It began like all the others. “They open the curtains, the prisoner is there on the gurney,” she said. Moody’s arms were extended, forming the eerie crucifix shape. There was just one problem. Their client appeared to be sound asleep.</p>

<p>“I thought he was dead,” Hahn recalls. “He was breathing so shallowly.” But officials carried on as if everything were normal. The warden entered the execution chamber with a microphone. Speakers were flipped on for witnesses to hear as she read the execution order aloud. Then, absurdly, the warden asked the unconscious Moody if he had any last words. “She holds the microphone up and then she just quickly pulls it back and turns and walks away,” Freeman said.</p>

<p>“I think he was given a drug,” Freeman said. “I don’t know what the drug was, I don’t know if he asked for it or not.” To execute a man potentially unaware that he was about to die would be a serious violation of his rights. In fact, just weeks earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court had blocked another Alabama execution amid concerns over the condemned man’s dementia. But Dunn denied anything was amiss. Moody was pronounced dead at 8:42 p.m.</p>

<p>The state’s nothing-to-see-here posture was a “façade,” Freeman said, but it was one she has come to expect. In December 2016, Alabama executed her client Ronald Bert Smith, who “heaved and coughed and clenched his left fist,” as one media witness reported. “It was just awful to see,” Freeman recalled. Rather than investigate what went wrong, Alabama officials “launched a campaign of obfuscation and misinformation about what happened to him,” Freeman’s former colleague, an outspoken critic of Alabama’s lethal injection regime, wrote. “They just say whatever needs to be said, in order to ensure that they get to continue to do what they do,” Hahn said.</p>

<p>This is not just true in Alabama. I was at the prison known as the Cummins Unit the night Arkansas killed Kenneth Williams in April 2017 — the last in a series of controversial executions using a new lethal injection protocol. Defense attorneys had warned for months that things were likely to go wrong, but the state refused to listen. Press witnesses returned to the media room with disturbing reports, describing how Williams convulsed and struggled for breath before he died. But a governor’s spokesperson declared that everything had gone fine. In the year since the execution, I could not shake the brazen denial; the chilling directive that witnesses ignore what they saw; that it had not really happened that way.</p>

<p>“This system pushes everyone into a place of unreality,” said Freeman. It reminded me of the words of an anti-lynching activist I read before arriving in Alabama. “A lynching makes a lot of otherwise good people go blind or lose their memories.”</p>

<p>“What Led to This Point?”</p>

<p>The office of Alabama’s Middle District Federal Defender sits on a quiet block in Montgomery, just a mile up the road from the Equal Justice Initiative. The famed legal nonprofit was founded in 1989 by renowned capital defense attorney Bryan Stevenson, who has attended his own share of executions. Stevenson has made it his life’s work to transform how Americans think about our criminal justice system, by tracing its origins and making them visible. Outside its downtown headquarters on Commerce Street, a historical marker stands where “enslaved people were marched in chains up the street from the riverfront and railroad station to the slave auction site or to local slave depots.” In a state that officially celebrates Martin Luther King’s birthday alongside that of Robert E. Lee, it is part of a broader effort, EJI explains, to “reshape the cultural landscape” to “more truthfully and accurately reflect our history.”</p>

<p>On April 26, EJI opened two new monuments in Montgomery: the National Memorial for Peace and Justice — commemorating more than 4,400 victims of lynching in the United States between 1877 and 1950 — and the Legacy Museum, which traces the evolution from “mass enslavement to mass incarceration.” A two-day Peace and Justice Summit at the convention center brought musicians, food trucks, and speakers like Michelle Alexander, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, and film director Ava DuVernay. The lynching memorial commanded the most attention. The long pavilion stands on a hill overlooking Montgomery, where Confederate monuments sit close to historic sites of the civil rights movement. On opening day, visitors and volunteers crowded the entrance. Inside, a wide path opened and turned toward the memorial, past a sculptor’s arresting portrayal of anguished men and women in shackles. Along a wall, large signs narrated the end of the slave trade to the collapse of Reconstruction and the emergence of “racial terror lynchings” as a means of enforcing white control of the South.</p>

<p>Entering the memorial at the top of the hill, steel rectangular columns stood at eye level, suspended from metal poles. The coppery orange pillars looked weathered and scarred, each one engraved with the names of counties and the lynching victims who died there. Some had only first or last names, others read “Unknown.” Walking further into the memorial, the floor began to curve and descend and the columns got higher and higher, until eventually the rows hung in an overwhelming canopy.</p>

<p>There were some 840 pillars total. Visitors quietly sought out those associated with their family roots, taking pictures with their phones. The names were largely unfamiliar to me — generations of men, women, and children buried in revisionist history. But many locations were all too familiar. One of the first I saw was Lincoln County, Arkansas, where Kenneth Williams was executed. Six lynchings were inscribed on its surface.</p>

<p>Near the entrance, I found Butts County, Georgia, the site of only two recorded lynchings — a small number for Georgia. But Butts County is home to the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson. Troy Davis was killed there in 2011. I was outside the prison five years later, when a man named Kenneth Fults was executed despite the racist remarks of a juror, who said, “I don’t know if he ever killed anybody, but that nigger got just what should have happened.”</p>

<p>Further down, I found Sunflower County, Mississippi, the site of 12 recorded lynchings, and where I once toured the execution chamber at Parchman Farm. Near the exit was West Feliciana Parish, most famous for the Louisiana State Penitentiary — a former slave plantation known as Angola, the country from which its inhabitants were stolen. Men still work the fields at Angola. Most are black, and the majority are serving life sentences. When I visited years ago, members of the Angola Three had been locked in solitary confinement for nearly four decades.</p>

<p>Of the seven lynchings recorded on the pillar for West Feliciana Parish, the last took place in 1933 — the decade in which lynchings began to decline and legal executions rose throughout the South. In 1947, the U.S. Supreme Court considered the case of a black teenager named Willie Francis, who had gone to Louisiana’s electric chair but, gruesomely, survived. In a decision still cited today, the majority found that attempting to kill him again would not violate the Eighth Amendment. “Accidents happen,” the ruling read, “for which no man is to blame.”</p>

<p>Lynchings were once carried out “at the hands of persons unknown,” in the official language of the state. Though the identities of the perpetrators were often an open secret, newspapers “absolved their local leaders of responsibility,” Sherrilyn Ifill writes in “On the Courthouse Lawn: Confronting the Legacy of Lynching in the Twenty-First Century.” Aided by a compliant press, a “consensus story” formed: “The lynchers were ‘outsiders’ who could not be recognized.”</p>

<p>Stevenson calls the death penalty the “stepchild of lynching.” At the Legacy Museum, the parallel is starkly drawn. Yet historians who have probed the precise connection have been hamstrung by an absence of reliable data. The federal government never bothered to count the thousands of lynchings that terrorized black communities across the country; and it did not start keeping track of legal executions until 1930. That there is any historical record of lynchings is thanks to institutions like the Tuskegee Institute and activists like Ida B. Wells. A database of early executions exists because of the work of Watt Espy, an Alabama researcher who died in 2009. Nevertheless, the link is unmistakable in the South, where both lynchings and early executions were lawless forms of racial control. Public executions looked a lot like lynchings — and the justifications for both were often the same.</p>

<p>But even as lynchings persisted in the early 20th century, legal executions began to evolve, “from widely attended public hangings to tightly controlled official events held under high security in state prisons,” as Memphis historian Margaret Vandiver writes in “Lethal Punishment: Lynchings and Legal Executions in the South.” Today, the legal framework governing the death penalty is complex and impenetrable — and executions are more secretive and sanitized than ever. This long evolution can make the link between lynching and the death penalty feel tenuous and disorienting in 2018. Last year in Charleston, South Carolina, I watched as Dylann Roof was sentenced to die for the slaughter of nine black people, under the authority of a black president.</p>

<p>I came to Alabama to bridge another disconnect, one that spans my own lifetime: the distinction we created between the “modern death penalty era” and everything that came before. In between are the four years separating two landmark Supreme Court rulings: Furman v. Georgia, which struck down the death penalty in 1972, and Gregg v. Georgia, which upheld it in 1976. Gregg ushered in an age of state-sanctioned killing that would transform executions to look modern and humane, while closing a chapter in death penalty history that is now rarely invoked. For all the data we have amassed showing discrimination in capital punishment, its roots in racial terror have been severed from our collective memory. Today, even abolitionists describe the death penalty as “broken,” as if there were ever a time when it was carried out fairly, as a legitimate expression of society’s outrage.</p>

<p>For Freeman, who drove past the site of the pavilion almost every day as it was under construction, walking through the memorial was a jolt of perspective. “When you’re caught up in the minutia of your case, you’re not saying, ‘How did we get to this point?’” she said. EJI reminds us that “we created a bunch of laws to keep people in prison so that they could provide labor. And then the rest of us started to assume those laws made sense. And then we demonized certain portions of our citizens, and people started to think that made sense. I think it’s really critical that we always ask why,” she said. “Why are we here? What led to this point?”</p>

<p>A New Order of Things</p>

<p>Eufaula, Alabama, sits on the border with Georgia, some 85 miles southeast of Montgomery. On the cusp of Alabama’s Black Belt, the city was once prosperous from cotton plantations and a railroad built by slave labor, later becoming the “fugitive seat of the Government of Alabama,” toward the end of the Civil War. Today, Lake Eufaula is famous for big mouth bass, and its historic district is lauded in travel magazines. A Confederate monument overlooks a traffic circle downtown, where every spring the “Eufaula pilgrimage” features Southern belles in hoop skirts welcoming visitors to tour antebellum architecture.</p>

<p>Like other parts of the South after emancipation, Eufaula was the site of violent measures to roll back the gains made during Reconstruction. On the morning of Alabama’s critical 1874 elections, members of the White League carried out a notorious slaughter of black Republicans in Eufaula, driving scores of would-be voters from the polls. The mob later broke into a polling place north of town, fatally shooting the teenage son of a white Republican judge. Today, on U.S. Highway 82, a historical marker commemorates the “Election Riot of 1874,” which “marked the end of the Republican domination in Barbour County.” No black victims are mentioned.</p>

<p>In a sunny history of Eufaula published the following year, a local writer celebrated a renewed sense of optimism — “a new order of things is fully inaugurated,” he wrote. Just as the Black Codes did after the Civil War, new laws re-criminalized black people; in “Black Prisoners and Their World: Alabama, 1865-1900,” historian Mary Ellen Curtin describes how these years “established a solid practice of whites turning to the courts to prosecute African Americans for purposes of social control.” Between 1874 and 1877, she writes, the black incarcerated population of the state tripled. Convict leasing became the law of the land.</p>

<p>At the same time, lynchings were on the rise. In 1881, a black man in Eufaula was chased across the border to Georgia and killed by a mob for allegedly assaulting a white girl. “There was a rumor among the blacks that the wrong man had been hung,” the Eufaula Times and News reported, “but the writer, as well as every one who has taken the pains to learn the facts, knows that such was not the case.” Like many newspapers in the South and North alike, the Times and News wrote approvingly of lynchings, particularly to punish “outrageous assaults upon white women,” as the Eufaula newspaper wrote in 1885. Such crimes were increasing, it warned — and lynchings were “the only remedy.” The article dismissed those who denied that lynching worked as a deterrent. “White men and law-abiding tax-payers do not care to feed, week after week in jail, and incur other expenses in bringing to punishment such fiends in human shape.”</p>

<p>There was no evidence behind the hysteria over sexual violence against white women by black men. But the manufactured threat had embedded itself firmly in the Southern psyche. According to EJI, “Nearly 25 percent of the lynchings of African Americans in the South were based on charges of sexual assault” — and an allegation alone was enough. When pioneering journalist Ida B. Wells dared to suggest that the real fear animating such propaganda was of miscegenation – and showed evidence that some lynching victims had, in fact, been in consensual, clandestine relationships with white women — she was forced to flee her home in Memphis.</p>

<p>Wells’s defiant activism would spur a wave of bad press about Southern lynchings. After a series of her lectures abroad, Southern governors felt compelled to respond. “I am opposed to lynch law for anything but rape,” the governor of South Carolina insisted in a 1884 letter printed in the Eufaula Times and News. The governors of Georgia and Virginia were also “highly indignant,” another Alabama newspaper reported, reminding readers that while lynch mobs might be deplorable, the crimes they sought to punish were far worse. Undeterred, Wells published the Red Record the following year, including lynching statistics and featuring a postcard from a lynching in Clanton, Alabama. Activists would learn to weaponize such photos in the years to come, and eventually lynchings would fall out of favor. But even in 1895, the Eufaula Times and News showed a shift in rhetoric. There were doubts over the guilt of a recently lynched man in Florida, the paper reported that summer. Hasty acts of passion did not “make the same profound impression that imprisonment, trial by jury, and legal execution carry with them. Lynchings are not as deterrent of crime as legal punishment.”</p>

<p>In 1900, as Alabama prepared to ratify a new constitution enshrining white supremacy by law, a major event was held in Montgomery: the first conference of the Southern Society for the Promotion of the Study of Race Conditions and Problems in the South. Over three days in May, speakers looked to the future, while bidding good riddance to the dangerous ideas of the Reconstruction era. “In that day, miscegenation was by many looked upon with so little of horror that even Alabama judges on our Supreme Court bench decided that no law of the State could interfere with the right of whites and negroes to intermarry,” a former Alabama congressman declared in his introductory remarks. Fortunately, he added, a new legal era was in place, “and we shall never more hear of such decisions.” Still, the “Negro problem” had not been resolved. Conference attendees agreed that the 15th Amendment had failed, that science proved the inferiority of black people, and that the abolition of slavery had spawned a generation of black men who posed a threat to white women everywhere.</p>

<p>On the third day, a lawyer from Atlanta delivered a lecture titled, “The Punishment of Crimes Against Women, Existing Legal Remedies and Their Sufficiency.” “Even some of those who decry lynching and wish to have punishment meted out according to law are clamoring for some new method of procedure and punishment, which shall not only swiftly annihilate the criminal; but strike terror to the ignorant and criminals of the race,” he announced. South Carolina was leading the way, he noted. The previous year, newspapers had reported the state’s “first legal execution for criminal assault.”</p>

<p>Rape had long been punishable by death in the South, at least when the victims were white, but capital punishment had largely subsided at the time. In Alabama, according to the Espy File, no legal executions had been carried out from 1869 to 1874. But soon Southern states began to revise their death penalty laws. As Northern states had done decades before, many states moved executions away from public view and inside local jails, although certain exceptions remained, ostensibly to serve as a deterrent. “In 1901,” Stuart Banner writes in “The Death Penalty: An American History,” “Arkansas abolished public hanging except for rape, a crime for which capital punishment was in practice largely limited to blacks. … Kentucky, which had abolished public hanging in 1880, brought it back for rape and attempted rape in 1920, at the discretion of local officials.”</p>

<p>Newspaper reports from the turn of the century show a series of “firsts” throughout the South. In 1905, the first legal execution for “criminal assault” in North Carolina’s Sampson County was attended by 25 people, who had bought tickets for the occasion. That same year, Fulton County, Georgia carried out its first legal execution for criminal assault, hanging the “Negro assailant” of the wife of an Atlanta merchant. Legal executions were spreading for new crimes as well. In 1903, three black men were hanged for robbery for the first time in Alabama. That same year, 5,000 people attended the first legal execution in Randolph County, Alabama. The Advertiser reported it in detail, describing a number of humane touches: the man’s “hearty breakfast,” a last cigarette that evening, and the moving goodbye between the condemned and his wife. (“Seldom is such faithfulness seen in the colored race.”)</p>

<p>The rise of legal executions was widely regarded as a positive trend. In April 1903, an Alabama paper reported that Mississippi had not seen a single lynching since the start of the year. Records suggested the reason was a “plentitude of legal hangings.” Still, lynchings continued, and newspapers defended those they deemed justified. In 1906, two black men accused of raping white children were seized from a train by a lynch mob in Mobile. The governor was notified but did not intervene. “The Mob Was Very Orderly,” the Montgomery Advertiser wrote, noting that even a “legal hanging could not have been more quiet.”</p>

<p>By 1915, according to EJI’s Lynching in America, “Court-ordered executions outpaced lynchings in the former slave states for the first time.” In Alabama, following the botched hanging of a white man — “Grewsome and Harrowing Scenes enacted at County Jail Today Demand Change In This State,” the Montgomery Times announced — officials decided that it was time to make executions more befitting of a civilized age. Other states had already begun killing people by electrocution, a modern marvel that captured the popular imagination. In 1923, Alabama joined other states in moving executions to the middle of the night and the first electric chair was installed in Montgomery’s Kilby prison.</p>

<p>The first to die in the electric chair was a black man named Horace de Vaughn. The Montgomery Advertiser described an air of solemnity — de Vaughn was respectful, sitting down unassisted, and the prison “was wrapped in absolute silence.” A doctor declared it the best execution he’d ever seen, the newspaper announced. “Alabama justice has been carried into execution in as quick, painless and clean a manner as science has been able to devise.”</p>

<p>The trials that led to state-sanctioned executions were utterly devoid of due process. But that would begin to change, at least in theory. In 1932, the U.S. Supreme Court took on one of the most famous miscarriages of justice in American history: the case of the Scottsboro Boys, nine youths accused of raping two white women in 1931. Newspapers called them “fiends” and mobs gathered outside the courthouse during their trials, where they were represented by incompetent attorneys, one of whom was visibly drunk. The Supreme Court found that the men’s right to a fair trial had been violated. But similar “legal lynchings” would continue. In 1944, South Carolina executed a 14-year-old boy named George Stinney, convicted in 10 minutes by an all-white jury.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as Alabama’s electric chair approached its 10-year anniversary, the Montgomery Advertiser assessed its record. “Of the 55 who passed through the little green door to die,” it reported, “47 were negroes and eight were white.”</p>

<p>A State of Denial</p>

<p>The lynching marker in Tuscaloosa is located on Sixth Street, in front of the old county jail. A couple blocks east, a six-lane boulevard cuts through downtown, named for the wife of segregationist ex-Gov. George Wallace. On the other side, a cluster of trendy shops and restaurants leads to the University of Alabama campus. On the Saturday after the EJI Peace and Justice Summit in Montgomery, a free outdoor concert attracted a mostly white crowd to an event called Alabama Roots Fest.</p>

<p>The lynching marker on the other side of the boulevard was placed by EJI in 2017. The last victim mentioned, David Cross, was shot to death in 1933 by a mob dressed as police officers, who accused him of trying to assault a white woman at a country club. “The County Sheriff later stated that the woman Cross was accused of assaulting had in fact never been attacked,” it reads.</p>

<p>On the South Side, just over the railroad tracks in a black neighborhood people still call Shacktown, I met the family of a man on Alabama’s death row who maintains his innocence. The man’s fiancée, a teacher named Crystal, had not been to Montgomery for years — she was only vaguely aware of EJI’s new memorial and museum. “That’s a good reason to go,” she said. History is not accurately taught in Tuscaloosa, she told me. The “misleading” begins as early as pre-K, she said, when kids learn about Christopher Columbus. “When it comes to black history, it’s just that one month.”</p>

<p>The link between lynchings and the death penalty felt logical to Crystal in a way that racism in Tuscaloosa is instinctive and familiar. “You just kind of have to live it,” she said. Black people in Tuscaloosa are heavily policed, including by campus officers with the University of Alabama. “They tolerate the athletes,” Crystal said, but black people from her side of town otherwise stay away.</p>

<p>In the ’50s and ’60s, the university was the scene of riots protesting desegregation. Years before Wallace notoriously blocked the schoolhouse doors on campus, a black woman named Autherine Lucy was briefly enrolled at UA, only to be met by mobs who threw eggs, burned desegregationist literature, and waved Confederate flags. The university board expelled Lucy — ostensibly for her own protection – but she would return to the College of Education decades later. Last year, six months after EJI erected the lynching marker, the university honored Lucy with a historical marker of her own, lauding her role in making the university “truly ‘one for all.’”</p>

<p>The Tuscaloosa campus holds a piece of EJI’s history too. When the office first opened in 1989, under the banner of the Alabama Capital Representation Project, its original headquarters were at the law school building. In his best-selling memoir, “Just Mercy,” Bryan Stevenson describes how the university withdrew its support within the first few months of operation, “and we discovered just how hard it was to find lawyers to come to Alabama and do full-time death penalty work for less than $25,000 a year.” Months later, the office moved to Montgomery.</p>

<p>When Stevenson first arrived in Alabama in the early 1980s, the state was outpacing the rest of the country in sending people to death row. There was no public defender system, Stevenson writes, “which meant that large numbers of death row prisoners had no legal representation of any kind.” Stevenson had not planned to stay in Alabama. He had come to the South as a Harvard law student, to take an internship with the Southern Prisoners Defense Committee in Georgia. He often tells the story of meeting then-Director Stephen Bright, a famed capital defense attorney, on a layover to Atlanta. Bright became an instant mentor. “We can’t help people on death row without help from people like you,” he told Stevenson. For more than a year, Stevenson slept on Bright’s living room couch while learning to defend indigent clients.</p>

<p>Bright was among the speakers at the Peace and Justice Summit in Montgomery. In a brown suit and tie, he described how he has seen the legacy of lynching in capital cases throughout his career. Today, he said, “80 percent of all death sentences are in states from the old Confederacy.” He repeated a line he had written many years ago, in an article called “Discrimination, Death and Denial.” American criminal courts are the institutions “least affected by the civil rights movement.”</p>

<p>A major reason is the judiciary’s longtime failure to acknowledge the racism in the criminal justice system. Even as the U.S. Supreme Court sought to impose due process in capital cases, decades of rulings would immunize the criminal justice system from challenges based on race. Bright has described countless examples in his writing; in the court’s 1965 ruling in Swain v. Alabama, the justices upheld a death sentence out of Talladega County, whose population was more than a quarter black, even though there was evidence “that due to peremptory challenges, no black person had ever served on a jury in either a criminal or civil case.” The ruling — “disapproving of racial discrimination but allowing it to continue by setting a virtually impossible standard of proof” — was the controlling law for 20 years.</p>

<p>It was around this same time that the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund (LDF) set out to prove what many had long known to be true: that the death penalty was particularly racist when it came to rape cases, a direct legacy of lynchings. In the summer of 1965, a group of law students traveled South to gather statistics; one case they found was that of Billy Maxwell, sentenced to death in 1962 for the rape of a white woman in Arkansas. At trial, Maxwell’s lawyer had shown evidence that, of 20 men convicted and sent to die for rape between 1930 and 1960, “all but one was black,” one participant wrote years later. Armed with additional statistics, Maxwell’s case made it all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which vacated his death sentence. But it did so on a different matter, leaving the issue of race unaddressed.</p>

<p>Just a few years later, thanks to the ongoing work of the LDF, the court handed down its landmark decision in Furman v. Georgia. The justices had been presented with exhaustive statistics laying out the death penalty’s racial bias. Yet in a series of separate opinions, the majority mostly talked around race, describing death sentences as “arbitrary” and “capricious.” A national moratorium on executions followed — but that did not stop states from continuing to send people to death row. No sooner did state legislatures pass new statutes than prosecutors sought new death sentences. In 1976, the Supreme Court upheld a new set of laws in Gregg v. Georgia, giving the green light to restart executions.</p>

<p>“To think that all of the problems identified in Furman — the racism, the consequences of poverty — to think that you could have that fixed in four years was just so incredibly preposterous,” Bright told me a few years ago. Perhaps more absurd, in 1977 the justices struck down the death penalty for rape in Coker v. Georgia, while managing to avoid mentioning race at all. But its most devastating decision regarding race and the criminal justice system came 10 years later, in the case of Warren McCleskey, a black man represented by Stevenson and Bright. In its 5-4 decision in McCleskey v. Kemp, the court said discrimination in the criminal justice system was “inevitable,” in the words of Justice Lewis Powell, and held that a sentence was not unconstitutional unless a defendant could prove that the racial bias had been intentional — a “crippling burden of proof,” as described by the LDF. Anthony Amsterdam, the lawyer who argued Furman before the court, called McCleskey “the Dredd Scott of our time.”</p>

<p>Legal scholars have since exposed one concern underlying the decision in McCleskey. “Although the point was not discussed in the majority opinion,” writes Jeffrey Kirchmeier, author of “Imprisoned by the Past: Warren McCleskey and the American Death Penalty,” the justices were concerned that a ruling in favor of McCleskey would effectively dismantle the death penalty. “During the justices’ discussion of the case,” Kirchmeier writes, “Powell warned in an interoffice memo, ‘This case presents, as we know, an attack on capital punishment itself.’”</p>

<p>By then, the Supreme Court’s refusal to acknowledge racism had already enabled plausible deniability about the death penalty’s discriminatory application. In Alabama, where the fight over passing a new death penalty law after Furman split lawmakers along racial lines in 1973, one Mobile Republican was offended when a black representative asked his colleagues to search their consciences and warned that reviving the death penalty would turn the clock backward for black people. “When the Brown v. Board of Education decision came out, I applauded,” he said. “But I feel you are guilty of racism in reverse.”</p>

<p>A historic marker commemorates the last lynching in the state of Alabama.</p>

<p>On a residential block in Mobile, Alabama, a historic marker stands in front of a tree, commemorating the last lynching in the state. “On March 21, 1981,” it reads, “19-year-old Michael Donald was abducted, beaten, killed, and hung from a tree on this street by members of the Ku Klux Klan.” The marker, installed in 2009 as part of Mobile’s African American Heritage Trail, described how the crime — “retaliation for an interracial jury failing to convict a black man for killing a white Birmingham policeman” — led to a famous civil suit against the Klan, brought by Donald’s mother and the Southern Poverty Law Center, which bankrupted the KKK.</p>

<p>The Donald case also marked a turning point in Alabama’s death penalty history. At the time of the lynching, lawmakers had been forced to revise their new death penalty law, after sections had been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. In July 1981, a new law took effect in Alabama. Modeled after Florida’s death penalty law, it was controversial for allowing non-unanimous juries to recommend death sentences. Yet another critical provision was overlooked: the vast discretion it gave to judges to override jurors in capital cases.</p>

<p>As Henry Hays, one of Donald’s murderers, went to trial in 1983, evidence of racism in Alabama’s death penalty system had already emerged. That year, a Talladega College professor presented findings that Alabama had the highest percentage of black people on death row among Southern states — and study of death sentences from 1976 to 1981 had showed that killing a white person in Alabama was 10 times more likely to face the death penalty than someone who killed a black person. Officials issued vociferous denials — “There’s no way that can be true,” said Alabama Assistant Attorney General Ed Carnes, who helped author the law. But after Hays was convicted in December 1983, the mostly white jury recommended a life sentence — the perfect emblem of Alabama’s racist double standards.</p>

<p>Because Donald’s murder predated the new legislation, the trial judge was not technically authorized to override the jury’s sentence in Hays’ case. But in early 1984, he did so anyway. Some applauded the move, but others saw it as a cynical deflection — a way to show that Alabama’s death penalty wasn’t racist after all. In the decades that followed, Alabama became notorious for “judicial override.” The power was eagerly exploited by the state’s elected judges, who could boast on the campaign trail about their death penalty record. By the time judicial override was finally abolished last year, Mobile led the state in capital prosecutions; in 2016, the Harvard-based Fair Punishment Project named it a death penalty “outlier,” one of the few remaining places in the country where prosecutors still aggressively seek death sentences.</p>

<p>Today, the legacy of Alabama’s 1981 law is evident in the words of a trial judge who, in 1999, explained why he overrode the jury in sentencing a white man to die. “If I had not imposed the death sentence,” he said, “I would have sentenced three black people to death and no white people.”</p>

<p>Anthony Ray Hinton stands near the spot in the yard of his home in Quinton, Ala., where police officers came to arrest him for crimes he didn’t commit in 1985.</p>

<p>“They have to put a few white guys on death row to make you think it’s not about race,” said Anthony Ray Hinton. We were at the EJI office in Montgomery, talking about Dylann Roof. Cases like that are a “distraction,” Hinton said. If executions don’t look like lynchings anymore, it’s only because the machinery is different. “They brought the tree from outside and put it inside.”</p>

<p>Hinton knows too well how racism drives the death penalty in Alabama. Sentenced to die in 1986 for two murders he didn’t commit, he spent nearly 30 years on death row before being exonerated with the help of EJI in 2015. In his memoir, “The Sun Does Shine,” Hinton describes how his cell stood 30 feet from Alabama’s execution chamber, so close he could smell the burning flesh of men killed in the electric chair. He was still on death row when the state switched to lethal injection in 2002. As in other states, the protocol was designed to look humane. But Hinton knew better than to consider it any less cruel. When we met, he was still disturbed by Doyle Lee Hamm’s bloody ordeal months before.</p>

<p>At the EJI summit in Montgomery, where he spoke alongside Stephen Bright, Hinton had become emotional as he described how the state has yet to acknowledge his wrongful conviction. “To this day,” he said, “nobody in the governor’s office or the attorney general’s office or nowhere has had the decency to say, ‘Mr. Hinton, we’re sorry.’” Freeman was in the audience that afternoon. For her decades doing capital defense work in the South, his story made deeply her indignant. “It’s just this denying, denying, denying,” she said. “We just don’t want to believe that our system is that fallible. … In my view, it is part and parcel with the commissioner standing up and saying, ‘It all went according to plan.’”</p>

<p>For Hinton, telling his story is exhausting — “like reliving a nightmare,” he told me. But it is the only way to combat the state’s denial. So he tells it over and over again. Fifty-four executions were carried out while Hinton was at Holman. Among those friends he saw walk to their death was Henry Hays, the former Klansman sentenced to die in 1984. Hays, Hinton says, changed in the years he lived on death row, and the men formed an unlikely bond. On the night Hays died in 1997, Hinton and the men on death row banged the bars so that he would hear them. “Black. White. It didn’t matter,” Hinton writes. “I screamed so that whoever was there to watch the state of Alabama kill in their name knew that we were real men and that you couldn’t hide us under a black hood and pretend we didn’t feel pain.”</p>

<p>For lawyers like Freeman, who cannot protest, the experience is another kind of denial. It is a strange thing, she says, to fight for years for your client’s life only to sit still and watch as the state kills them in the name of the law. “You look at them and think, ‘Aren’t I supposed to do something? Aren’t I supposed to go up to the wall and bang on the window and say, Stop it?’” she said. “But everybody’s such a cog in the machine at that point. Nobody stops it.”</p>

<p>On June 1, a new law went into effect in Alabama, allowing condemned prisoners to choose a new way to die: nitrogen gas. Like his predecessors did when promoting the electric chair and lethal injection, the sponsor of the legislation vowed the new execution method would be humane, although it has never been used before. In the meantime, I returned from Montgomery to a letter from death row, written by the man whose family I met in Tuscaloosa. He said he knew Doyle Lee Hamm — they had lived in the same unit for years. “To hear how they tortured him broke me down,” he wrote. “It shook me up. I closed down in my cell and just laid in the dark.”</p>

<p>All mass crimes in history start with a justification, a necessity rationalization, a sick form of nationalism and racism. This week on Intercepted: The Intercept’s Ryan Devereaux talks about his recent reporting in the border state of Arizona and paints a harrowing picture of the human toll of family separations by ICE. Alice Speri lays out her investigation of sexual abuse by ICE officers and contractors in immigration detention centers. Sohail Daulatzai discusses his new book, “With Stones in Our Hands: Writings on Muslims, Racism, and Empire,” and explains why the film “The Battle of Algiers” is still relevant more than 50 years after its release. The legendary resistance singer Barbara Dane shares stories from her 91 years on earth fighting militarism, racism, and economic injustice. Plus, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen competes on Jeopardy! and we hear a cover of “The Partisan” from composers and musicians Leo Heiblum of Mexico and Tenzin Choegyal of Tibet.</p>

<p>[“Jeopardy” theme song plays.]</p>

<p>Alex Trebek: Good luck players, here we go. Let’s find out about the categories: “It’s Debatable” — certainly is. “The Book of Proverbs,” referring to the Bible. And finally, “Dropping Mad Beats.”</p>

<p>Kristen Welker: Why is the government only releasing images of the boys of the boys who are the being held? Where are the girls? Where are the young toddlers?</p>

<p>AT: Kirstjen.</p>

<p>Kirstjen Nielsen: What is, I don’t know the — I’m not familiar with those particular images. But I will look into that.</p>

<p>Alex Trebek: Nope.</p>

<p>Reporter: So why doesn’t the president pick up the phone and change the policy? He says he hates it.</p>

<p>AT: Kirstjen.</p>

<p>KN: What is — Congress could fix this tomorrow!</p>

<p>AT: And that would be “sucrose.”</p>

<p>Cecilia Vega: Have you heard the audio clip of these children wailing, that just came out today?</p>

<p>AT: Answer there: Daily Double. Kirstjen here in the lead with $2,600, but before I ask you to make your wager, we have a change in scoring to announce that affects Karl. Kirstjen, how much of your $2,600 are you putting at risk?</p>

<p>KN: $12,000. What is, I have not seen, it’s something that came out today, but I have been to detention centers.</p>

<p>AT: No, no, no. Here is the clue, players.</p>

<p>CNN’s Jeff Zeleny: How is this not child abuse?</p>

<p>KN: Be more specific, please?</p>

<p>AT: You have 30 seconds. Good luck. [“Final Jeopardy” music plays.]</p>

<p>KN: What is — there are videos, there is TVs, I’ve visited the detention centers myself.</p>

<p>AT: Kirstjen, why is she looking at me that way? Because she wrote down: “What is: God?” Sorry. That’s incorrect. It’ll cost you.</p>

<p>[Musical interlude.]</p>

<p>Jeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.</p>

<p>[Musical interlude.]</p>

<p>JS: I’m Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City, and this is episode 61 of Intercepted.</p>

<p>Laura Ingraham: Since more illegal immigrants are rushing the border, more kids are being separated from their parents, and temporarily housed in what are essentially summer camps or as The San Diego Union-Tribune described them today, as looking like basically boarding schools.</p>

<p>JS: I want to begin today’s show by reading the testimony of a Red Cross official who visited a site that was described by the authorities as a “shelter for the refugee children.” After visiting the site, this Red Cross official stated the following:</p>

<p>“Not far from the ambulance, from another barracks, the sad cries of the children were heard. There was set, on the bare floor, four hundred children: newborns, children from a few weeks or months, up to ten years of age. How many children came, and where they were dispatched, could no longer be found out. The children in the children’s barracks cried inexorably and were calling their mothers, who were only a few steps away from the children, but the fascist criminals did not let mothers to approach their children.”</p>

<p>Again, this was the Red Cross official’s description of what was called a “shelter for refugee children.” But this so-called shelter was not in the U.S.; it was in fascist Croatia during World War II. In reality, it was not a shelter for refugee children: It was a concentration camp, known as Sisak, and run by Ustaše fascists allied with Hitler. It began with 900 children in 1942, most of them Serbs, and eventually there would be more than 6,600 children that were taken to the camp. Between 1,100 and 1,600 of these children would die there.</p>

<p>The Nazis, too, had concentration camps for children. And, in at least one case, the Nazis manufactured a small village in one of its camps, forcing its prisoners to temporarily convert their hellish gulag into a propaganda site for a visit from the Red Cross.</p>

<p>I bring this up because of the mind-boggling press conference on Monday of the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen when she was confronted with the audio obtained and published by ProPublica on Monday.</p>

<p>[Audio clip of children bawling.]</p>

<p>JS: What we hear on this tape are cries of children in detention, desperate, looking for their parents, promising to behave if they let them see their parents. It’s gut-wrenching and sickening. But Secretary Nielsen assured the press that the conditions in these detention centers for children are actually really good, and she can testify to that because she’s been there.</p>

<p>KN: We can now care for them. We have high standards — we give them meals, we give them education, we give them medical care. There’s videos, there’s TVs, I visited the detention centers myself.</p>

<p>JS: There’s been a lot of discussions lately about comparing the Trump administration’s family separation policy to policies of the Nazis, specifically concentration camps. Some people have objected to such comparisons, saying that they trivialize the mass extermination that took place during the Holocaust. And then, there is this answer from Attorney General Jeff Sessions:</p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions: Well it’s a real exaggeration. Of course, in Nazi Germany, they were keeping the Jews from leaving the country. But this is a serious matter.</p>

<p>JS: There is another quote I want to share with you on this issue. Some say that Jeff Sessions and Stephen Miller are adopting or utilizing Nazi tactics. But listen to what Adolf Hitler wrote about his vision of immigration in “Mein Kampf” in 1925. Hitler writes, and I’m quoting:</p>

<p>“At present, there exists one State which manifests at least some modest attempts that show a better appreciation of how things ought to be done in this matter. It is not, however, in our model German Republic but in the U.S.A. that efforts are made to conform at least partly to the counsels of common sense. By refusing immigrants to enter there if they are in a bad state of health, and by excluding certain races from the right to become naturalized as citizens, they have begun to introduce principles similar to those on which we wish to ground the People’s State.”</p>

<p>That was in 1925, Adolf Hitler saying that he was inspired by the way that the United States was handling immigration.</p>

<p>You see, history and context are vitally important. At the same time, the horrors being meted out by the Trump administration are their own crime. And the racism, the xenophobia, the labeling of undocumented people as “vermin,” the lie from Stephen Miller that forced separation is actually a humanitarian program — all of this deserves to be fought because it is happening and it is happening now. Yes, the tactics, the rhetoric, the white supremacy — all of these are rooted in history. That history includes the Nazis, but it also includes the history of the United States.</p>

<p>All mass crimes throughout history start with a justification, a necessity rationalization, a sick form of nationalism and racism. And also, that notion that we are God’s chosen people and everything we do under our manmade laws is actually divinely blessed and endorsed. We do not know what horrors are gonna come next with this criminal, human rights abusing, child-abuse factory being run by the Trump administration. But history teaches us that now is the time to be vigilant, now is the time to fight, to resist, to stop this before it moves onto its next stage — whatever that may be.</p>

<p>The Intercept’s Ryan Devereaux and Alice Speri on Forced Family Separations by ICE</p>

<p>President Donald J. Trump: When people come up, they have to know they can’t get in. Otherwise, it’s never going to stop. I don’t want people coming in. Do you know, if a person comes in a puts one foot on our ground, it’s essentially, “Welcome to America, welcome to our country.” You never get ’em out.</p>

<p>JS: Joining me now to discuss the Trump administration’s policies and the role of ICE in forcibly separating children from their parents are two of my colleagues, Alice Speri and Ryan Devereaux.</p>

<p>Ryan covers Homeland Security, ICE, and the border for The Intercept. He just returned from one of the front lines of this battle, Arizona.</p>

<p>And Alice has been doing important work on ICE, including a story in April about rampant sexual abuse of people in immigration detention by ICE personnel. Ryan, Alice, welcome back to Intercepted.</p>

<p>Ryan Devereaux: Thanks for having me.</p>

<p>Alice Speri: Thanks for having me.</p>

<p>JS: Ryan, let’s start Ryan just with the bigger picture. Before Trump assumed the presidency, what was the family separation policy or what would happen under Bush or Obama in these kinds of circumstances?</p>

<p>RD: So the most recent history, if you want to go back to the Obama administration, in 2014 there was this so-called surge in Central American unaccompanied minors showing up to the border, family units. In response to that, the Obama administration basically took a position of deterrence, which is sort of an extension of a longstanding U.S. border enforcement strategy, started moving a lot of families into family detention centers or paroling families out into the community, with the expectation that they would, you know, return for meetings with immigration officials. And a lot of these family detention centers, a lot of reporting in lawsuits revealed, were pretty poorly run places and pretty dark. By no means was the Obama administration’s record with the way they handled families exemplary.</p>

<p>But, the difference between what the Obama administration did and what the Trump Administration did is that when unaccompanied minors would come in under the Obama administration, they were unaccompanied because they came in by themselves. Under the Trump administration, the government is creating unaccompanied minors and that is the major difference in what we’re seeing right now.</p>

<p>JS: Hm.</p>

<p>RD: I look at this situation as a continuation of a long historical trajectory of immigration enforcement in this country that’s sort of been passed down through multiple generations. You go back to the Clinton administration: In the mid-90s, a bunch of Border Patrol chiefs and planners within the Pentagon got together and they drew up a plan for how to do enforcement on the border — it was called prevention through deterrence. The idea was you would funnel migration flows out of the border city areas and into more remote regions where enforcement would be easier. And that kind of has been the guiding strategy for the last two decades.</p>

<p>But as this is happening, on the right, on the far, nativist right, you had a sort of hardening of anger and resentment and frustration, and this ran through the immigration enforcement agencies — ICE, Border Patrol, all of these guys. It was expressed through Breitbart. You had Jeff Sessions, then a senator, now our Attorney General, with his young aide Stephen Miller, they saw that there was this anger, this deep, deep anger in America at immigrants and in some of the law enforcement agencies that felt like what the Obama administration was doing was incentivizing people to come here. We know that that’s not supported by the facts. People are coming here from Central America because Central America has become, after, decades of U.S. interference, one of the most dangerous places in the world to live. People are fleeing extreme violence. That hasn’t figured into the calculus of the far right.</p>

<p>And so what they’re doing right now is: This is their fight. I mean, this is the way Stephen Miller is describing it right now. This summer is their fight.</p>

<p>JS: There was this situation where the New York Times interviewed Stephen Miller and they recorded it and they wanted to air that on their podcast, “The Daily”:</p>

<p>Michael Barbaro: We were going to hear that audio on the show today.</p>

<p>Julie Hirschfeld Davis: Right. We were, until I heard from the White House earlier today that they were not at all comfortable with us using that audio because we didn’t talk about any sort of alternative uses for the interview. And when they found out that his voice was actually going to be on a podcast discussing this, they were not happy about it. So, they asked us not to use it.</p>

<p>JS: And I listened to the episode, and what the Times’ position seems to be is that the Trump administration asked them not to use the audio and they complied. I mean, this was an on-the-record interview. But what Stephen Miller argued in that interview with The Times was that this is, in fact, a humanitarian policy.</p>

<p>You also had Jeff Sessions essentially imply that this policy is divined from our Lord and Savior.</p>

<p>Jeff Sessions: If you violate the law, you subject yourself to prosecution. I would cite you to the Apostle Paul and his clear and wise command in Romans 13 to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the government for his purposes.</p>

<p>JS: And then we had this insane press conference with the Homeland Security Director Kirstjen Nielsen on Monday. Talk about all of those responses and events, Alice.</p>

<p>AS: Yeah, where to start. I mean, I think first of all it’s important to remember that a lot of what is happening is not the whims of Trump, who’s crazy and he woke up this morning thinking: I’m going to do this — even though he does actually have the power to end it. I think one of the lines that the administration is pushing out over and over is like, “we’re just enforcing a law. There’s nothing we can do.” This was a crisis that was created by their decisions and by their policies. What is happening is that Trump promised his voters that he was going to build this wall, has failed to deliver on that and so he’s now trying to force immigration reform of whatever kind by hijacking causes and people and, in this case, hijacking children. He went for teenagers and youth first, and now he’s going for children.</p>

<p>So, fast forward that to Monday, we had, I think, possibly the most incredible White House press briefing I have seen under this administration. First of all, this press briefing —</p>

<p>JS: Which is saying something!</p>

<p>AS: It definitely says something. We have very low standards.</p>

<p>The press briefing was scheduled for 1 PM. It didn’t happen until 5 PM. Secretary Nielsen was in New Orleans where she gave an address, talking about all this stuff, to a very friendly audience, right? The National Sheriff’s Association and reports say that Huckabee Sanders, the press secretary, actually refused to face reporters on her own after, you know, being pressed on these very issues in the past weeks, and she’s had some really tense exchanges with reporters about this very issue.</p>

<p>Brian Karem: Don’t you have any empathy for what these people are going through? They have less than you do.</p>

<p>Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders: Brian — God! Settle down.</p>

<p>BK: Sarah, come on. Seriously? Seriously.</p>

<p>SHS: I’m trying to be serious, but I’m not going to have you yell out of turn. Jill, please —</p>

<p>BK: — it’s a law, and they have, these people have nothing.</p>

<p>SHS: Hey, Brian, I know you want to get some more TV time, but that’s not what this is about. I want to recognize you —</p>

<p>BK: It’s not about that. It’s about answering the questions, Sarah.</p>

<p>SHS: — go ahead, Jill.</p>

<p>BK: Honestly, answer the question. It’s a serious question. These people have nothing, they come to the border with nothing, and you throw children in cages. You’re a parent. You’re a parent of young children! Don’t you have any empathy for what they go through?</p>

<p>SHS: Jill, go ahead —</p>

<p>AS: So ProPublica actually dropped this incredible, heartbreaking, devastating recording just as the White House was pushing its briefing.</p>

<p>Cecilia Vega: Have you heard the audio clip of these children wailing that just came out today?</p>

<p>KN: I have, I have not seen — it’s something that came out today.</p>

<p>AS: When they finally started it, Secretary Nielsen got on stage and said she hadn’t heard it, which is a lie, the first of many lies she just, like, pushed through in this press briefing. They had just spent hours trying to come up with a response to this. There were actually reporters in the room that were playing the audio during this press conference, which was extremely chaotic and just very emotional and intense.</p>

<p>But to talk about what Nielsen said: She lied about not having seen images of kids in cages. She lied about not having heard this recording. She lied about the administration not been able to do anything about this. She lied about this being the law. This is not the law. This is a policy of the Trump Administration. She looked at the camera and said:</p>

<p>KN: We have high standards, we give them meals, we give them education, we give them medical care. There’s videos; there’s TVs. I visited the detention centers myself —</p>

<p>AS: Which is, again, a blatant lie. We just at The Intercept have done this story just a couple months ago on massive sexual assault and rampant abuse that happens it an immigration detention centers. We exposed more than 1,200 complaints of sexual assault happening in detention centers, and we know that’s just a tiny slice of what is happening out there.</p>

<p>JS: And that was between 2010 and 2017.</p>

<p>AS: That was between 2010 and 2017, and I’m happy to go into a little bit more of that report. Some of the things we found as part of that story: The fact that more than half of the alleged perpetrators of sexual abuse in immigration detention centers were ICE agents or private contractors working for ICE; an extraordinary high number of ICE officers witnessed the abuse and did nothing to end it. So, this is really rampant abuse that’s been going on for years that definitely hasn’t started under the Trump Administration by no means. But to go up and say: These kids are being well taken care off and ICE is perfectly capable of protecting the safety and well-being of the people it detains, and we have the highest detention standards — that is one of the most extraordinary lies that we heard yesterday. And we heard many.</p>

<p>JS: Ryan, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon tweeted this week that he had met with a man in immigration detention whose 18-month-old child, he doesn’t know the whereabouts of.</p>

<p>Explain why there are children so young — 56 weeks, 18 months — like, how did they end up here and why are they separated from their parents?</p>

<p>RD: Well, we just got a little bit of insight into that in a call that DHS, including some Border Patrol officials, had with reporters just before I walked in here. And what it sounds like is in the individual Border Patrol stations along the border, chiefs have discretion in terms of directing their personnel and how to deal with so-called sensitive populations, including little kids.</p>

<p>JS: You’re saying that there isn’t a blanket policy; it’s at the discretion of individual chiefs of mission in those areas.</p>

<p>RD: Exactly. Chiefs of station along the border are coming up with the protocol for how to deal with these kids.</p>

<p>And I spoke to a veteran childcare provider who has worked on these issues for 40 years yesterday, whose organization contracts with ORR, the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes in a lot of these young people, and she said this is something that she’s been seeing and something that she’s been concerned about. The Border Patrol agents on the ground seem to have a lot of leeway in terms of deciding what happens to the families that they separate. She described the case of a little boy whose father was taken from him, handcuffed in front of him, terrified the kid because he’s running from a country where people with badges and guns and uniforms really are the bad guys. And she said, as far as she can tell, what happened in this situation is that they grabbed the kid, grabbed the dad and they just decided: No, he doesn’t have a credible asylum claim and they quickly moved him out of the country.</p>

<p>I mean, we’re seeing a lot of that. The government is deporting parents before these organizations that weren’t consulted before this was implemented even have a chance to start the process of reunification. So they, there’s parents gone in countries, there are kids — I mean, little kids, I’m talking about a six-year-old blind girl separated from her, mother pre-verbal kids, nonverbal kids, indigenous kids — who suddenly are on their own track, legally, within the system, who are completely overwhelmed and terrified. And they’re basically being asked to navigate their own case as their parents disappear.</p>

<p>The government, their solution to this right now is a 1-800 number that’s given to parents that they’re supposed to call. But a lot of these parents don’t have access to a phone in these detention centers. Sometimes it takes weeks before the childcare provider organizations can locate the parents, or, like I said, sometimes they’re already gone. Some parents are asking to, you know, after their criminal case is settled, a lot of these people get time served — that’s another thing to remember, we’re talking about a misdemeanor. They’re separating families, they’re taking away kids, they’re throwing them into a labyrinth of a broken bureaucracy over a misdemeanor.</p>

<p>JS: Alice, The Intercept published an article on June 16 by Debbie Nathan, who has for decades been on the front lines on the Texas-Mexico border really reporting about the evolution of this policy and the fate of various migrants to the United States for different reasons. And her piece was titled: “Desperate Asylum-Seekers Are Being Turned Away By U.S. Border Agents Claiming There’s ‘No Room.'”</p>

<p>Talk about what this piece argues and reports.</p>

<p>AS: Yes, first of all, the thing to say, in case people don’t know, is that turning away asylum-seekers violates U.S. law and international law. So the U.S. government is breaking the law here, and has been doing that for a number of years.</p>

<p>There was a lawsuit that was filed a couple years ago in response to some of these incidents, and that’s ongoing. What we are seeing now is an uptick in these cases that appear to be mandated from above. There’s no real sense that it’s true that there’s no room, and even if there were no room, that is still the law and you still have to admit asylum-seekers.</p>

<p>But I actually think one of the most fascinating stuff aspects of Debbie Nathan’s story, and I really encourage everybody to read it, is: I think a lot of people right now are feeling extremely overwhelmed and angry. And a lot of people are trying to figure out: What is it that they can do, and you know, you can call your Representatives and you can march and rally and protest and you can go on social media and sort of pour your anger out there. But you can also — and this is what Debbie and others have been doing — go on the other side of the border and help people cross. And as Debbie Nathan’s story shows, once you have a reporter, a human rights worker or anybody with a U.S. passport and a phone recording the incident, so you have people walk through border, there’s this imaginary line on a bridge. And you know what we’ve heard is — what we’ve seen is — Border Patrol agents will kind of like, stand there as guards and try to dissuade people from entering. They can’t actually do that.</p>

<p>And so, if you have somebody who comes in with American privilege and helps those people cross, they can’t stop them. I mean it’s really quite incredible that it’s come down to this, but I actually would really love to see more people that live down by the border do that.</p>

<p>JS: Ryan, you’ve just got back from reporting, also, on one of the front lines of this. Describe where you were and what it was like.</p>

<p>RD: Yeah, so I was down in Arizona, in the Sonoran Desert, which has been sort of the epicenter of a lot of immigration enforcement for the last decade and a half. This is a place where migrants have died by the thousands as a result of U.S. policy that drives people into the desert. And, you know, I was down there looking into what comes next? What’s the process of reunification? How does this feel for the people who have spent years working on these cases? And, I mean, to a person, their response is that this horrifying; they’ve never seen anything like it.</p>

<p>I don’t think that that’s an overstatement at all. We’re talking about really little kids. I mean, the government claimed recently that they’re not taking babies, and that’s just not true. And I think we’re only starting to see the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>I mean, if you think about the rates at which we’re separating people — which is several hundred a week, 658 over two weeks, in the two weeks following Sessions’ order, according to DHS — if we continue at that rate, we could be pushing 10,000 cases by the end of the summer.</p>

<p>JS: And some of your reporting, that’s going to be published soon, that you shared with me, indicated that last week the U.S. government said it had separated 1,995 children from their parents from April through May. And then your reporting indicates earlier this month, The Intercept reported a minimum of 1,358 children were separated from their parents from October 2017 through mid-May.</p>

<p>RD: We had 2,235 families, comprised of 4,538 people apprehended on the Southwest border. “Children,” I’m quoting here, “children made AUCs through this prosecution initiative” was 2,342 – 2,342 kids made unaccompanied by the state, over this period from May to June. With 2,206 adults referred for prosecution.</p>

<p>Now, if you look at the apprehension numbers, the adult apprehension numbers and the referrals, we’re at about 20 percent into 100 percent of zero tolerance, right? Like, we’re a fifth of the way there. And the Border Patrol is talking about cranking this up by several orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>So the scale is kind of impossible to wrap your head around. And when you think about the kinds of — when you think about how this was already a system that was nearly broken in terms of dealing with unaccompanied kids, and adding that influx of, now, young kids? Because a lot of these people that work with unaccompanied minors are normally working with teenagers, who really were literally unaccompanied when they came to the border, not little kids whose parents had a plan, who are now made unaccompanied. How we’re going to handle this? Like, even if it stopped tomorrow, what are we going to do with all those cases? It’s really hard for me to imagine that ICE is going to back some aggressive initiative to make sure that these kids find their families again? I just don’t think so. People are going to fall through the cracks.</p>

<p>We have armed government agents systematically separating little kids from their parents and plunging them into an entirely broken system with no path forward as to how to reunite them with their parents.</p>

<p>JS: Alice, I’ll give you the last word.</p>

<p>AS: I mean, I don’t even know where to start. I mean, all that Ryan said. There’s — I think we should do it all. Right? Protest, rally, call Representatives, vote. I mean, obviously vote, the midterms are coming up and that’s going to be important. But then there’s so much more, and I think, honestly, in the immediate, I already said earlier, I think what people should do is go out to the border and help people cross, legally, at ports of entry.</p>

<p>I would like to one day look back at the ProPublica audio and say that this was a turning point. Because, up until now, we’ve heard all the stories, we’ve heard from the parents, we didn’t really hear the children. I don’t know what else it’s going to take to get people up and doing something about this. But I hope one day we’ll look at this as where it took a turn.</p>

<p>JS: Well, Ryan Devereaux and Alice Speri, you both have been doing some of the best reporting on ICE. And Ryan, also, thank you for your incredible work down there and your dedication to this story, reporting from the front lines. Ryan Devereaux, thanks for being with us.</p>

<p>RD: Thanks for having me.</p>

<p>JS: Alice Speri, thank you ask well.</p>

<p>AS: Thank you.</p>

<p>JS: Ryan Devereaux and Alice Speri are reporters for The Intercept. You can check out their important journalism at theintercept.com.</p>

<p>JS: That is the great Mexican composer and musician Leo Heiblum and the equally celebrated composer and singer Tenzin Choegyal performing their own version of Leonard Cohen’s “The Partisan,” right here in the Intercepted studio.</p>

<p>Sohail Daulatzai Discusses His New Book, “With Stones in Our Hands: Writings on Muslims, Racism, and Empire”</p>

<p>You might not know it from watching the news these days, but the U.S. is engaged in multiple wars across the world, both declared and undeclared. The so-called targeted killing program continues unabated under Donald Trump, and the civilian death toll has been skyrocketing over the past year in Syria and Iraq. Trump famously tore up the Iran nuclear deal, and he has conspired with Israel, the Saudis and the United Arab Emirates to lay the groundwork for regime change in Iran. The scorched earth bombing of Yemen is nothing short of a genocidal massacre — one that is aided, funded, supported, armed by the United States. The U.S. also continues to conduct drone strikes in Yemen, as the Saudis pummel the poorest country in the Arab world nonstop. The war in Afghanistan is still on and drone strikes are reemerging in Pakistan.</p>

<p>In Iraq, recent parliamentary elections saw the fiery nationalist, Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr’s bloc win more seats than any other party. And there is talk of building a coalition with the once-banned and persecuted Iraqi communist party. Sadr and his Mahdi Army were one of the fiercest forces fighting the U.S. occupation and it represents a major rejection of the American project in Iraq.</p>

<p>In the midst of all of this, we also have Trump’s Muslim ban being challenged in courts; open anti-Muslim rhetoric emanating from the most prominent political offices in the land.</p>

<p>There is a great new collection of essays out that tackles a whole range of issues relating to Islam and Muslims, wars, the Palestinian struggle, women’s rights, state terror, drone strikes, 9/11, civil liberties, white supremacy, and on and on. The book is called “With Stones in Our Hands: Writings on Muslims, Racism and Empire” and it is edited by Sohail Daulatzai and Junaid Rana.</p>

<p>We are joined now by Sohail. He teaches in Film and Media Studies, African American Studies, and Global Middle East Studies at the University of California, Irvine. He is also the author of several other books, including “Fifty Years of ‘The Battle of Algiers': Past as Prologue.” He is the curator of the celebrated exhibit Return of the Mecca.</p>

<p>Sohail Daulatzai, welcome to Intercepted.</p>

<p>Sohail Daulatzai: Thanks for having me.</p>

<p>JS: One of your theses in that opening essay that you wrote I found really interesting and provocative, because you’re arguing that all the discussion about radicalization, self-radicalization, post-9/11 is rooted in a much longer history and wasn’t just born of 9/11, Guantanamo torture.</p>

<p>So, lay out your argument that you’re making about where radicalization comes from.</p>

<p>SD: For us, writing this book was important for several reasons, to try and get at what we felt were some really frustrating turns of events, particularly post-9/11. We wanted to really, center because of the kind of presence of the United States and the way in which it came to form itself through native genocide and black enslavement, but also how it expanded and kind of supplanted Europe as a world hegemon in the global leviathan. We wanted to really think about: How is white supremacy operating in the current moment?</p>

<p>And for us, when it came to thinking about like, the figure of the Muslim, and I say the figure of the Muslim, and I’ll probably refer to it throughout the conversation, we’re not only talking about Muslims per se, and we’re not even talking about believers per se, we’re talking about those who might be deemed Muslim or who look Muslim. In fact, you know, as we know, the first person that was killed after 9/11 in Arizona was a Sikh convenience store owner who was confused or thought to be Muslim, right?</p>

<p>JS: And you also had the case of the Sikh temple being shot up in my hometown of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and we understand that shooter also thought he was attacking a mosque and killing Muslims.</p>

<p>SD: Right. Absolutely.</p>

<p>So, this idea of the Muslim or the figure of the Muslim is about a particular look. It’s not a phenotype in terms of skin, but there is skin, and a certain kind of appearance that goes along with how race is operating.</p>

<p>And so for us it was important to kind of like put our finger on that and try to think about how the figure of the Muslim is shaping kind of post-9/11 security discourse and the war on terror, in particular.</p>

<p>One of the ways, as you mentioned in your question, is the idea of radicalism or radicalization. This is the starting point for many people when they want to think about Islam or Muslims. Obviously, the right has a response to this question, which is: Ban Muslims, don’t allow them in the country. For liberals and maybe even some on the left, the argument is: Well, not all Muslims are terrorists. It’s that argument, and maybe we can unpack that a little bit. They’re willing to accept certain kinds of Muslims. You know, witness Hillary Clinton and the Khizr Khan family, where their son is willing to pick up a gun and go kill for America. That’s an acceptable kind of Muslim to the United States, in some ways. Or one that, in some ways, assumes or doesn’t question, you know, American patriotism, its role in the world and the benevolence of the United States historically or today. Those are the kinds of Muslims that are deemed acceptable to kind of fulfill this kind of multicultural project, right?</p>

<p>JS: Well and every time you see someone plow a vehicle into a crowd of others or a shooting takes place and the shooter turns out to be a Muslim, as in San Bernardino, California, what you’ll see on social media, and I see this with a lot of Muslim friends of mine, there’s this expectation that A. they have to have a comment on it, and B. that that comment needs to clarify these people don’t represent the real Islam or these people don’t speak for true American Muslims.</p>

<p>SD: Right. Right. Absolutely. And this is part of what, in some of my current work, like looking at how the language of terrorism or antiterrorism is really racially coded language, right? In many ways, the language of terrorism or the terrorist really is a 21st century way of marking the savage, the civilization/savagery binary. It’s about excommunicating particular individuals, groups of people or even ideas outside of the community of the human, the human family. And therefore they’re seen as a threat to the human community and need to be obliterated or dealt with.</p>

<p>And so, what we have when it comes to post-9/11 conversations and discourse is you have the bad apples theory, when something like that happens. You have Muslims or their allies come to the rescue and say, “Well, hey, you know, not all Muslims are bad. There’s only a few bad apples.”</p>

<p>The other argument you get commonly is, especially when a white person shoots up a school or a concert or any number of things that takes place, where, on a mass level, it’s, we’ll see, “white people are terrorists, too.” Right? This is called terrorism.</p>

<p>And for me, those are both problematic, but they both play into kind of like the security apparatus or the security regime post-9/11. One, the bad apples theory doesn’t account for how racial profiling works. In order to grab the bad apples, you’ve got to racially profile the whole group. So, so you’re kind of reproducing the very thing you claim to be challenging, when you say not all Muslims are bad. In order to catch those bad ones, you gotta profile all Muslims.</p>

<p>The second one, where whites are terrorists too, it normalizes the idea that terrorism is a category that needs to be cracked down on. And that it gives sanction and legitimacy to the state to do so. Right?</p>

<p>JS: Well, it’s borne of the same mentality of the phrase “white trash,” in a sense, because what does that mean that everyone else is if these people have now become trash? What you’re essentially saying —</p>

<p>SD: Right. Right.</p>

<p>JS: — is people of color are trash.</p>

<p>SD: Are trash. Right.</p>

<p>JS: And these ones just happen to be white, but they need to have a separate category.</p>

<p>SD: And even if we accepted the idea that white people can be terrorists, too, just like on the war on crime, white people committed crimes in bigger numbers than black or brown communities, but when it came to the War on Crime, who was policed heavier? Who was surveilled more, right? How did an urban police state come to be created, right?</p>

<p>JS: Well, I’m talking to you in New York right now, our stop and frisk thing was like 90 percent people of color getting stopped and frisked.</p>

<p>SD: Absolutely. So even if you accept that white people are terrorists, too, it’s going to still fall on black and brown communities to be heavily policed, right, because of that. And so I think the language of anti-terrorism is really problematic for those reasons, and more importantly, I think it also fractures solidarities, because then when you can label like, those fighting for Palestinian self-determination as terrorists, but then you can say, well, the Ku Klux Klan are terrorists, too.</p>

<p>And then for those people who don’t necessarily understand Palestine, but have a relationship or understanding of what the KKK is, and then they see that those fighting for Palestinian self-determination and the Klan are both terrorists, it kind of prevents them from creating a certain kind of solidarity. So, I think it’s important for us to be critical of that language of terrorism because I think it’s racially coded.</p>

<p>JS: Let me share with people an observation that I really found interesting from the latest book, and this is from the essay that you and Junaid write at the beginning: “Considering the current historical moment, in which the war on terror has expanded and intensified, this project seeks to center the United States as the dominant site of racialization around the figure of the Muslim in its current logic of empire and the ongoing war on terror, and, in doing so, we seek to interrogate and challenge the master narrative of exceptionalism that imagines the United States in what Thomas Jefferson named an empire of Liberty, a legitimizing discourse used to construct colorblind multiculturalism.”</p>

<p>SD: Right, exactly. Yeah, I mean I think what we were trying to suggest there is that, you know, the United States doesn’t see itself, this is what American exceptionalism, part of what it does, it says: We’re different than Europe, we’re not like the old royal monarchs and we’re not like those old colonial empires. We’re something different. America’s always thought about itself, even from the Jeffersonian ideal as something different: We’re an empire of liberty, we spread liberty around the world. Right?</p>

<p>And so, it sought to fracture itself from the history of European colonization and said that we don’t colonize, we don’t have an imperial footprint, we are not an empire. Right? It was very difficult for America to contend with that question of European Empire because it itself was birthed out of it.</p>

<p>In making that claim that we are an empire of liberty, what has kind of been birth by that idea is this notion that multiculturalism and diversity are what America should celebrate and what it shares is distinct from the rest of the world. In fact, America argues that in many ways the implicit assumption is that people from all over the world come to America; the United States, therefore is a microcosm of the world and therefore it stands in for the world. And so that idea of multiculturalism has been central to the United States in terms of, like, it thinking about itself globally. It markets itself as this diverse multicultural landscape and I think in the post-9/11 context, you know, I think we give language to a term called imperial multiculturalism. Right, how is multiculturalism being weaponized in a particular way?</p>

<p>And there’s a lot of faults with multiculturalism, right?</p>

<p>JS: Nikhil Pal Singh, who we had on this show, also, I think he put it sort of the multiculturalization of imperialism that you can have Obama as one of the best modern examples, was an imperial president who operated a global kill list, and used his legitimacy as the first black president and a constitutional law scholar to sell the idea of borderless war.</p>

<p>SD: Right.</p>

<p>JS: And his bottom line on some of these questions that you’re discussing was: Yes, we kill civilians, but we regret when we kill civilians and we don’t intend to kill civilians and that’s what differentiates us from our enemies in the Middle East.</p>

<p>SD: Right. And I think Obama in many ways, and this is part of what we wanted to respond to, and that’s why chasing this moving target becomes difficult. It’s almost too easy to point to Trump as an exemplar of this kind of anti-Muslim racism.</p>

<p>In fact, you know this well through your own work, Obama had dropped more drone bombs than Bush before him, so Obama came to kind of symbolize a particular kind of multicultural ideal.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget that, you know, there was all this question of Barack Hussein Obama being Muslim.</p>

<p>JS: Oh, yeah. Yeah! And he’s still viewed as the first Muslim president on Fox News.</p>

<p>SD: Exactly. And so there’s even that specter of the Muslim was even haunting Obama’s presidency as well. And I don’t remember a time where he actually came out and said, “Well, so what if I was?” All he said was, “No, I’m not.”</p>

<p>JS: And remember when John McCain was running against Obama, it was in, again, somehow Wisconsin comes up, but it was in Waukesha, Wisconsin, which is a pretty right-wing part of the state of Wisconsin. John McCain was confronted at an event by a woman who was stating that Obama was a Muslim.</p>

<p>Audience Member: I gotta ask you a question. I do not believe in, I can’t trust Obama. I have read about him, and he’s not, he’s not — he’s an Arab. He’s not —</p>

<p>JS: And McCain’s response to that was:</p>

<p>Senator John McCain: No ma’am, no ma’am. He’s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues. And that’s what this campaign is all about. He’s not. Thank you. [Scattered applause.]</p>

<p>JS: To me, it was one of the best examples of what you’re saying. That it’s like, “Oh, no, no, no. He’s a good guy. He’s a real American. He’s not a Muslim American.”</p>

<p>SD: Right. Absolutely. It’s like, how has the Muslim become kind of the limit of what’s politically possible? It’s almost like the Muslim is the limit or the test case. You know, you hear this all the time, like a reference point for the Republican Party gone wrong, if you want to put it in those terms, that’s the American Taliban, that’s the ISIS of the Republican Party, right? The kind of draconian, you know, right-wing evangelical crowd — the language of Taliban and ISIS are used to describe them. As if, like, being Muslim, or a particular kind of Muslim, is the lowest form of humanity one can be. Like this is how far the Republican Party has gone that they’re like the Taliban now.</p>

<p>And so I think the Muslim stands in, in many ways as the limit of the political. Right? Like, when it comes to the question of women’s rights, it’s like: We do feminism, but we don’t want to be like those Muslims. Right? When it comes to queer and minority rights, same idea. Even the question of armed struggle or political violence, the figure of the Muslim where Muslims seem to embody the excess of political violence so that Muslims become the limit of what’s politically possible, right? That’s where politics stops and something else begins. When Muslims do what other people do, it’s somehow qualitatively different and more of a threat or more of a danger.</p>

<p>This why Bill Maher and Sam Harris can say: Hey, OK, we’re atheists. And that’s fine! You can be an atheist. But why is it somehow that Islam is the worst kind of religion?</p>

<p>JS: Well, because they do not criticize all religions equally. Islam holds this spot, and then it’s like miles below, you find number two in their crosshairs, but they’re obsessed with Islam.</p>

<p>SD: Right. And people have talked about this, like, we can sit here and critique, like, the way in which religions have become politicized and have been used in different moments in history, and many people, post-9/11, they talk about the dangers of political Islam.</p>

<p>But we don’t ask: What about political secularism? Like, what did that create with native genocide, enslavement and mass plunder across the globe, in the name of secularism? Like, we don’t ask those kinds of questions, right?</p>

<p>Somehow the idea of religion is separate from the running of state and its policies, and then even when it is separated, the religion of Islam is somehow deemed the worst or the most excessive or the most violent, right? And so that when it comes to the question of women and questions of feminism, like, how has the discourse of the veil come to stand in for repression or oppression and excess, and that somehow the veil needs to be taken off and they need to be modernized. And that’s an old colonial fantasy. I mean, the French in Algeria used to have public unveiling spectacles for people, right? Showing Muslim women taking off their veil, because now they’re modernized, right?</p>

<p>Ultimately, like, we’re talking about patriarchy as a global phenomenon. It’s not exclusive or endemic to one group of people or one part of the world, but often when it comes to talking about Islam, somehow it’s those people that carry on the worst kinds of patriarchy and whether it takes place in other religious communities or other forms of oppression around women, whether it be sexual violence, rape and what the #MeToo movement is revealing is how permanent this is as a fixture in American life, right? That forms of patriarchy exist everywhere and they need to be challenged everywhere as a result.</p>

<p>JS: What do you make of the language that is used by, it’s not exclusive to this administration, but when you have someone like Jeff Sessions so overtly speaking in a Christian supremacist type of a manner — yes, Bush called this a crusade at the beginning. You know, if you watch Bush on Islam, I mean it’s like night and day from now.</p>

<p>SD: Right. Right.</p>

<p>President George W. Bush: The face of terror is not the true face of Islam. That’s not what Islam was all about. Islam is peace.</p>

<p>JS: But what do you make of — you know, Sessions talks about the Anglo-American heritage of law enforcement. He recently said that these forced separations of the family basically is divine intervention from God to bless the laws of this country, even if it means separating kids.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of, what I think you would call Islamo-fascist if you were on the right, if it was a Muslim. But it’s a form of theocracy that is being articulated by these guys in defense of something that has very little to do with religion at all; it’s political-power grabbing and white supremacy.</p>

<p>SD: The fallacy of a secular logic was something that we wanted to kind of point out. That never has secularism actually existed. That the West is in many ways founded upon the notion of Christian ethics — the individual and sacrifice — right? And those have been woven through how citizenship and those questions get expressed.</p>

<p>What we’ve had at different moments in time, and you’re pointing out what Sessions is saying, are particularly more visible versions of how then the religious undertones of government come to the fore and get articulated.</p>

<p>And clearly they’re playing to their base, right? Clearly they’re playing to their base and they’re playing to this idea of a kind of civilizational war. I don’t think it’s too much of a stretch to say that what Sessions and them are appealing to is a particularly idea of a kind of civilizational war of Judeo-Christianity against the rest of the world, right?</p>

<p>And, yes, is religion being instrumentalized in this particular instance? Absolutely. We know that the United States has a deep history of separating children from their parents: from natives, indigenous folks, to black people and slavery. Right? Like, that history is something that’s endemic to America. It’s not exceptional. And you hear that response, like, what the United States is doing at the border, that’s just not American. It’s like, “Well, you don’t know the history, if that’s what you’re going to claim, right?”</p>

<p>And I think there’s something about the Trump administration that lays bare the truth of what the U.S. political state is really about.</p>

<p>JS: You’ve written a book about the importance of the film “The Battle of Algiers,” which of course dealt with French imperialism and the uprising in Algeria against French colonialism, and I think it should be required viewing for everyone. And I said that a lot when I was reporting on drone strikes around the world.</p>

<p>[Short scene from “The Battle of Algiers” plays.]</p>

<p>JS: For a new generation of young people who maybe haven’t seen it, what’s your case for why it matters to them now?</p>

<p>SD: I open the book by saying: The Battle of Algiers is still being waged, only now on a planetary scale. Right? That the hunt for Ali la Pointe is still on; the figure of the Muslim still structures global relationships today.</p>

<p>But when it comes to a lot of young people watching “The Battle of Algiers,” you’re right, they don’t necessarily know about it in the way that many did, right? This became the kind of touchstone for thinking about radical politics and cinema and that convergence. But as I talk about in the book, it was also a tool used by the right wing, and, in fact, it’s required viewing in the Pentagon now, in military training schools in the United States.</p>

<p>JS: Oh, Stanley McChrystal, the former commander of the Joint Special Operations Command said when they were preparing to go to Iraq, he had his men watch “The Battle of Algiers.”</p>

<p>SD: So, I talk about how the film got re-appropriated in the post-9/11 context as a way to do counterinsurgency, as opposed to a film that was about a people fighting for dignity and resisting a colonial occupation, right? So I talked about how history, through the Battle of Algiers in many ways, got recuperated or re-appropriated for the interest of imperialism, right?</p>

<p>The film will remain relevant as long as the conditions that necessitated the making of it continue to persist. So as long as there’s Gaza, as long as there’s Iraq, as long as there’s Ferguson, as long as there’s Compton, like the Battle of Algiers is going to remain a relevant film, because it’s a film that does, in a very poetic way, it gives dignity to people’s resistance to these everyday structural forces.</p>

<p>JS: The latest book is separated into four categories if I recall correctly. And the last is “Possible Futures: Descent and the Protest Tradition.” What do you see as the future and protest tradition carrying on?</p>

<p>SD: We’re trying to think about how have past protests traditions, different ways of thinking about politics, how can they be useful for us moving forward and creating radical futures that will help challenge the kind of conditions that many of us find ourselves in. What we’re finding, which is kind of heartwarming in many ways, is a lot of people are hungry for this right now. I mean I think that’s one thing that maybe Trump did that’s maybe different than maybe what Obama and Bush before him, and I think in many ways Obama was a kind of calming salve with the dissent, one thing Trump did was really stoke the fires. And so people are really hungry, especially young people, for thinking about how do we move forward now, and what we tried to do was provide a kind of way of looking back as a way to then chart a course forward?</p>

<p>Well, it’s a really important collection, and I think also people will learn of new voices that they can also check out the other work of. So, Sohail Daulatzai, thank you so much for being with us on Intercepted.</p>

<p>SD: Thanks for having me.</p>

<p>JS: Sohail Daulatzai is the editor, with Junaid Rana, of the new book “With Stones in Our Hands.” He also teaches at the University of California, Irvine.</p>

<p>Legendary Resistance Singer Barbara Dane Shares Stories of Fighting Militarism, Racism, and Economic Injustice</p>

<p>JS: My next guest is a legend in the field of resistance music and an incredible trailblazer in fusing traditional folk music with jazz and blues. She has used her remarkable voice to sings songs with Pete Seeger on picket lines fighting for workers rights:</p>

<p>Barbara Dane: [singing with Pete Seeger] Solidarity forever, solidarity forever, solidarity forever, for a union we are strong.</p>

<p>JS: She has used her voice to fight for racial equality and economic justice:</p>

<p>BD: [Singing] I’ve been travelin’ on the road to freedom. I’ve been lookin’ for the road to freedom, I’ve been travelin’ to the road to freedom. And I’ve been travelin’ on.</p>

<p>JS: She has traveled to coffee shops near army bases around the country and around the world, singing GI resistance songs:</p>

<p>BD: [Singing] If you love your Uncle Sam, bring ’em home, bring ’em home. Stop the war in Vietnam, bring ’em home, bring ’em home; 45,000 dead and gone, bring ’em home, bring ’em home. Uncle Sam is in the wrong, bring ’em home, bring ’em home. We want to end the war right now, bring ’em home, bring ’em home. Don’t take a genius to figure out how, just bring ’em home, bring ’em home. Let ’em fly, let ’em float —</p>

<p>JS: This legendary voice is, of course, that of the great Barbara Dane. She has lent her voice to resistance movements around the world for nearly all of her 91 years on earth.</p>

<p>And she is still going — touring, adapting songs to address the issues right now, the issues of today. She is going to be performing on June 21 at Joe’s Pub, in New York, and she joins me now to talk about her life’s work and how she keeps on keepin’ on.</p>

<p>Barbara Dane, it’s an honor to have you here. Welcome to Intercepted.</p>

<p>Barbara Dane: Jeremy Scahill, I am flabbergasted to be sitting right across from you.</p>

<p>JS: I wanted to ask you, the Smithsonian Folkways recordings this year released “Hot Jazz, Cool Blues &amp; Hard-Hitting Songs” and it’s a retrospective of 60 years of music?</p>

<p>BD: Well, the first time I recorded in a studio was ’57.</p>

<p>JS: So you were like 30 when you first recorded in a studio. What had you been doing before that?</p>

<p>BD: Well, like always singing. Just singing. I always sang because of: who’s in front of me, what do they need? We’re at a picket line, you got to get people together, you got to make people feel good and get to make them feel energetic and positive, and actually the fact of making the record, that first one, I was a kind of phenomena, right? Thinking nobody was singing the old classic blues, Bessie Smith.</p>

<p>[“Do Your Duty” by Bessie Smith plays.]</p>

<p>BD: And Ma Rainey.</p>

<p>[Ma Rainey plays.]</p>

<p>BD: Ida Cox</p>

<p>[“Hard Time Blues” By Ida Cox plays.]</p>

<p>BD: Great women who took the blues from the back porch to the stage. The reason that I jumped to that was that I had a problem with the folk music scene.</p>

<p>JS: What was the folk music scene like? Presumably, you’re talking about the 40s, 50s at the time?</p>

<p>BD: Yeah, right after World War II, you know, Pete Seeger got the idea, when he got out of the service he got the idea of forming kind of a national network of singers who could exchange songs, could help each other gather material and write material for the current moment.</p>

<p>The big thing that was going on right after the war was union organizing, and everybody was trying to get themselves together. And we were, I was in Detroit, you know, so it’s a UAW-CIO, makes the army roll and go.</p>

<p>[“UAW-CIO Makes the Army Roll and Go” by Pete Seeger plays.]</p>

<p>BD: You know, Pete had this Peoples’ Songs Bulletin, he called it. It was like a little mailer, four-page thing, it grew and grew and it eventually became Sing Out! Magazine.</p>

<p>JS: That’s how it started! I didn’t know that.</p>

<p>BD: Uh huh. That’s right.</p>

<p>Well, Pete, anyway, came to Detroit. I was 18. I was singing in front of picket lines and things, and recruited me to be the Detroit organizer.</p>

<p>Well, I was pretty ill-equipped for that because I didn’t have any money. I was basically, you know, I just left home and I was trying to figure out how to get my feet on the ground.</p>

<p>[“900 Miles” by Barbara Dane plays.]</p>

<p>JS: So you meet people Seeger when you’re around 18 years old in Detroit, and he presumably, he hears you sing.</p>

<p>BD: Sure.</p>

<p>JS: And then enlists you.</p>

<p>BD: It was the other way around.</p>

<p>JS: You enlist him, yeah.</p>

<p>BD: [Laughs.]</p>

<p>JS: But how was it, at that point in history, a high school student gets involved with struggles for racial equality? Like, what was it in your life that steered you in that direction before you met Pete Seeger?</p>

<p>BD: Well, probably the fact that my dad who is the product of a town in Arkansas called Paragould, which even today is known as Klan country. And he was raised with a very — that mentality, you see. But, on the other hand, he was a very kind man. He was a pharmacist, he was a barefoot farm boy and he really managed to get himself a pharmacist degree, somehow, and got to Detroit and got himself a little store way out on the outskirts of town.</p>

<p>Well, something happened — a very specific incident happened when I was about ten years old and I was working in the store. It was Detroit. It was Depression — deep Depression. A whole road gang of black men was outside with pick and shovel, making a roadbed right next to the drugstore, making a side street and it was really hot. And one man had the courage to come in this place, in the store, and he asked for a Coca-Cola — Coke-Cola, they called it, people from the South called it Coke-Cola.</p>

<p>And he had his nickel in his hand, it cost a nickel, and I motioned him to sit down. Well, of course, he was from the south and he had only recently come up North, he didn’t know which way to go. He didn’t know if I was allowed or not allowed. And I’m a child, he doesn’t know whether to accept my instruction. Just, at the point where he’s trying to decide, and I’m beckoning, my dad comes running from the prescription room where he’d been compounding some prescription, and yelling, “Get out of here — you know you can’t drink that in here.” And then he went off all over the guy and all over me, and the man left very quietly and, you know, no problem. And then my dad said, “Well, you know, you can’t do that. You can’t have, can’t have them in here because that way we’ll lose all of our other customers.” I realized then my dad was afraid of losing any customer because of Depression time, right?</p>

<p>Somehow in that moment, you see, what happened was I knew it wasn’t fair. I was horrified. And I was humiliated because I had done exactly as I’d been told and I was humiliated in front of another adult. Then I thought about the man who had been kicked out. What about him, you know? And something happened. And I actually, I took his side — he was right. He was completely right. My dad was wrong.</p>

<p>So that led me to question that kind of interchange for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>JS: How did that then segue to singing, though?</p>

<p>BD: Well, I always sang.</p>

<p>JS: Political singing.</p>

<p>BS: Well, I always sang, and then as I began to be part of movements, be standing in front of a shop gate somewhere, you know, and I’m singing roll the Union Out and I’m realizing that there are these other issues, starting to add other things in, and then this is well before the lunch counter sit-ins, but we decided to have a test case. We put together an interracial group and we went in the hotel bar alone, which is right on Cadillac Square, the famous — Catholic Square is where all a great union rallies were and all the protests and everything, it’s like Times Square but in Detroit.</p>

<p>By the hotel, right there, the big hotel on the far side — that hotel, two years before, I think, had refused a refuge to Paul Robeson of all people. So we decided we would test the coffee shop. We were seated over by the bathrooms, of course. And we sat there, we sat there; they never would serve us. Eventually, we were just thrown out.</p>

<p>[“It Isn’t Nice” by Barbara Dane and the Chambers Brothers plays.]</p>

<p>BD: After that, it was one after the other occasion to sing about that kind of thing.</p>

<p>JS: You also did a lot of speaking out and singing out around the issue of GI resistance. Coming out of World War II, I mean that was supposedly the good war, and also there was Uncle Joe Stalin, and, you know, there was this strategic relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, that very quickly then turned into something other than a friendship and then the Cold War really started in force.</p>

<p>That issue, though, of GI resistance at that time was very different from Vietnam.</p>

<p>BD: Yes.</p>

<p>JS: When then it became an extremely public stance, people burning draft cards. What was your gateway into the GI Resistance Movement?</p>

<p>BD: I know people like Dave Dellinger.</p>

<p>JS: He was a friend of mine, and I was very young, but I got to know Dave and I traveled with him for five years or so.</p>

<p>BD: Yeah.</p>

<p>JS: For people that don’t know, Dave Dellinger was the eldest member of the Chicago 8, and that’s sort of the line about him in history. But his memoir was called: “From Yale to Jail.” He was in Spain during the uprising against Franco, as a journalist, sort of activist, and was one of the most noble, active pacifists.</p>

<p>BD: Very, very open. But he went to jail as a conscientious objector in World War II.</p>

<p>Oddly enough in California, when most of my singing was done at the Ash Grove in LA, I was looking for a piano player, kept telling everybody I needed a blues player who has a certain touch, and a guy came in and just blew me away, Kenny Whitson was his name, he was my piano man. Well, Kenny was also a conscientious objector in World War II, which I didn’t know, until we’d been together quite a long time. I was so proud of that.</p>

<p>So, as soon as I saw actual GI’s actually resisting by putting together some kind of a hangout, where they could be themselves and talk about their own issues and all that, and I thought: Well, I have to be part of this. This is the place to hit the whole thing. Because those are the most vulnerable. Those are the ones that are going to — these are the ones where the choice is life and death right now. They’re going to go there and either live or die, right? So I’ve got to go do what I can do.</p>

<p>OK, so these coffee houses sprang up in several different places, near the army bases — you couldn’t get it on the base.</p>

<p>JS: And were they Army bases in the U.S. or around — ?</p>

<p>BD: They were near army bases all over. The one that I went to most and remember the most is Fort Hood because Fort Hood was, it’s one of the biggest bases in the country.</p>

<p>JS: In Texas, yeah.</p>

<p>BD: And as far as, you know, sending people off to Vietnam, it was huge.</p>

<p>JS: So you just mentioned Fort Hood, but when you would go to these coffee houses, positioned near these military bases, what would sort of an average evening or day or what would you say?</p>

<p>BD: Well, I had one thing — it went all over the map, but I would always had this one long piece that I constructed out of “We Shall Not Be Moved.”</p>

<p>BD: Well, this is a song that’s been jumping around the country since before the Civil War. A long time. It’s been used in all kinds of struggles, big ones and little ones, and it’s back on the scene again. And it goes like this: [Singing.] “We shall, we shall not be moved. We shall not, we shall not be moved. Just like a tree, that’s planted by the water, we shall not be moved.” Oh, you know the song, all right!</p>

<p>BD: They always knew the chorus, and they could sing the chorus. I could put all these different historical points and spread it out around the world, all through this one song vehicle.</p>

<p>BD: [Singing.] We’re not afraid of gun thugs, we shall not be moved. We’re not afraid gun thugs, we shall not be moved. Just like a tree, that’s planted by the water, we shall not be moved.</p>

<p>When I was a kid growing up in Detroit. [Audience member yells, “Detroit, yeah!”] Yeah! I used to sing outside the shop gates while the auto workers were trying to fight for pay raises right after World War II, and we used to sing: [Singing.] “The union is behind us, we shall not be moved.”</p>

<p>BD: The idea that I felt very important for me to convey in that is that you’re not alone, because the Army was very good at trying to feel make them feel isolated and small. And knock it off! You know? Sending him out. put him in the brig, send him into another base, send him off to Vietnam, whatever, get rid of these guys.</p>

<p>I would get into a little conversation with them afterward, you know? And a lot of times it would be, I could sense — OK, they’re talking to an older woman, sorta like their mothers, surrogate for the moment, and they’re wondering, you know, I gotta make this big decision. Am I going to resist? I could go to Canada, I go to Sweden, I could go to — I don’t know what I could do. I could good run away from here. I could get out of here.</p>

<p>So my advice was very simple, very simple. I just said: “Listen, you know, you’re a human being and you’re an individual. You have your ideas. You have your heart and your ethics. And you’ve got to live with that your whole life. So follow yourself. Follow your own instincts. What you think is best for you. Now maybe your dad, your mother, your grandma your girlfriend are all going to say, ‘Oh, he was a coward — he didn’t go. Or he, you know, he changed his mind, and he isn’t the big hero we thought he was going to be or whatever.’ But believe me, when all that’s over and the war is over and people are back to getting their heads together, they’re going to think of you as a hero. Because they’re going to see you did the right thing. So, and even if they don’t, you will look in the mirror and know that you did the right thing. So it’s up to you. I’m going to tell you what to do.”</p>

<p>[“The Resistance Hymn” by Barbara Dane plays.]</p>

<p>JS: I want to ask you about the founding of Paredon records in 1970, which you founded with Irwin Silber, your late husband. One of the things that fascinated me when I was reading about it was that you were looking for international voices, and trying to support singers around the world and bring their music and the politics of their music and the culture of their music to a broader audience.</p>

<p>But how do you how do you remember it, and what’s the legacy of Paredon records?</p>

<p>BD: Well the legacy is simple. I was invited to the Cancion Protesta Encuentro, which happened the year after I went there. And they gave me a little bit of credit for kind of bringing the impulse to create that.</p>

<p>JS: This was in Cuba?</p>

<p>BD: In Cuba. And the reason they pulled that together was because of the fact that Cuba understood that there’s a lot of music being made coming out of the movements that were going on for liberation, just for justice of one kind or another in different countries. They pulled together some representation from over thirty countries — a lot of places. A guy came from Africa, someone came from Australia.</p>

<p>So what did I do? I went back home from that all fired up, with all this music from all these people whose — talk about blood sweat and tears, man. I mean these people have to go through hell. They can’t, they can’t really make a living from it. They got to figure out some way of staying alive, and you got to do your music and you got to confront all sorts of repression at the same time, and keep up on the issues and keep your craft together, and always think, “OK, so I went back and I said I got to do something with this, and I first tried to translate, make singable lyrics. I did from two to three songs. That, that was an interesting experience, and I learned something, and I got some of the good songs out of it.</p>

<p>But I realized: No, they need to hear it in the original languages, from the people who made it. I have to have a record label, and put this stuff out. So, I just went around telling everybody that I knew I was going — what are you going to do now that you’ve done all this travel and Cuba? And I said, “Well, I’m going to start a record label.” I just said it as a fact. I didn’t know how I was going to do it.</p>

<p>And I wanted something from Northern Ireland, for example. I was in England, and I was having dinner with Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger, and I said, I talked about that. And Ewan said, “Well, I can put you in touch with these Northern Ireland people, but they’re all underground, so I can’t give you their names.” And I still to this day don’t know their names. They put out two albums. But they just sent me the stuff clandestinely.</p>

<p>[Music plays.]</p>

<p>JS: Where were they recorded?</p>

<p>BD: Wherever. I mean, underground. Most, a lot of it underground, somewhere, in some country.</p>

<p>JS: And how would you get the recordings?</p>

<p>BD: Well, like I did the ones from Northern Ireland. One day, the Guardian — somebody got to the Guardian and asked for contact to me and called me blind, and said: “Would you meet me in this coffeehouse? I got some Chilean material.” And I met him, and the guy that shows up is missing a couple of fingers from torture, and he’s handing me a couple of boxes of tape. But I never knew their names or their organization or who was in it.</p>

<p>Later on, I found out it was well-known artists on there, some of them.</p>

<p>JS: But you also, in ’73, “I Hate the Capitalist System.”</p>

<p>BD: That’s one of the ones I’ve been getting orders for lately.</p>

<p>JS: Well!</p>

<p>BD: [Laughs.]</p>

<p>JS: Your music has the burden of being both timely and timeless.</p>

<p>BD: Mmm. Unfortunately, it is timeless.</p>

<p>And, of course, you know, when you see that title, I just put it out there boldly, no decoration, because I wanted it to be as blatant and just in-your-face as possible. Some people: “Oh, ‘I hate’? Why do you want to say you hate anything?”</p>

<p>And I said, “Well, because I do!” [Laughs.] “I hate this system — not this country, not these people, my people! My country! I don’t hate that at all. I love it! Who do you think I’m doing this for? I hate the system it’s being run under. And that’s what we got to get straight.”</p>

<p>So, OK, the song was written by a miner’s wife. Her husband had gotten TB from working in the mines from lack of milk, as it says in the song. Her mother is dying or dead from starvation. Her whole family is falling apart, because of the conditions in the Appalachian are they were in, and her name is Sarah Ogan Gunning, that goes a little bit like this: [Singing.] I hate the capitalist system, and what it has done to me.</p>

<p>[“I Hate the Capitalist System” by Sarah Ogan Gunning, performed by Barbara Dane.]</p>

<p>BD: It goes on like that, she didn’t make any of this up, this is straight out of her life, all right? So there it is! So take it or leave it, look at it in the face, though. It’s your country! It’s your people! It’s your brothers and sisters. that are living like that.</p>

<p>JS: You know, your legacy, also, is resistance.</p>

<p>BD: Yes, it is!</p>

<p>JS: It’s resistance. So how do you see where we are right now? Given all of your life experience.</p>

<p>BD: Well, I’ll tell you. It’s always the calm before the storm and the storm before the calm. And, you know, you can get pretty gloomy. But if you think of it instead as a spiral, and you see, in increments it goes maybe a little bit, but each time it goes around, and it’s a little bit more, so we have to believe in the fact that things can get better, and it is, in fact, the only thing that will keep you feeling positive and optimistic is to keep your eye on the fact that there are human beings all over the globe who feel the same as you do, who are working toward the same ends that you are. There are peace and justice lovers and fighters in every country, and even in every class.</p>

<p>JS: But it must also give you inspiration that your music is now, here we are in the year 2018, you were born in 1927, your music is resonating with young people who are facing down what they view as an authoritarian government.</p>

<p>BD: Yes!</p>

<p>JS: And a world where fascism is once again on the rise.</p>

<p>BD: That’s right. Yeah. Well, that’s why I keep mentioning this idea that it does go around and hits the other side and pretty soon it’s, I mean Hitler, with the horrible scourge and terrifying thing in my youth, but he’s dust now. He’s dust! In fact, he’s merde, you know? Nobody cares about him anymore, except to point him out as, you know, we don’t want that anymore.</p>

<p>But it— all of that, all of that horror of the 40s and all of the horror of the McCarthy period and that nasty stuff then, and the horror of the Vietnam War, all of these things are behind us — one after another we get behind that and we get somewhere a little bit more higher in the spiral.</p>

<p>JS: Well, Barbara Dane, I want to thank you for all of the passion, the resistance, the music that you have given to all of us, and may it continue on for another 91 years and beyond.</p>

<p>BD: Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="theushastakenmorethan3700childrenfromtheirparentsandhasnoplanforreturningthem">The U.S. Has Taken More Than 3,700 Children From Their Parents — and Has No Plan for Returning Them</h2>

<p>The Trump administration’s program of systematically separating migrant children from their parents is steadily expanding, government officials confirmed Tuesday. Under Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s “zero tolerance” doctrine, U.S. authorities have been ordered to criminally prosecute all individuals arrested for illegally crossing the border without exception, including asylum-seekers and parents arriving with small children.</p>

<p>The result has been historic, and catastrophic, with the U.S. government intentionally creating thousands of so-called unaccompanied minors whose immigration cases have now become separate from their parents, plunging them, on their own, into an already overwhelmed system of federal bureaucracies.</p>

<p>In a phone call with reporters, senior officials at the various agencies responsible for the crackdown said thousands of families have been impacted by the measures so far. They added that there is no uniform, border-wide guidance in place establishing rules for how immigration agents on the ground should handle cases involving sensitive populations, such as babies and small children. Instead, officials said, it is up to Border Patrol chiefs at individual stations to exercise “discretion” in determining how to handle such cases. Officials described the ongoing effort as a program aimed at “deterrence.”</p>

<p>Brian Hastings, acting chief of law enforcement operations for the Border Patrol, told reporters that from May 5, 2018, through June 9, 2018, a total of 2,235 families comprising 4,548 people were apprehended along the southern border. “The total number of children that were made UACs through this prosecution initiative,” he explained, was 2,342, and the total number of adults referred for prosecution during that time period was 2,206.</p>

<p>“All humanitarian considerations and policies remain in place. There’s discretion given to the field chiefs over each of the nine southwest border sectors for the appropriate referrals for sensitive cases, those include adults who are traveling with tender-age children,” Hastings said. “The chiefs in the field are allowed to make that discretionary call.” When asked if that meant there was no blanket, border-wide guidance on the separation of infants from their parents, Hastings replied, “That’s correct.” He added that “the chiefs in the field” have “generally” considered children under the age of 5 as being “tender aged.” Hastings could not provide statistics on the number of children under 5 who his agency has separated from their parents.</p>

<p>Steve Wagner, acting assistant secretary at Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families, which oversees the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is in turn responsible for the children the government is taking into custody, said his agency hopes the program will deter parents from entering the country without authorization. “We expect that the new policy will result in a deterrence effect,” he said. “We certainly hope that parents stop bringing their kids on this dangerous journey and entering the country illegally, so we are prepared to continue to expand capacity as needed. We hope that will not be necessary in the future.”</p>

<p>Wagner had no numbers to provide regarding families who have been reunited, post-prosecution, under the administration’s new program.</p>

<p>Shortly after the call, McClatchy, citing a review of federal data, reported that the “Trump administration has likely lost track of nearly 6,000 unaccompanied migrant children, thousands more than lawmakers were alerted to last month.” Last week, the government said it separated 1,995 children from their parents from April through May. Today, the Border Patrol cited a somewhat larger number — 2,342 — for May through June. Earlier this month, The Intercept reported a minimum of 1,358 children were separated from their parents from October 2017 through mid-May. While precise numbers remain fuzzy, due to overlapping timelines reported by different media outlets, it is safe to say the number of migrant kids separated from their parents by the Trump administration is well over 3,700 and climbing.</p>

<p>Testifying before lawmakers last month, the deputy chief of Customs and Border Protection, which oversees the Border Patrol, said he anticipates that the government will continue separating families at a rate of roughly 650 cases every two weeks into the foreseeable future. The Border Patrol chief in the nation’s busiest sector, meanwhile, is pushing his agents to ramp up arrests and prosecutions even more, telling the Washington Post over the weekend that his office has not yet reached 100 percent enforcement — as the administration has called for — but that they are working to get there.</p>

<p>Such an increase would require overcoming the mounting political and public pushback the administration’s efforts are currently receiving. But even if zero tolerance ended tomorrow, thousands of families have already been separated, so the question remains: Is there a functional mechanism in place to insure those parents get their kids back?</p>

<p>For attorneys and advocates on the ground, the answer at the moment is no. In a series of interviews over the last week, federal public defenders and legal advocates working within the immigrant detention system and at the ports in Arizona, as well as providers of care to migrant kids nationally and U.S. immigration officials, were unanimous in their criticism of the system — or lack thereof — currently in place to reunite migrant children with their parents.</p>

<p>Dona Abbott is the branch director of refugee services for Bethany Christian Services, a leading organization involved in placing children in ORR custody in foster care. With more than 40 years of experience dealing with children fleeing violence and persecution, she told The Intercept that there is simply no system in place for the reunification of families to criticize or praise. Instead, she said, there is a never-ending list of questions that people who deal with the fallout of family separations have been forced to answer on their own: How do you reunify children with parents who are being deported? Can we reunify them before they’re deported? What does the parent want? What does the parent say is in the child’s best interest?</p>

<p>“Just finding the parent sometimes is a challenge,” Abbott explained.</p>

<p>No System in Place</p>

<p>Sometimes arresting agencies are handing kids over to ORR with identifying information, Abbott said, and sometimes they aren’t. Again, she said, there’s no system in place. “There’s a lot of families and a lot of kids affected by this — a lot,” she said. At the same time, none of the child welfare organizations that deal with unaccompanied minors, which the administration is creating more and more of each week, were consulted or warned before “zero tolerance” became the official enforcement posture of the federal government in early April. “We didn’t have a chance to ask questions and talk about how will the system work,” Abbott said. “Typically, you like to do that.”</p>

<p>Currently, the government’s solution for parents whose children it has taken is a 1-800 number. This also presents a problem, Abbott said, because often parents in detention have little to no access to phones. “What we’re finding is that we’re having to call detention centers,” she explained. As an example, Abbott pointed to the case of an 8-year-old girl who Bethany Christian is currently providing care for. “She’s been separated from her mom about a week, and we just keep calling all of the detention centers,” she explained. “Do you have someone by this name?” they ask. “The 1-800 number hasn’t been called, probably because mom hasn’t been allowed to make the call and we’re just not sure where mom is,” Abbot said.</p>

<p>For little kids, certainty about a parent’s whereabouts is of critical importance, Abbott said. “When you’re 8, a week is a long time,” she said. “You just don’t know, is my mom safe?” The issue of state-enforced separations, involving armed men in uniforms with guns, she added, can be particularly jarring for children from areas in Central America and Mexico where the line between organized crime and government security forces is nonexistent, and the entire purpose of the journey north was to escape precisely those kinds of scenarios. Abbott described the case of 10-year-old boy who tells the story of seeing his father handcuffed before they were separated. “That is scary for someone coming from a country where we know, it’s been reported over and over again, police are corrupted,” Abbott explained.</p>

<p>This particular boy’s ordeal also involved another troubling development emerging in recent cases, Abbott added: agents in the field, specifically Border Patrol agents, making on-the-ground calls about who gets to try to claim asylum and who does not. “Border Patrol seems to have a lot of independence and autonomy in their decisions,” Abbott said. “In the case of this little 10-year-old, there just didn’t seem to be anything other than they didn’t think dad had an asylum case and they immediately deported him, but they didn’t deport his son, and they didn’t make sure they went together. So now we have to try to reunite them. And the son is indigenous, which adds another layer of issues.”</p>

<p>Rather than install a system that reunites children with their parents, the administration has imposed at least one new measure that could decrease that likelihood. Earlier this month, McClatchy reported that ORR had entered into a new agreement with the Department of Homeland Security, in which the agency would share fingerprints and run immigration checks on potential sponsors who come forward to take custody of kids. “It’s not just the parent,” Abbott explained. “The new rule is everyone in the household, every adult in the household, must be fingerprinted, and those fingerprints, all those fingerprints, must be handed over to the Department of Homeland Security for criminal investigation. That means, probably, detention and deportation.” Already, as McClatchy reported, “the percentage of unaccompanied youths claimed by parents has dropped from 60 percent four years ago to 41 percent in 2017 after increasing crackdowns.” Abbott expects more of that to come.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine it won’t exacerbate a difficulty with sponsors not feeling safe coming forward to claim their family member, their child,” she said.</p>

<p>In a call with reporters last week, public affairs officials with the various Trump administration agencies responsible for separating migrant kids from their parents defended their actions on the grounds that they have no other choice, falsely claiming that the law requires such separations. Demanding that they not be quoted in their effort to “correct the record,” the flacks blamed the media for irresponsible reporting. In particular, they claimed that the federal government is not separating babies from their parents and denying that government agents have used false pretenses to take kids from their parents, never to be returned again. Abbott said both claims were false.</p>

<p>For one, she said, the government has definitely separated babies from their parents. “The average age now of a child we have in care is 7, but we have children from 8 months all the way to 17,” she said. Second, she said, Bethany Christian provided care for a 6-year-old girl, who, along with her mother, described the pretense of a bath being used to carry out a separation. “Her mother was told, ‘We’re going to give her a bath,’ and they took her and never brought her back. Put her in foster care. I’m sure some immigration officer thought that saved the trauma of the separation, crying and screaming, but I can’t imagine what that mom thought,” Abbott said. “Maybe what the government is trying to say is, ‘We’re not systematically condoning that,’” Abbott said, but the fact remains: “We’ve heard it directly from a parent and a child.”</p>

<p>The chaotic implementation of “zero tolerance” is leading to all sorts of experiences like this, Abbott argued, and the public is only hearing a fraction of them. She described another, about a little boy who came to Bethany Christian carrying a belt. “An adult belt just rolled up and clung in his hands,” Abbott explained. “We were like, ‘Oh, what’s this about?’ We finally get the belt away from him and inside, as we unravel it, is dad’s name and phone number.” For Abbott, the presence of the number sent a clear message. “Dad had in one last desperate moment” said to himself: “What can I send with my son that tells somebody where to find me?”</p>

<p>“So he writes it on his belt,” she said. “We’ve just had too many kids have those kind of separation stories to suggest that it is anything but a little chaotic. More than a little bit — it is chaotic.”</p>

<p>Abbott is hardly alone in her concerns. Two sources The Intercept interviewed regarding the government’s family separation program — including an attorney who has represented children in ORR custody and a senior DHS official working on immigration issues — spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the press. They, too, pointed to the absence of an effective system to reunite parents with their kids.</p>

<p>Contrary to claims from the administration, the attorney said the government is indeed separating parents from children even when those families present themselves at lawful ports of entry. “We’re definitely seeing that, even though sometimes the administration says they’re not doing that,” they told The Intercept. Similarly, they added, the government’s claim, relayed in a background call with reporters last week, that it is not separating babies from their parents, is simply not true. “That’s wrong,” they said. “We’re seeing babies.”</p>

<p>No Way Home</p>

<p>The likelihood that those children will find their way back to their parents is entirely uncertain, the attorney added. In cases where a parent expresses a desire to be deported with their child, Immigration and Customs Enforcement promises to coordinate on reunification, they said, but has routinely failed to follow through. “We’ll get a promise of coordination and then it doesn’t happen,” they said, adding that instead attorneys come to learn that a parent has already been deported just as the reunification process is unfolding. “There’s just not any commitment to the coordination of removal or reunification before removal. There doesn’t seem to be any plan.” The DHS official agreed with that assessment. “It’s all up in the air,” they told The Intercept. “There’s no way this ends well. I feel like now that we’ve crossed this precipice, there’s no limit as to how far Trump and his people will go.”</p>

<p>In the absence of clarity, defense attorneys involved in the prosecutions that lead to family separations have turned to federal magistrate judges for relief, and in some cases, the judges are taking action.</p>

<p>In Tucson, upwards of 70 migrants are criminally prosecuted, in group hearings, for illegally crossing the border every day under the government program known as Operation Streamline. With those prosecutions spiking 71 percent over the last year, and family separations becoming routine, federal defense attorneys have begun asking judges presiding over the hearings to take unusual steps in order to increase the chances that parents will be reunited with their children. “One of the things we were asking for the judges to order, and the judges have been receptive to ordering, is that our clients be kept here, even if they receive a sentence of time served, and they’re subject to deportation — that they be kept here in order to be reunited with their kids,” Molly Kincaid, a federal public defender in Tucson told The Intercept. “They’d literally rather be kept in custody and reunited with their children.”</p>

<p>Kincaid explained, “Most of our clients who are affected by this are getting the misdemeanor, they’re only being charged with the misdemeanor because it’s their first entry.” Normally, she said, people charged with the first-time offense take the plea, accept the time served, and are quickly deported. Now that parents and children are in the mix, she said, an increasing number of defendants are expressing that they want to remain in the country. “It’s very bizarre because most of the time that’s what our clients want — they want the misdemeanor and to go back home as soon as possible, but when you have a child here, obviously that’s the most important thing,” Kincaid said.</p>

<p>So far, the magistrate judges in Tucson have appeared receptive to the effort. “In every single case where an attorney is requesting that recommendation, our magistrate judges are making them,” Christina Woehr, also a federal public defender in Tucson, told The Intercept. In an effort to bolster recommendations, Kincaid has additionally sought orders requiring the government to disclose the locations of children in custody. Any increase in transparency would be a welcome change, the two attorneys said.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Kincaid appeared before Magistrate Judge Bruce G. Macdonald’s during a Streamline hearing. Her client, Cerafino Perez Andres, a Guatemalan father, had crossed the border with his 15-year-old daughter five days earlier. Following his arrest, Perez Andres’s daughter was taken by the government and, standing before Macdonald, Kincaid explained that he had no idea where she was. Federal prosecutor Christopher Lewis told Macdonald that CBP and the U.S. Attorney’s Office have “no knowledge or control as to where they will place those children,” and that the kids are the responsibility of ORR, which does not have a mechanism for reporting back on the whereabouts of the children it receives from DHS agencies.</p>

<p>“I’m hoping, though, that you can ask them to at least provide you with that information,” Macdonald told Lewis, according to audio of the hearing obtained by the Arizona Daily Star.</p>

<p>“I can inquire, but there’s no mechanism on the part of ORR to report that back,” the prosecutor replied.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m asking for you to ask them to report that back,” the judge said.</p>

<p>Cosme Lopez, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, stressed that the judge’s words were not an order. “I think the pivot point here is ORR,” Lopez told The Intercept, downplaying the Department of Justice’s role in family separations. “Our involvement has really not changed that much,” he said. “We have nothing to do with the children or the apprehension,” he added. “Our piece is so minute, it’s not even funny,” he insisted. The DOJ does not literally apprehend then process children, but the department’s role in family separation is not “minute.” Family separation is the consequence of a “zero tolerance” directive initiated by Sessions, who is head of the Justice Department. This change in prosecutorial priorities is at the very core of the national scandal that family separation has evolved into. The DOJ is just as implicated as all of the other enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>Kincaid and Woehr, the federal public defenders, point out that judges placing detention recommendations on their clients’ cases is hardly a solution to the situation at hand. They describe the measures more like a band-aid intended to staunch the enormous due process and emotional damage currently being done to migrant families. “It’s a pretty terrible choice to have to make as a parent,” Woehr said. “Do you want to be held in indefinite detention hoping you are reunited with a child who, you don’t know where they are, or do you want to ask to be deported and let your child’s immigration case wind its way through our system?” Woehr added, “The issue we run into with asking the government to disclose the location of the children is ICE says, ‘Well, they’re not in our custody anymore; they’re in ORR custody, so we have no way of finding their location,’ which shifts the burden of finding the location of the child to our detained or deported clients, which just adds to the terrible situation that they’re facing.”</p>

<p>“It’s Kafkaesque,” she said. “It’s just a nightmare.”</p>

<p>Kincaid agreed. “It’s one of the things that we’re struggling with right now and that we’re trying to address — is basically how to follow up with our clients to see if this reunification is happening, to see if they’re actually staying here, or they’re just getting deported immediately and their kids are staying here, which is obviously the worst-case scenario for most of our clients,” she said. “I can tell you that the whole situation seems to be shrouded in mystery for us.” Both pushed back on arguments, such as those from the Trump administration, that the migrants impacted by family separation bring their kids to U.S. in order to exploit a loophole and thus, gain entry into the country. “I don’t get that at all,” Kincaid said. “I’ve never heard that from any client,” Woeher added. Describing the experiences her clients have recounted, Kincaid said, “It really is more of a situation of real desperation.”</p>

<p>Fighting for Reunification</p>

<p>Beyond the horror of seeing parents separated from their kids, the attorneys said the current situation raises serious due process and proportionality questions. “Parents in this country who are citizens and are going through a process to potentially have their parental rights terminated — they have a lot of rights,” Kincaid pointed out, and yet, in the case of migrants, parents are losing their children through rapid-fire procedures in remote, closed-off government facilities. There’s also the question of how the punishment fits the crime, when the crime is a misdemeanor and the punishment is indefinitely losing your child. “You’re looking at a day in custody as your sentence, but oh, as a collateral consequence of your sentence, you’re going to lose your child for maybe a year — we don’t know,” Woeher said of the current practice.</p>

<p>For now, the public defenders’ focus remains on reunification, though it’s a campaign they wish they did not need to undertake. “We’re fighting for reunification right now but really, I think, the best thing that could happen is to go back to prosecutorial discretion, where you just don’t charge these cases,” Kincaid said. “Let’s not put ourselves in this situation to begin with, where we’re separating families.”</p>

<p>Part of what’s making the impact of “zero tolerance” and family separation so profoundly difficult to respond to, especially in terms of reunification, attorneys say, is that huge numbers of the people involved are little kids, toddlers, and babies — all of whom now have their own immigration cases, and no parents around to help.</p>

<p>With three offices and nearly 70 people on staff, the Florence Project has been the sole provider of free legal representation for people in immigration detention in the state of Arizona for nearly 30 years. Since January, the organization has documented 350 cases of family separation, and attorneys there are feeling the effects of representing very young clients. “Our kids program used to work mainly with 16-, 17-year-old Guatemalan boys, unaccompanied minors,” Lauren Dasse, the project’s executive director, told The Intercept. “Now we’re seeing a lot of young children. A lot of our clients are young and separated from parents.”</p>

<p>Those clients, Dasse said, have included a blind 6-year-old girl who was separated from her mother, and other preverbal, nonverbal, and disabled children and babies. The difficulty of sorting out these newly unaccompanied kids’ individual immigration cases, and reuniting them with their parents, is immense, Dasse said. “This is the most challenging thing I’ve seen,” she explained. “And I’ve heard that from staff cohorts in the field for a long time doing immigration defense and criminal defense, that this is the most challenging that they’ve had to do, is prep an inconsolable 4-year-old for their asylum hearing. You can imagine.”</p>

<p>And it’s not just the young kids, Dasse pointed out. “We have an older client, I think she’s 13, and she feels very guilty about her dad being detained because her dad was fleeing with her to keep them both safe,” she explained. “She’s put in a place where she has to make very adult-like decisions, with us representing her. She shouldn’t be in that place where she has to think of her own asylum case at this moment, because she has her guardian, her parent, as opposed to the unaccompanied minors that we’ve worked with for 20 years.”</p>

<p>Dasse described what’s felt like “a perfect storm of things that have happened over the past few months that have made our work and fighting your case so much more challenging.” She fears the combined impact of Trump administration efforts are aimed at increasing the time people spend in detention, so they will become more likely to abandon their cases, even if those cases involved potentially legitimate asylum claims. “Everything’s pointing to prolonged detention, and then the pressure is on people to give up on their cases,” she said. The DHS immigration official agreed, adding that the message from the administration appears to be “if you aren’t willing to be torn from your kids, spend six months or more in detention, and suffer humiliation and a complete upheaval of your life, then you don’t really need asylum.”</p>

<p>In response to the crackdown, the Florence Project is staffing up and building a rapid response team to handle family separation. Due to the government’s utter lack of transparency, much of that work involves combing through volumes of Streamline hearing transcripts, searching for parents whose children might have been taken. “It’s all very time-consuming,” she said. “Time-consuming and urgent. There’s an urgency right now that we’re all feeling.” The stakes right now couldn’t be greater, she argued.</p>

<p>“We are creating immeasurable trauma — immeasurable trauma, that will have lifelong effects on people,” Dasse said. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”</p>

<p>Abbott, of Bethany Christian, echoed that sentiment. “I’ve worked with unaccompanied children since 1977,” she said. “Forty years in child welfare, I’ve never seen anything quite like this. It’s so systematic.” Normally, she explained, the kids she works with have become unaccompanied for a reason. They are fleeing a war, for example, or a natural disaster, or some other crisis that causes them to enter the system without their parent. This is something different. In the U.S. context, she said, “people have managed to make it all the way to somewhere where they’re asking asylum and then are being separated.”</p>

<p>“This is purposeful, not part of the chaos of fleeing for your life. This is purposeful separation after you arrive at a border asking for safety,” Abbott said. “Quite honestly, I’ve never experienced where we use children as a deterrent.”</p>

<p id="byline">by: Shaun King</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/20/family-separation-immigration-history-slavery-mass-incarceration/ </p>

<p>Like most of you reading this, I am deeply appalled at what I see happening right now in the United States — immigrant children being snatched away from their parents and sent to separate detention centers, often locked in cages with strangers, with no real idea of when they’ll ever be reunited with their families. It’s an abomination.</p>

<p>But I often see two troubling responses to this crisis that show just how aloof and asleep millions of Americans are right now.</p>

<p>The first is a statement that goes something like this: This is not the America I know and love. The second is a question, rooted in the same ignorance, that goes something like this: How could this ever happen in the United States?</p>

<p>What’s happening right now in our country is, without question, a human rights catastrophe. Yet every deeply entrenched mechanism used in these policies and the spirit fueling this catastrophe are as American as Facebook and Disneyland.</p>

<p>Let me break it down. At least five troubling factors are at play here. All five were fully and completely present before this current crisis ever began. They set the tone and created the culture in which something so heinous could ever take place.</p>

<p>This has happened here before. It has happened millions of times across the years.</p>

<p>First, this has happened here before. In fact, it has happened millions of times across the years in this country. Africans forced into slavery in this country were routinely separated from their children — not only in being transported to the Americas, but then repeatedly at the auction block. Not thousands, but millions — of mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, parents and children, brothers and sisters — were all forcefully separated from each other. And this was no brief period of this nation’s history, but a feature of the institution of slavery that existed in the United States for nearly 250 years.</p>

<p>Not only were enslaved African children routinely separated from their families, but so too were Native Americans in this country. From the late 1800s all the way until the 1970s, children were routinely taken from Native American homes by force and sent to barbaric “Indian schools,” where their hair was cut and their names and culture stripped away. Many of them never saw their families again.</p>

<p>What might be most shocking, though, is the way the U.S. — today, in the present — separates so many families whose stories go unremarked upon. I’m talking about the crisis of mass incarceration in America, of which the crackdown on immigrants is but one horrific piece.</p>

<p>Right now, as you read this, hundreds of thousands of adults and children, disproportionately black and Latino, are in jails all over this country – not because they’ve been convicted of a crime, but because they cannot afford cash bail. Many of them will languish in jail not for days or weeks, but for months and years without ever being convicted of a crime. In fact, about 65 percent of people in local jails in this country on any given day have not been convicted of a crime. They are in jail simply because they cannot afford bail. They, too, are separated from their families.</p>

<p>You’d have a hard time finding an extended period of American history where children and parents of color weren’t forcefully separated from one another by the white power structure in this country. It’s woefully and painfully normal. And it’s because it’s so normal that it is so easy for it to happen again and again in this country. This nation has mastered separating parents and children. Pretending otherwise is to offer a revisionist history.</p>

<p>It should come as no surprise, then, that so many on the right — those who would bristle at acknowledging, let alone apologizing for, this history — are embracing a policy of forced family separation.</p>

<p>On Monday night, Fox News’s Laura Ingraham said, with a smug smile, that the immigrant children being held in detention centers are “essentially in summer camp.” This, in spite of the reality that the leading doctors and medical groups across the country have said that forcefully separating children from their parents in detention centers causes “irreparable harm” to the children. This, in spite of the gut-wrenching audio obtained by ProPublica of detained children sobbing and wailing for their parents while they are mocked by guards.</p>

<p>Nearly 60 percent of Republicans approve the practice of separating immigrant children from their parents at the border. And it’s not hard to understand why.</p>

<p>For years now, Donald Trump has dehumanized border-crossing Latinos every chance he gets — routinely calling them animals, murderers, and rapists. He reduced entire nations of color to being “shithole countries.” On Monday, he reiterated this, saying immigrants were coming from “the most dangerous places in the world.”</p>

<p>This essential step — of reducing immigrants to a subhuman status — must not be overlooked. It happened throughout the transatlantic slave trade. It happened throughout the genocide of Native Americans. It happened throughout the Holocaust. It happened throughout the Rwandan genocide. It happens today with victims of police brutality.</p>

<p>Whenever a group of people suffers unspeakable horrors and oppression, the people in power first reduce and dehumanize them — making it such that the conscience of the people in power is fully at ease during the oppression. This is how Ingraham could compare the detention centers to “summer camps”: She has convinced herself that the United States is doing these subhuman children a favor.</p>

<p>At the root of the current human rights crisis at American borders is white supremacy and bigotry. Trump does not have a problem with immigrants. His mother was an immigrant from Scotland. His grandparents were all immigrants. His first wife, Ivana, was an immigrant from what is now the Czech Republic; Trump’s children with her — Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric — have an immigrant parent. Trump’s third wife, Melania, is an immigrant from Slovenia. She became a citizen in 2006. His son with her, Barron, has an immigrant parent. So no, Trump doesn’t hate immigrants. But he does seem to hate immigrants of color. And this distinction is essential.</p>

<p>Melania Trump’s parents are beneficiaries of what Trump and the right call “chain migration.” They are in the United States legally because of their relationship to her. Trump and conservatives rail against this policy — but his parents and grandparents and in-laws all benefited from it. If the right wing hated immigrants, Trump would probably be among the least-liked public figures in the country. But many of those on the right — like everyone here but Native Americans — are all descendants of immigrants themselves. Their problem is not with immigrants; it’s with immigrants of color, be they from Mexico or the Americas or any of the nations listed in Trump’s Muslim ban.</p>

<p>White supremacy and bigotry drive so many American policies. Trump’s senior policy adviser Stephen Miller has shown bigoted tendencies since high school. And now he is said to be the chief author of both the Muslim ban and the new policy of separating immigrant children from their parents. We are living in the age where hate crimes are on the rise in the United States. White supremacists are running for office in record numbers.</p>

<p>There are two more essential factors at play in what we see happening at our border right now. We need to talk about these things to really understand what’s going on, to see how we got to this point.</p>

<p>The first is the reality that the United States is the incarceration nation. No nation in the entire world incarcerates more people than we do. We routinely have somewhere around 2.3 million people in jail and prison on any given day, and at least 10.6 million are put into jails and prisons every year. The United States has criminalized poverty, forcing people into jail if they cannot afford to pay the most basic fees, whether traffic tickets, court fines, or cash bail. The United States has criminalized drug addiction, sending millions of people to jail and prison over the generations for simple drug possession. This nation has criminalized mental illness. Two million people with a mental illness are jailed in this nation each year.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time until people seeking asylum at America’s borders were also criminalized and warehoused. It’s what this nation does.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time until people seeking asylum at America’s borders were also criminalized and warehoused. It’s what this nation does. Instead of solving our most difficult problems, we increase police forces, build more jails and prisons, including tent cities if necessary, and arrest people — especially people of color.</p>

<p>Lastly — and this is key — what we see happening right now at America’s borders has everything to do with profiteering and the privatization of America’s jails and prisons. It’s a huge, multibillion-dollar industry. Our nation has publicly traded companies whose business it is to profit off mass incarceration — and there is a profit margin on building and running emergency holding facilities and tent cities like we see being formed right now to detain immigrant children and families. Not only are these places being staffed and secured, but the food, the cleaning crews, and the supplies all have an exorbitant cost.</p>

<p>The same conservatives who campaign on cutting costs and reducing deficits then have no problem at all spending multiple billions of dollars on mass incarceration. Executives from the private prison industry have seen their profits explode under Trump, and he has been rewarded handsomely with six-figure donations from their executives. In this country, when you see evil, you can almost always follow the money trail.</p>

<p>What’s happening right now is awful. Period. No ifs, ands, or buts. It didn’t come out of nowhere, though. It came right from the American playbook. This nation has routinely mistreated and abused people of color for hundreds of years — and has willfully separated millions of families, sometimes permanently, for sport and profit, on this soil. Speak out against it. Organize against it. But just know that what you are seeing has deep roots.</p>

<h2 id="lawclaimingtofightsextraffickingisdoingtheoppositebycrackingdownonsexworkadvocacyandorganizing">Law Claiming to Fight Sex Trafficking Is Doing the Opposite — By Cracking Down on Sex Work Advocacy and Organizing</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Natasha Lennard</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-13</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/13/sesta-fosta-sex-work-criminalize-advocacy/ </p>

<p>On June 2, 1975, in the French city of Lyon, over 100 prostitutes occupied a church to protest police persecution. Their protest inaugurated the date as the first International Whores’ Day, also known as International Sex Workers’ Day, which passes most years with little attention. But this year on June 2, over 15 American cities saw protests in support of sex workers. Over 500 gathered in the San Francisco Bay Area, over 400 in New York, and over 100 in Chicago — sex worker rights advocates described it as the biggest wave of protest in their movement’s history.</p>

<p>After President Donald Trump signed the packaged Fight Online Sex Trafficking and Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers acts — known collectively as SESTA-FOSTA — into law in April, organizing around sex workers has been reinvigorated with a new urgency. The legislation, which purports to combat trafficking, instead cripples sex workers’ ability to work safely online. It’s merely the latest example in an unbroken history of harmful anti-sex work laws. But at a time when activism around, with, and for sex workers is all the more crucial, laws like SESTA-FOSTA are not only making sex work harder and more dangerous, but they’re also silencing and criminalizing the very organizing and advocacy that would help sex workers stay safe and fight persecution, even chilling journalists’ efforts to cover these issues.</p>

<p>“There is increased fear around what we as activists and advocates can post or share on social media.”</p>

<p>“There is increased fear around what we as activists and advocates can post or share on social media because of the self-censoring of websites and increased (whether real or perceived) law enforcement activity around the sex industry,” said Melissa Broudo, the co-director of the Sharmus Outlaw Advocacy and Rights Institute, a sex worker advocacy organization. “We as an advocacy project want to ensure that everyone feels safe engaging with us and others in the activist community, attending events, and speaking their mind to further the benefit and well-being of all in the sex industry. Unfortunately, given the climate because of SESTA-FOSTA, that is very difficult to do currently.”</p>

<p>In one poignant example of how these laws harm advocacy, the Desiree Alliance Conference — the largest U.S. gathering addressing human, labor, and civil rights for workers in the sex industry — announced that it will not take place this year due to fears surrounding SESTA-FOSTA. An announcement on their website said, “Due to FOSTA/SESTA enactments, our leadership made the decision that we cannot put our organization and our attendees at risk. We hope you understand our grave concerns and continue to resist every law that exists to harm sex workers!”</p>

<p>Much of the issue with the new legislation is that the language of the bills is imprecise and perniciously broad. Under SESTA-FOSTA, every site or online platform can be held liable for hosting what the law describes as “prostitution.” But the term “prostitution” is undefined and makes no distinction between human trafficking and consensual sex work. The framing is vague, but the implication is clear: Sex work is not seen as legitimate work, and as such, sex workers can’t organize as workers. With little clarity on how the law might be implemented, online platforms as well as activist groups themselves are moving with pre-emptive vigor to remove content with any relation to sex work — including anti-SESTA-FOSTA political speech.</p>

<p>On Facebook, an adult filmmaker shared a request from journalist Sofia Barrett-Ibarria seeking sex workers to speak to for a Vice article on the impact of SESTA. The user was banned from the social network for 30 days. “There was no nudity, no nipples, just literally THE WORDS ‘sex worker’ and ‘escort,’” Barrett-Ibarria tweeted. When sweeping algorithms are applied to comply with overly broad legislation, speech is chilled and so, too, is the activism it drives.</p>

<p>In another example, on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, progressive New York congressional candidate Suraj Patel began the hashtag #SurajAgainstSesta — a rare case of solidarity with sex workers from a politician. The hashtag was temporarily blocked for failing to meet community guidelines. Instagram also temporarily blocked the hashtag #Stripper, which refers to a legal profession.</p>

<p>From Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter, activists use hashtags to amplify messages, share news, and organize around protest days. For sex workers, organizing around social media hashtags can take on a different valence. “They’re really important as part of an infrastructure to build communication networks. These take time to build,” adult film performer and activist Lorelei Lee told me. “For many of us, social media is the only way to find each other.” Lee, a 37-year-old who has been a sex worker since the age of 19, noted that her working conditions changed dramatically once she had contact with others in her field. She told me that she has heard of a new example of sex workers banned or content blocked from Twitter or Facebook nearly every day in recent months, even while SESTA and FOSTA wound their way through Congress.</p>

<p>As online platforms remove content with pre-emptive zeal, meanwhile, sex worker organizers and advocates are themselves shutting down services and going silent in fear of potential repercussions. The Sacramento, California, chapter of the Sex Workers Outreach Project, an organization that provides resources and information to sex workers and trafficking victims (without conflating the two), is suspending its direct outreach services programs. The move is a reaction to the growing political threat to sex workers reflected in SESTA and FOSTA and a direct response to a proposed California bill, SB124, that would criminalize a swathe of interactions with prostitutes, including assisting their well-being.</p>

<p>If under SESTA-FOSTA even advocacy is threatened, organizing on the ground is in worse peril still. Lola Balcon, a community organizer with Survivors Against SESTA, noted that sex worker organizing around support services is uniquely criminalized. “In sex work only, there is a false division between community building, peer support and political advocacy, and only the latter is allowed (barely),” she wrote via email. “Compare this to any other labor movement, where unions do peer support (for example, members sharing info with each other about managers) and political advocacy.”</p>

<p>“When you take away our jobs, which laws like SESTA do, you take away our ability to organize and be activists.”</p>

<p>The Sacramento Sex Workers Outreach Project’s executive director Kristen DiAngelo is a current sex worker, educator, and also a former trafficking victim — living proof of the difference between coerced and consensual sex work. She told me that it was heartbreaking to shutter her group’s direct services, which included a safe house that could house up to six people, as well street outreach, providing hygiene kits, information on safety and rights to street-based workers. “We can’t put our volunteers and the people who use our services at greater legal risk,” DiAngelo said. “When you take away our jobs, which laws like SESTA do, you take away our ability to organize and be activists. How can anyone be a volunteer to help others if they can’t even support themselves?”</p>

<p>DiAngelo has seen wave after wave of legislation aimed at abolishing sex work under the guise of morality crusades. “This goes all the way back to 1912 and California’s Red Light Abatement — which I call prohibition — Act,” she said. The law caused all the state’s brothels to close within three years, forcing workers onto the streets. Then law enforcement targeted street work, too, leaving workers more and more vulnerable to exploitation. Despite her fears, however, DiAngelo is confident in sex workers as a community fighting back. “When we come back, we come back stronger,” she said, noting that she is seeing an unprecedented number of people standing in solidarity with sex workers against the new discriminatory legislation.</p>

<p>Many sex workers are afraid of being outed, stigmatized, and criminalized and are thus dissuaded from taking part in direct actions and protests. That’s why it’s so striking that thousands rallied for International Whores’ Day, making a bold claim to visibility, especially considering that many people are deserving of continued support at a moment when political forces aim to make sex workers invisible.</p>

<h2 id="newyorkgangdatabaseexpandedby70percentundermayorbilldeblasio">New York Gang Database Expanded by 70 Percent Under Mayor Bill de Blasio</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alice Speri</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-10</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/11/new-york-gang-database-expanded-by-70-percent-under-mayor-bill-de-blasio/ </p>

<p>The New York Police Department has quietly expanded its gang database under Mayor Bill de Blasio, targeting tens of thousands of young people of color for increased surveillance even in the absence of criminal conduct.</p>

<p>New Yorkers have been added to the NYPD gang database under de Blasio at a rate of 342 people per month, nearly three times the rate of the prior decade. That’s despite both historically low crime levels and the fact that gang-motivated crime makes up less than 1 percent of all reported crime in New York City.</p>

<p>New details about who the NYPD includes in the vast database were revealed in response to a public records request by CUNY School of Law professor Babe Howell, who shared the information with The Intercept. The data reveals that as of February 2018, there were 42,334 people in the database — a 70 percent increase since de Blasio took office in January 2014. Ninety-nine percent of those added over that four-year period were not white. The NYPD also maintains a database of “inactive” gang members that includes 2,706 people.</p>

<p>Graphic: Moiz Syed</p>

<p>The NYPD differentiates between crime committed to advance the interests of a gang — about 0.1 percent of all reported crime in the city between 2013 and 2017, according to Howell’s analysis — and crime committed by alleged gang members but not on behalf of gangs. According to the NYPD statistics, the latter category of crime doubled between 2013 and mid-2017, but still accounts for only 1.7 percent of all reported crime.</p>

<p>But the results of a separate Freedom of Information Law request suggest that the NYPD’s definition of what constitutes a gang is broad, vague, and disconnected from evidence of criminal activity.</p>

<p>Criminalizing Urban Youth</p>

<p>In two presentations released to legal groups and obtained by The Intercept, the department defines a gang as “a group of persons with a formal or informal structure that includes designated leaders and members, that engage in or are suspected to engage in unlawful conduct.”</p>

<p>“That definition, to me, is incredibly problematic,” said Marne Lenox, an attorney at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of the groups behind that records request. “They’re not even talking necessarily about a group of individuals who have already been found to have engaged in particular conduct. They’re talking about a group of people who may not have actually done anything criminal.”</p>

<p>While it’s not clear whom the presentations are intended for or how the department uses them, the slides list sweeping criteria to identify gang members — including “staying out late” and “changes in behavior,” as well as the use of video games, SnapChat, and Instagram — that could easily apply to most teenagers and young adults.</p>

<p>“The police are essentially criminalizing friendships,” Lenox said. “And really, we’re talking about kids. We’re talking about kids who attend school together, kids who grew up in the same neighborhood, who play basketball together, who communicate with their friends on social media.”</p>

<p>In one slide, the NYPD lists organized gangs as well as “crews,” which the department defines as “a group of people associated or classed together: company, set, team, dang group, gang,” with “no initiations” and “no consequences if you leave.” Another slide notes that “younger gang members are often receiving ‘training’ while incarcerated, making them better criminals when they re-enter the community.”</p>

<p>A slide from the NYPD Patrol Guide Procedures presentation defines “crews.”</p>

<p>Image: NYPD</p>

<p>In other slides, the NYPD lists colors associated with major gangs: black, gold, yellow, red, purple, green, blue, white, brown, khaki, gray, orange, and lime green. “I don’t think there’s a single color that exists on the color spectrum that would not fit into one of those potential gangs,” said Lenox.</p>

<p>Together, the new details about the gang database and the two presentations offer a glimpse of a sweeping surveillance effort by the NYPD, which has been collecting and cataloguing information about mostly young men of color with virtually no oversight or public scrutiny. On Wednesday, the City Council’s Committee on Public Safety will hold a hearing about the city’s gang policing practices after dozens of community and advocacy groups demanded more transparency from the NYPD. A rally against the department’s large gang raids is planned ahead of the hearing.</p>

<p>“What we know based on the FOIL request shows how important it is to demand transparency about what we don’t know,” said Howell, who first exposed details about the New York gang database in 2013. “There’s no crime to justify it. … It’s just a new way to profile the usual suspects that insulates them from public scrutiny and public approbation.”</p>

<p>Neither the NYPD nor the mayor’s office responded to The Intercept’s requests for comment.</p>

<p>Gang databases nationwide have increasingly come under scrutiny, particularly as President Trump’s exaggerated denunciations of the MS-13 gang have raised skepticism about the broad use of the label, and after immigration authorities have used gang databases to target undocumented individuals for deportation regardless of their criminal history. As these databases have grown more common, so have reports of the many errors they contain: CalGang, a database widely used in California, listed 42 infants under the age of 1 as active gang members.</p>

<p>So far, the NYPD has not made public the criteria it uses to add individuals to the database or details of how the list is used, shared, purged, or corrected. Individuals do not receive notification when they are added to the database, and there is no clear process to contest one’s inclusion in it. It’s also not clear to what extent the database has contributed to a series of large gang raids in recent years that have seen hundreds of NYPD and federal officers descend on public housing projects to make dozens of arrests. As The Intercept has reported, the raids have led to mass gang indictments in which prosecutors have used conspiracy statutes to punish entire communities for the crimes of a few. In 2016 alone, the NYPD conducted 41 “gang takedowns,” leading to more than 1,000 arrests. “We’re picking them off one by one, in many cases, dozens by dozens,” Commissioner James O’Neill said a January 2017 press conference.</p>

<p>As the NYPD gang database has ballooned in recent years and its impact on city residents has become evident, several organizations have filed public records requests that the NYPD has mostly stonewalled.</p>

<p>The Legal Aid Society, which along with a number of community organizations had demanded the NYPD release details of how the database is maintained and purged, has filed an administrative appeal and threatened litigation after the department failed to comply with the request. Legal Aid also launched a website to help New Yorkers file public records requests to learn whether they are listed in the database. Separately, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and the Center for Constitutional Rights also filed an administrative appeal after the NYPD rejected the bulk of two requests seeking information on safeguards to the constitutional rights of individuals included in the database.</p>

<p>“We knew that since the announcement of Operation Crew Cut, more and more people would be fed into the gang database,” said Anthony Posada, supervising attorney with Legal Aid’s Community Justice Unit, referring to the NYPD program that effectively launched the department’s war on gangs in 2012. “Specifically, black and Latino youth all across New York City.”</p>

<p>“[The data] confirms to us what we were suspicious about and wanting to know more about,” Posada added. “It is confirmation that there are these active programs … that really destroy the ability to build community trust — that are secretive, that are unconstitutional, that label people without an ability for them to be removed from that data.”</p>

<p>“Stop-and-Frisk 2.0” </p>

<p>Critics of the gang database say it’s no coincidence that the NYPD’s emphasis on gang policing intensified just as the city faced a class-action lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the department’s stop-and-frisk program — which at its height in 2011 saw 684,330 people stopped in one year. In 2013, a federal judge ruled stop and frisk unconstitutional. But by then, the NYPD had doubled its anti-gang units and begun monitoring suspects’ Facebook and YouTube activity — the first steps toward what has since expanded into a sprawling and sophisticated gang surveillance program.</p>

<p>“Before the gang database, it was actually called the gang book,” said Vidal Guzman, an organizer with JustLeadershipUSA, a prison reform group run by formerly incarcerated people. “Every precinct had basically a gang book, knowing who was who around a neighborhood, who was doing what, who was a leader.”</p>

<p>“The gang database, I call it the stop and frisk 2.0 because it just evolved,” added Guzman, who grew up in poverty and was first incarcerated when he was 16 years old. “If we can’t stop these individuals every moment, we’re just going to create a database where we are able to target the people that we can’t stop, and still see what they are doing without them even knowing.”</p>

<p>More than 90 percent of those stopped under stop and frisk were black and Latino; likewise, the NYPD gang database overwhelmingly targets nonwhite New Yorkers. According to the NYPD’s categories, nearly 66 percent of those added to the database between December 2013 and February 2018 were black and 33 percent were Hispanic. Blacks and Latinos respectively make up 25 percent and 27 percent of the city’s residents. Over the same four-year period, only 0.8 percent of the 17,452 people added to the list were white.</p>

<p>“They’re using ostensibly nonracial criteria — like the style of dress, neighborhood, where you hang out — to profile the very same communities that they were over-policing under the stop-and-frisk regime, in the absence of any criminality,” said Howell.</p>

<p>“The NYPD’s gang takedowns are the functional equivalent of the department’s unconstitutional stop-and-frisk policing tactic, and they’re regularly criminalizing innocuous behavior, much like stop-and-frisk policing used to do,” echoed Lenox. “None of this is to say that stop and frisk is over; but to the extent that the NYPD is touting the extraordinary decline in the number of people who are stopped by police, it’s incredibly interesting that as those stops decrease, the number of people identified as gang members increases dramatically.”</p>

<p>De Blasio, who came into office promising a “new progressive era” for New York City, has benefited from both falling crime rates and the declining numbers of police stops that followed the stop-and-frisk ruling. But critics say that the mayor continues to support policies — like the NYPD’s so-called precision policing and its sweeping gang investigations — that criminalize poor communities of color and contribute to mass incarceration.</p>

<p>“What we are seeing in the de Blasio era is that he has not only continued Bloomberg’s policies, but he has actually made them much more Orwellian and much more secretive,” said Josmar Trujillo, a community organizer who has advocated against the NYPD’s mass gang raids.</p>

<p>Howell warned against limiting demands for transparency to the gang database, highlighting the department’s shifting tactics. “If we say, you can’t keep a gang database, they will simply call it an intelligence database. Or move it into some algorithmic, predictive model and throw everything from everywhere into it,” said Howell. “What we really need to think about is, What is all this surveillance that the NYPD is doing? What is the limit on that surveillance?”</p>

<h2 id="newyorkgangprosecutionsuseconspiracychargestocriminalizewholecommunities">New York Gang Prosecutions Use Conspiracy Charges to Criminalize Whole Communities</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alice Speri</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/06/07/rico-gang-prosecution-nyc/ </p>

<p>Defendants like Carletto Allen are not supposed to go to trial. The 23-year old Bronx man was already in jail on a pending gun charge when hundreds of NYPD officers and federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives stormed a public housing project in the neighborhood where he lived with his grandmother and arrested dozens of his friends and neighbors.</p>

<p>The April 2016 raid, which authorities boasted was the “largest gang takedown in New York City history,” ended in 88 arrests and 120 indictments on federal conspiracy charges. The defendants — mostly young black and Latino men in their late teens or early 20s, whom police had surveilled for the better part of a decade — were listed in two separate indictments by their names and a variety of street aliases. Prosecutors said they were affiliated with two rival gangs connected to eight homicides that had occurred in the area since 2009, including that of a 92-year-old woman struck in her home by a stray bullet.</p>

<p>Like Allen, several of the defendants in the case were already behind bars at the time of the raid, some serving time after having been convicted in state court of the same crimes now being pursued by federal prosecutors. As The Intercept reported at the time, the Bronx raid, which followed a similar 2014 raid in Manhattan that led to 103 indictments, marked a shift by police and prosecutors toward mass conspiracy cases that see dozens of arrests and indictments quickly resolve in guilty pleas.</p>

<p>Defendants in these kinds of cases, often from New York City’s poorest neighborhoods, can’t afford to hire attorneys. The conspiracy charges they face — in the Bronx case, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, a federal law passed in 1970 to combat the Mafia — are broad and hard to fight, because proving individuals “conspired” with others accused of crimes is easier for prosecutors than proving they committed that crime. Threatened with draconian sentences, almost all defendants in these situations agree to plea deals — usually getting years rather decades in prison, and scoring prosecutors dozens of easy convictions.</p>

<p>“The government doesn’t have to do a lot of heavy lifting to prove that there was an alleged agreement between two people,” said Anthony Posada, supervising attorney with the Community Justice Unit at Legal Aid Society. “I think it’s very telling of the strategy that’s being used,” he added. “By using a statute that has very severe penalties, you sort of do this thing where you overcharge. … Large amounts of bail are set on people. And when you have bail set on you, you are more likely to take a plea, you are more likely to plead guilty to something, rather than to fight the matter.”</p>

<p>Prosecutors rely on that. Trying every single individual charged in connection with a mass raid would take years and cost the government millions. For the system to run efficiently, defendants can’t go to trial, and most don’t. Nationwide, 94 percent of felony convictions at the state level and 97 percent at the federal level are the result of plea bargains.</p>

<p>“Police and prosecutors know that people don’t go to trial and don’t fight these cases,” said Marne Lenox, an attorney at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund who worked at the Bronx Defenders at the time of the raid. “And for many of these individuals, the risk is far greater than the reward; once you get into federal court, you are facing mandatory minimums.”</p>

<p>Ninety-seven of the 103 individuals charged after the 2014 Manhattan raid — on state charges — entered guilty pleas. Of the 120 defendants charged following the Bronx raid, 110 have pleaded so far. Some 111 defendants had court-appointed attorneys, according to a recent presentation on the Bronx indictments by Babe Howell, a professor at the CUNY School of Law, and Priscilla Bustamante, a graduate student in critical psychology at CUNY Graduate Center. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York, which brought federal charges against those indicted in the Bronx raid, declined to comment.</p>

<p>Resisting the Pressure to Plea Out</p>

<p>Despite the pressure to plead guilty, Allen didn’t stick to the script. He is one of only two defendants in the Bronx case who chose to go trial. The second, Donque Tyrell, was tried last month on seven charges, including “aiding and abetting murder in aid of racketeering.” On Wednesday, a jury convicted him on all counts.</p>

<p>As Allen learned, tempting fate — and challenging the system — comes at a premium.</p>

<p>According to John Kenney, one of Allen’s attorneys, at the time of the raid, Allen had been in jail for just over a year after he was caught selling small quantities of marijuana to a police informant — “nickel bags on a corner,” as Kenney told The Intercept. Officers who were watching the transaction pulled Allen out of the car he was sitting in and said they found a gun in his pocket. Allen admitted that he sold marijuana but testified that the gun was in the pocket of a jacket on the car’s back seat, and not his. The officer who testified about the gun had substantiated complaints with the NYPD’s Internal Affairs Bureau and the Civilian Complaint Review Board, and he had been sued at least six times over excessive force, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution, settling each time — but prosecutors successfully blocked the defense from discussing the officer’s history at trial, on the grounds that it did not impact his “credibility.”</p>

<p>After the raid, Allen was moved to a federal jail downtown and saw his pending state charges balloon into federal counts of racketeering narcotics conspiracy, narcotics possession, and a firearms offense. In the mass indictment, his name was listed among dozens of “members and associates” of the “Big Money Bosses” gang, which prosecutors described as a “criminal organization” responsible for a string of serious crimes, including murder.</p>

<p>As they did following similar raids in other communities, prosecutors held a meeting with residents arguing that all the arrests were justified. “The lead prosecutor on the case would come out with the other detectives that investigated the matter, and they’d speak to community members in a very brief, sort of matter-of-fact way,” said Posada, whose group held forums for communities impacted by the raids. “This is what we did, and we did it in a very surgical way, and we refer to this as precision policing: We are precise in what we do so that we only get the worst and the worst out of the neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“The NYPD and the District Attorney’s Office tout these raids and the resulting large-scale indictments as an effective policing tool,” said Lenox. “But in truth, that’s an incredibly sanitized narrative that ignores the substantial harm that these takedowns inflict on communities of color and exaggerates the danger that arrested individuals pose to society.”</p>

<p>“The majority of people who are arrested in these takedowns are actually accused of having committed only low-level offenses and being engaged in low-level conduct,” she added. “But prosecutors rely on these conspiracy statutes to demonize individuals who commit petty offenses by implicating them in violent crime.”</p>

<p>Residents strongly objected to the narrative painted by prosecutors in the Bronx. Everyone living in a housing project was “associated” to everyone else, they argued, and the indictments accused dozens of people of crimes committed by a handful. “Are you going to lock up every black boy or Spanish boy who lives around here?” the mother of two young men arrested in the raid told The Intercept at the time. Still, with nearly all defendants taking pleas, nobody could challenge prosecutors’ allegations in court.</p>

<p>Like dozens of the men charged with him, Allen was offered a deal that would grant him close to time served — about three years at the time of the offer, according to Kenney. The attorney tried to convince him that taking the plea was in his best interest, but Allen rejected the idea and asked for a new attorney. In court, again over his attorneys’ objections, he insisted on testifying.</p>

<p>But if Allen had hoped trial would give him an opportunity to challenge the premise of a mass gang conspiracy, he was mistaken. “They didn’t try that case,” said Kenney. “They dropped everything except the marijuana and the gun.”</p>

<p>“They said, We’re not going to pursue murder, and all these other things, and narcotics sales except marijuana. We’re not talking about bank robbery; we’re not going to talk about all these things that were part of the conspiracy,” he added. “They just struck it from the indictment, so we never really got to the point.”</p>

<p>“They didn’t even allege he was a member of the gang,” he added, “which means they didn’t have any evidence.”</p>

<p>In their closing remarks, Allen’s attorneys tried to distinguish between the crimes he was accused of and the unproven allegations of a conspiracy, the very existence of which was never tested in court. “There is no evidence that you can rely upon … to suggest that he behaved in any way, shape, or form to promote the activities of that group in whatever shape or form that so-called BMB group existed,” attorneys told the jury, according to court transcripts. “Is it a [crime] to take a photograph that shows up on Facebook with a classmate of yours or a schoolmate of yours? Does that make him a member of a conspiracy?”</p>

<p>In the end, Allen was convicted of racketeering conspiracy, narcotics conspiracy, narcotics distribution, and a firearms offense. He faces up to a decade in prison, with a mandatory minimum of five years.</p>

<p>Allen, who is incarcerated at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan while awaiting sentencing, could not be reached for comment. His mother, Martha Allen, declined to talk about the case. “He gets slammed for the audacity of asking for his trial,” said Howell, the CUNY professor, who has studied the case. “If the police brought Carletto Allen all by himself to the federal prosecutor and said, We want to prosecute him for having a gun while selling marijuana in the street, they would look at this and say, That is not a federal case.”</p>

<p>The irony of Allen facing up to a decade in federal prison in connection with an incident stemming from a marijuana sale is that legalization is gaining fast traction in New York state and has become a central issue in the upcoming gubernatorial election. In New York City, where black and brown residents are arrested for marijuana possession at 10 times the rate of white residents, Mayor Bill de Blasio recently ordered police to stop arresting people for smoking marijuana in public. But the “gang” label — which critics say police and prosecutors use indiscriminately and without transparent criteria — precludes sympathy.</p>

<p>“The irony is that some people are taken aback by Trump’s comments about gang members as animals,” Josmar Trujillo, an organizer with the Coalition to End Broken Windows, told The Intercept referring to the president’s comment about members of the MS-13 gang. “In the most progressive city in America, the policies that actually treat people like animals and dehumanize them happen every day.”</p>

<p>“Mayor de Blasio has made gang policing one of his cornerstones of criminal justice reform; he talks about precision policing alongside boasts about the number of stop-and-frisks going down,” Trujillo added. “What he doesn’t mention is that this is exactly the point: He has shifted from low-level street harassment to high-level, complex, federally assisted arrests and prosecutions that actually much more impact and devastate communities of color.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see the point of bringing a RICO case against a guy who’s selling marijuana,” said Kenney, Allen’s attorney, calling his client’s ordeal “a case of massive overcharging.”</p>

<p>Still, he warned of the risks that defendants incur when challenging the system. “The reason people plead guilty is because it makes sense.”</p>

<p id="byline">by: Michael Isaac Stein</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-06</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/03/06/new-orleans-surveillance-cameras-nopd-police/ </p>

<p>As you walk down Felicity Street in the Central City neighborhood of New Orleans, red and blue flashing lights radiate from around the corner. But when you turn on to South Liberty Street, you won’t find a patrol car. Your gaze will rise to the peak of a street lamp where the lights are fastened to an NOPD surveillance camera that, just like the lights, runs 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>The beams engulf the small, seven-house block, reflecting off the windows of cars and homes, ricocheting off the bicycles of kids riding by, and lighting up the cheeks of Keisha Smith, who sits on her stoop eating crawfish. “I hate those lights,” she says. “There’s no privacy for us now. Everyone’s uncomfortable. I feel like somebody’s always watching me.” She looks up at the camera and shivers. “Why’d they have to put those here? It’s like trauma when I see that red and blue.”</p>

<p>This camera is just one of an unknown number that the city installed over the past few months, part of Mayor Mitch Landrieu’s $40 million public safety plan which the American Civil Liberties Union has condemned as “surveillance on steroids.” The plan also includes new license plate readers and a controversial city ordinance that requires the installation of cameras on the outside of all bars and liquor stores.</p>

<p>The plan has endured criticism about its high cost and the lack of evidence that surveillance programs are an effective crime prevention strategy. Still others have worried that the Big Easy’s free-wheeling spirit and eccentricity will wane under the perpetual gaze of the police.</p>

<p>But more concerning is the public safety plan’s ambiguous purpose and the potential for abuse. It seems that the only oversight will come from the city’s Office of Homeland Security and from within the police department itself, which is currently under a federal consent decree for a myriad of violations including “a pattern of stops, searches, and arrests that violate the Fourth Amendment.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the New Orleans Police Department insisted that the department had controls on access to its systems, and that all activity on the system is logged and monitored, leaving an audit trail in cases of abuse. But beyond that, the department has failed to answer basic questions about how the cameras will be used, what technology it will incorporate, how long the footage will be stored, and who will have access to the footage.</p>

<p>The lack of details has sparked anxiety among the city’s undocumented immigrants, who fear that the new data will fall into the hands of the city’s exceptionally aggressive Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office.</p>

<p>But in the most incarcerated city in the most incarcerated state in the country, where black communities endure the brunt of police power, the most salient concern is how this powerful tool could exacerbate the city’s already racially disparate law enforcement.</p>

<p>Ursula Price, deputy police monitor at the New Orleans’ Independent Police Monitor’s Office, told The Intercept that the surveillance isn’t just a threat to individual black people, it compromises the essence of black communities at large. “Coming from Mississippi, one of the things I love about New Orleans is how black people occupy public space here. In Mississippi, you gather privately. But here, with second line culture, with stoop culture, black people are always occupying public space. This is a threat to all of that.”</p>

<p>The plan was developed largely in the shadows and the cameras were installed with little public debate.</p>

<p>Landrieu introduced it to the public in January 2017, less than two months after a high-profile shooting on Bourbon Street grabbed national and international headlines. New Orleans has long had one of the highest homicide rates in the country, an affliction that Landrieu has consistently approached with genuine empathy and frustration. But in a city driven by tourism, the misfortune of visitors is what often precipitates action.</p>

<p>“We’re sending a message to the millions of people who visit New Orleans every single year,” said Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards, who came to New Orleans for the plan’s unveiling. “It’s important they know New Orleans is safe. New Orleans is open for business, and we want them all to come here to experience all that New Orleans and Louisiana have to offer.”</p>

<p>Both he and the mayor insist that the cameras are not just there to satiate nervous tourists. The surveillance, they say, is for the well-being of the people who live here. But it seems the only New Orleans civilians who had a hand in the plan’s formulation were representatives from the tourism and service industries. With zero public hearings, the plan wasn’t brought to public light for input and discussion before its implementation. The Independent Police Monitor was neither consulted nor warned, and according to NOPD Communications Director Beau Tidwell, the Federal Consent Decree Monitor wasn’t involved in the plan’s construction either. (The head of the monitoring team, Jonathan Aronie, said he wasn’t allowed to talk to the press.)</p>

<p>“This is the fundamental problem with policing in America,” says Price. “It’s been outside democracy for years.”</p>

<p>New Orleans’ surveillance program, like most others, was rationalized with national security and terrorist threats. The NOPD received gun-sniffing dogs and new patrol rifles for active shooter scenarios, and bollards were installed in the French Quarter to stop terrorists from driving through crowds.</p>

<p>But the central part of the plan, the component that ate up the majority of its funding, was an enigmatic blueprint for an extensive web of surveillance.</p>

<p>Last November, the city opened the Real Time Crime Monitoring Center, an impressive facility with wall-to-wall screens, dual monitor computers, men in headsets – all the trimmings of a Hollywood action set.</p>

<p>“If you’re in public, you do not have an expectation of privacy,” Landrieu said at the center’s grand opening. “I think that’s just the new day in age that we’re in, and people should conduct themselves accordingly.”</p>

<p>The monitoring center is managed by the New Orleans Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, but it’s primarily a tool for the NOPD. “We are going to demonstrate that we will see you, we will know who you are, we will be able to apprehend you,” said Police Superintendent Michael S. Harrison, at the opening.</p>

<p>Landrieu announced that the city had installed 80 cameras around New Orleans and planned to install 250 more by spring 2018. He also announced the installation of over 100 license plate readers. But this was just an appetizer.</p>

<p>The main course is an unprecedented city ordinance that the mayor is trying to push through city council that would require every business that sells alcohol to put cameras on the outside of their buildings, feeding live footage into the monitoring center. The surreptitious ordinance is only one sentence long, but it’s consequences would be massive, introducing dragnet video surveillance to New Orleans, which has more bars per capita than any other major American city.</p>

<p>The New Orleans City Council deferred voting on the ordinance at their February 10 meeting after the Louisiana Restaurant Association, a powerful state lobbying group, raised concerns about how it would affect their industry with the mayor’s office. It’s unclear when the ordinance will return to City Council for a vote, although The Advocate reported that it’s expected to come this month.</p>

<p>The NOPD has neither publicly enumerated nor set a limit to the permissible uses of surveillance footage. And some of the public safety plan’s promises are ominously vague. For example, it says that the crime monitoring center will allow the NOPD to “deter violence before it erupts,” as well as allow officers “to proactively focus on suspicious activity” and “increase their likelihood of an arrest from reasonable suspicion.”</p>

<p>For Price, this language raises alarms. The NOPD’s history of racist policing is as well-documented as it is tragic. “The limited arrest data that the department collects points to racial disparities in arrests of whites and African Americans in virtually all categories,” says a 2011 report by Department of Justice. These asymmetrical arrest rates are among the reasons that one in seven black men from New Orleans is either in prison, on parole, or on probation. They were also cited by the Department of Justice as justifications for the NOPD’s consent decree, which has been active since 2012.</p>

<p>Another concern for black New Orleanians is how the cameras will be used to identify and capture suspects. At the opening of the crime monitoring center, the head of the city’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, Aaron Miller, laid out a fictional example of how this might go. “We’re looking for an individual who just robbed a bank who may be wearing a gray sweater.” That description would go directly to the Monitoring Center’s technicians, who would scan live footage to identify those who match it and direct patrols accordingly.</p>

<p>Insert “black man in their mid-20s” for “gray sweater,” and you find a problem. Black men are much more likely to be misidentified as suspects by the police, according to the ACLU. Even the FBI’s facial recognition software is less accurate when trying to identify black suspects. Interactions between the NOPD and black people aren’t always benign, and increasing their frequency is dangerous, given that police are much more likely to subject black suspects to excessive and deadly force, according to the DOJ report.</p>

<p>“The NOPD has come a long way, but this is jumping the gun,” Price says. “To provide such an invasive tool without assuring the public that tool will be regulated is disturbing.”</p>

<p>The mayor’s initiative also comes during a period of heightened anxiety about immigration enforcement within New Orleans’ undocumented community.</p>

<p>ICE has ramped up detention and deportations throughout the U.S. since Donald Trump’s inauguration, but in the Deep South, this intensification is particularly stark. ICE’s New Orleans Field Office increased deportations by 98 percent from 2016 to 2017, according to numbers provided by Thomas Byrd, the field office’s Public Affairs Officer.</p>

<p>“First and foremost, what really scares us is that we don’t know who’s going to have access, like ICE,” says Rocio, an undocumented immigrant and member organizer for Congreso de Jornaleros, an immigrant advocacy organization in New Orleans. She asked that her last name be omitted for fear of deportation.</p>

<p>Particularly concerning for the city’s undocumented immigrants are the city’s new license plate readers, given that ICE recently announced a massive expansion of its ability to track license plates across the country.</p>

<p>Both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Landrieu agree that New Orleans is not a sanctuary city, although it does have rules that the NOPD cannot inquire about a person’s immigration status and won’t detain undocumented immigrants at ICE’s request. However, it’s not clear that any NOPD rules prevent ICE from getting information from the real-time monitoring center. When asked what federal authorities will have access to the cameras, Tidwell said only that “access and sharing of the footage is governed by NOPD policy.”</p>

<p>For Rocio, the city’s failure to protect her community, or even acknowledge the danger of this surveillance, is disappointing but unsurprising.</p>

<p>“In saying that they’re doing this for the city, they’re leaving out key parts of the city,” Rocio said. “We don’t feel safer with these cameras. People are losing their partners, living without their husbands after they’re deported. What happens to these kids if their mother is deported too? I fear for my family, for my friends.” Rocio wipes tears from her eyes. Her own husband was detained by ICE a year and a half ago, she says, leaving her to raise her two children on her own.</p>

<p>Members of city council have remained reticent or completely silent as the debate stirs; the only voice from City Hall to explicitly acknowledge the potential for racially disproportionate impacts is Council President Jason Williams. “Broad surveillance networks have potential to be misused and to target vulnerable, immigrant communities and people of color,” he wrote in an emailed statement to The Intercept. “All of these proposals raise serious civil liberty, privacy rights, and constitutional concerns, while it is still certainly unclear how these measures will reduce criminal activity and increase public safety.”</p>

<p>Alfred Morris, a racial equity activist, says that if the mayor wants a safer city, he should invest in education and affordable housing, not new surveillance cameras, on Feb. 23, 2018, outside of the New Orleans City Hall.</p>

<p>Landrieu has waved off questions about his plan’s legality as puerile. His proclamations have been terse and unbending, insisting that this type of surveillance has been “black letter constitutional law for some period of time.”</p>

<p>Not everyone agrees. Marc J. Blitz, a law professor at Oklahoma University School of Law, says that because the Supreme Court has never adjudicated a challenge to public video surveillance, it’s hard to say for sure whether the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches puts constraints on public video surveillance. “I and other academics would argue that the Fourth Amendment should cover this stuff, given the power of this surveillance,” he told The Intercept.</p>

<p>When a camera is simply feeding live footage of public space to the police, this is more or less equivalent to an officer standing and observing in public, and wouldn’t be a Fourth Amendment violation, according to Blitz. But when the cameras are bolstered with increasingly advanced technology, questions of constitutionality arise.</p>

<p>In a 2013 article for the American University Law Review, Blitz argued that surveillance becomes a search when the footage is recorded. “By transforming ephemeral occurrences into permanent records, recording allows government officials to search public lives frame by frame, much like they might search documents file by file,” he wrote. Others have made the case that high-tech surveillance, such as face-recognition software and high-definition magnification, could impinge on the Fourth Amendment even in public spaces, if it illuminates what is otherwise imperceptible to the human eye. It could also have a chilling effect on First Amendment-protected activities, such as protests and other public gatherings.</p>

<p>New Orleans has repeatedly illustrated its willingness to embrace high-tech surveillance. The city has previously suggested installing infrared cameras to see if people are carrying weapons under their clothes. The NOPD stores its camera footage with Axon (formerly Taser), a company that claims to be creating artificial intelligence applications that can detect emotion and “anticipate criminal activity.” The Verge recently reported that New Orleans, without the knowledge of City Council or the public, has had a contract with Palantir since 2012 for a predictive policing program that uses data-mining and social network analysis to try to identify criminal activity.</p>

<p>The NOPD’s Tidwell said that the city doesn’t currently have facial recognition software. When asked what technology New Orleans’ new cameras will use, he declined to say. “We would prefer not to comment on specifics,” he said in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>Blitz also pointed out that the Constitution is not a complete enumeration of the rights to which people are entitled. Even if the Fourth Amendment doesn’t apply, he says, localities, through legislatures and city councils, can decide for themselves what level of state surveillance they’re willing to tolerate. New Orleanians could still push back.</p>

<p>Correction: March 20, 2018, 5:44 p.m</p>

<p>An earlier version of this article stated that Axon claimed to be creating facial recognition software. Although company executives have hinted at the development of such technology, a company spokesperson said that Axon’s technology “is not meant to be integrated with facial recognition software.”</p>

<h2 id="transparencyadvocateswinreleaseofnypdpredictivepolicingdocuments">Transparency Advocates Win Release of NYPD “Predictive Policing” Documents</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ali Winston</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-26</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/27/nypd-predictive-policing-documents-lawsuit-crime-forecasting-brennan/ </p>

<p>Late last month, a Manhattan judge ordered the New York City Police Department to release documentation about the department’s use of secretive and highly controversial “predictive policing” surveillance technology, scoring a win for advocates of transparency on police policy. The documents came to light as part of a lawsuit against the city filed by the Brennan Center for Justice, a New York-based policy institute.</p>

<p>Little is known about how the largest domestic police force in the United States uses crime-forecasting software, which works through analysis of historical crime data like arrest records, incident reports, gang documentation, and “stop and frisk” encounters to generate individual or geographic predictions of crime. In July 2015, then-NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton branded predictive policing as “the wave of the future” and entered into a trial program with at least one predictive policing company, the Philadelphia-based Azavea.</p>

<p>“The ‘Minority Report’ of 2002 is the reality of today,” said Bratton. “There are no secrets. There are none. If two people share a piece of information, it is no longer secret.”</p>

<p>While Azavea’s pilot program with the NYPD was publicly announced, documents obtained by the Brennan Center through its lawsuit and shared with The Intercept show two more companies were brought in to try out their crime-forecasting approaches — the Bronxville, New York-based KeyStat Inc. and PredPol, a Santa Cruz, California-based company. PredPol has positioned itself as an early market leader in predictive policing with a highly publicized — but dubiously effective — geographic prediction model derived from battlefield research in Iraq. All three companies were granted 45-day trials to show the NYPD what their predictive policing software could do.</p>

<p>The original request for documentation was filed by the Brennan Center in June 2016 under New York’s Freedom of Information Law. After the NYPD rejected the initial request and subsequent appeal, the Brennan Center filed suit on August 30, 2017. The NYPD is notorious for its intransigence on open records requests from the press and the public, particularly concerning documentation about the department’s extensive use of surveillance technology. In recent years, lawsuits have been filed to disclose information about the department’s network of surveillance cameras, its use of X-ray scanners in public, and the deployment of facial recognition technology.</p>

<p>In a December 22, 2017, order, Judge Barbara Jaffe rejected the NYPD’s arguments that disclosure of documentation related to the forecasting trials was exempt due to laws in New York that allow the government to shield investigative and trade secrets. “That the venders entered into nondisclosure agreements with NYPD does not prove that disclosure would cause substantial injury to any of the vendors’ competitive position,” Jaffe wrote in her order.</p>

<p>Jaffe also rejected the NYPD’s argument that disclosure of training and output data from its predictive policing trials would endanger the department’s computer security. She mandated the production of notes on the predictive policing system maintained by Evan Levine, the NYPD’s assistant commissioner of data analytics.</p>

<p>“Absent expert advice that the disclosure of the output data and Levine’s notes would jeopardize the NYPD’s capacity to guarantee the security of its information assets, respondents fail to sustain their burden as to the applicability of this exemption to such data and notes,” the order reads.</p>

<p>The Brennan Center will also file a new freedom of information request to obtain the source data used by the NYPD companies to train the department’s current, in-house predictive policing algorithm. In other cities, researchers have used such information to re-engineer crime-forecasting programs, revealing that they disproportionately impact communities of color.</p>

<p>The release of the documents will be the public’s first chance to learn about the NYPD’s application of the crime-forecasting program in day-to-day police work.</p>

<p>Rachel Levinson-Waldman, a staff attorney at the Brennan Center who filed the original freedom of information request, said in an interview that the release of the documents, thanks to the court’s decision, will be the public’s first chance to learn about the NYPD’s application of the crime-forecasting program in day-to-day police work. Even though the NYPD ended up building its own in-house predictive policing algorithm, the release of correspondence and training data from its trials with KeyStat, PredPol, and Azavea will still offer insight into the department’s objectives.</p>

<p>“One reason it’s important to get those materials, even though NYPD built own predictive policing program, is it tells us a lot in terms of what NYPD wanted to accomplish,” Levinson-Waldman said.</p>

<p>Through the litigation process, the Brennan Center has also learned that no privacy or use policy exists that governs the NYPD’s use of predictive policing. In response to the request for policies and oversight regulations, NYPD released a 9-year-old privacy policy governing the Domain Awareness System, a massive, citywide network of CCTV cameras, gunshot and explosive detection sensors, and license-plate readers.</p>

<p>“The Domain Awareness System is a network of surveillance technology that covers all of New York City, especially Manhattan,” said Levinson-Waldman. “It has nothing to do with predictive policing.”</p>

<p>Moreover, even if the Domain Awareness System’s guidelines are the governing regulations for the NYPD’s predictive policing program, the department has never conducted an audit of the software, as required by the policy. “We didn’t receive any audits in response to our record request, which seems incredibly inappropriate since this program has been in place for several years,” said Levinson-Waldman.</p>

<p>The NYPD did not respond to requests for comment on Jaffe’s decision or the department’s oversight of its use of crime-forecasting software.</p>

<p>The disclosure of information about the NYPD’s crime-forecasting initiatives comes at a moment of increased scrutiny for the surveillance programs of the country’s largest police department. Late last year, the city council passed legislation to create a task force charged with reviewing municipal programs that used algorithms or machine learning for decision-making. A separate bill would have established a transparency and public comment process for the NYPD’s acquisition of surveillance.</p>

<h2 id="caughtinagangdragnetanddetainedbyiceanimmigrantteststhelimitsofasanctuarycity">Caught in a Gang Dragnet and Detained by ICE, an Immigrant Tests the Limits of a Sanctuary City</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Maryam Saleh</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-27</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/28/chicago-gangs-immigration-ice/ </p>

<p>Wilmer Catalan-Ramirez awoke one morning in March to find two men wearing jackets emblazoned with the word “police” standing over his bed. They tugged at his blanket and pointed a flashlight onto his face. Catalan-Ramirez, who had been partially paralyzed in a drive-by shooting two months earlier, hobbled out of bed and into the living room of his house. There, he found another four officers standing with his wife, Celene Adame.</p>

<p>The officers had first shown up outside the couple’s house in Chicago’s Back of the Yards neighborhood earlier that morning, as Adame was taking their children to school. She turned the officers away, but found them still outside when she returned. Again, she asked them to leave. Adame could hear her 3-year-old son crying as she went in to the apartment and found more officers inside. One of them asked Adame where the guns and drugs were. “What guns or drugs?” she replied.</p>

<p>After Catalan-Ramirez, a 32-year-old Guatemalan native who lacks proper immigration documents, came into the living room, the men asked the couple for identification. Adame, assuming they were police officers, gave them her husband’s birth certificate and a copy of his passport. Adame repeatedly asked the officers if they had a warrant, who they were, and what they were looking for. They gave no answers. (This account of the morning is based on filings Catalan-Ramirez made in a suit he later brought against several local and federal officials and agencies.)</p>

<p>Three officers — of the six in total inside the house — moved to surround Catalan-Ramirez. He told them in English that he was sick, still recovering from the drive-by shooting. He had fractured his skull and right shoulder, leaving him with a traumatic brain injury and partial paralysis on his left side. According to his testimony in court documents, he asked the officers to handcuff him in the front if they intended to arrest him, but two officers nonetheless wrenched his arms behind his back. Because of Catalan-Ramirez’s partial paralysis, his left arm was difficult to maneuver, so the officers slammed him to the floor. Three of them pinned him; one kneeled on his back.</p>

<p>“You are breaking my arm!” Catalan-Ramirez shouted in Spanish. The officers responded by slamming his head on the floor. At some point, Adame grabbed her phone and began to record the encounter, ignoring the officers’ requests that she stop. Eventually, the officers took Catalan-Ramirez out to their car and drove him to a hospital, where a doctor confirmed that his other shoulder was now also fractured.</p>

<p>Catalan-Ramirez’s next stop was a field office for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — he’d mistaken ICE agents for police. At no point did the agents ask Catalan-Ramirez about his immigration status nor did he offer them any information. ICE asked if Catalan-Ramirez was affiliated with a gang, and he told them “no.” He was eventually transferred to immigration detention, where he began parallel legal battles to stop his deportation and to get answers about why he had been the target of the violent raid.</p>

<p>Last week, after 10 months in ICE custody, Catalan-Ramirez was released to his family, his deportation put off for the time being. His odyssey, however, shows how local law enforcement initiatives can become intertwined with federal immigration agencies to ensnare people — even as cities like Chicago declare themselves sanctuaries for the undocumented.</p>

<p>Catalan-Ramirez, the father of two U.S.-born children, is a longtime Chicago resident who, until his arrest, fixed trailers at a body shop. The city is a hotbed of gang activity, but he says he has never been affiliated with a criminal gang. Chicago police officers have a different opinion, however, having added Catalan-Ramirez to the police department’s gang database. It is that listing that led to Catalan-Ramirez’s violent arrest in a March 27 ICE anti-gang operation. In fact, Catalan-Ramirez alleges, an ICE agent said the Chicago Police Department had given federal immigration authorities a tip that he was affiliated with a Chicago street gang.</p>

<p>Catalan-Ramirez sued ICE, claiming his warrantless arrest from his home was unconstitutional. He also sued the city of Chicago and the city’s police department, accusing them of violating his due process rights by adding him to the gang database without notifying him or giving him a chance to challenge his inclusion on the list. After reaching a settlement with Chicago in December – in which the police department admitted that it couldn’t verify that he is a gang member — he dropped the lawsuit against the city and its police department. In January, ICE agreed to release Catalan-Ramirez from detention under an order of supervision, and Catalan-Ramirez withdrew his suit against the agency as well.</p>

<p>In a statement to The Intercept, the Chicago police denied tipping off ICE about Catalan-Ramirez. ICE declined to comment on the allegation.</p>

<p>Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has positioned himself as a staunch protector of immigrants’ rights, and the Chicago Police Department maintains that it does not cooperate with federal immigration authorities and “does not share any information or communicate with ICE regarding our database.” Catalan-Ramirez’s case, however, makes clear that ICE is getting information collected by police somehow and using it in enforcement operations. Is Chicago, then, truly a sanctuary for unauthorized immigrants?</p>

<p>There is no set definition for a sanctuary city, and policies vary widely across the country. Among so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, a carve-out for people with a warrant or violent criminal conviction is common. Only a handful of local governments, however, have policies with exceptions for individuals thought to be affiliated with a gang. A DHS list of nearly 150 jurisdictions that have restricted cooperation with ICE lists only four jurisdictions that explicitly preclude identified gang members from protection: Connecticut; Middlesex County, New Jersey; Milwaukee; and Chicago. (DHS stopped publishing its name-and-shame list of jurisdictions that decline detainer requests in April, after several law enforcement agencies complained they were wrongly included.)</p>

<p>The Windy City has provided some level of sanctuary to immigrants since 1985, when Mayor Harold Washington, by executive order, gave all Chicago residents “regardless of nationality or citizenship” equal access to municipal benefits and directed city officials not to ask about or assist in the investigation of an individual’s citizenship status, except as required by federal law. In 2006, the Chicago City Council codified the policies into a “Welcoming City Ordinance,” noting that requiring or promoting local enforcement of immigration laws would harm public safety if victims or witnesses feared deportation if they spoke to police. Emanuel spearheaded an expansion of the ordinance in 2012, making it city policy not to detain individuals suspected of immigration-related offenses at the behest of federal authorities.</p>

<p>Emanuel’s move came with a catch. The expanded Welcoming City Ordinance has four exceptions for people thought by the city to pose a threat to public safety: those with an outstanding criminal warrant, a felony conviction, pending felony charges, or identification as a known gang member.</p>

<p>As it stands, these exceptions come into play only when an individual is arrested or otherwise detained by Chicago police. In Catalan-Ramirez’s case, there was no interaction with local law enforcement that triggered his arrest by immigration agents. ICE showed up at his home unannounced. And, according to his lawyers, it was because police had told immigration authorities that he belonged to a criminal gang.</p>

<p>The way police transmit gang information to ICE “is kind of a black box. It’s hard to know, and, of course, they’re not going to tell you,” said Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.</p>

<p>“This loophole is a problem, insofar as it does affect individuals who may be in the gang database by mistake or may have had previous gang affiliation,” he said. It also ensnares people who “may not have done anything to engage in any kind of criminal activity, even if they are identified as having a gang relationship.”</p>

<p>The closest thing to a public record of who is in the gang database is the CPD’s Strategic Subject List, which uses an algorithm to predict who will be involved in gun violence. The department released a redacted version of the list, which includes a column on gang affiliation, to the Chicago Sun-Times in May in response to a lawsuit. The University of Illinois at Chicago’s Policing in Chicago Research Group analyzed the list and found that it includes nearly 65,000 Chicago residents as gang-affiliated; 74.5 percent of them are black, and 21.4 percent are Latino. Notably, the University of Illinois researchers found, 67.5 percent of the people identified as “gang-affiliated” on the list have never been arrested for violent offenses or unlawful use of a weapon.</p>

<p>Chicago’s database is of a piece with the decadeslong trend of urban police departments around the country operating specialized anti-gang units. Forty percent of local law enforcement offices surveyed by the National Gang Center in 2011 had such a unit, and more than three-quarters of those offices maintained intelligence on local gang activities. Eighty-four percent of local law enforcement agencies that gathered intelligence on gang affiliation in 2011 stored that data in an electronic system.</p>

<p>Gang databases essentially criminalize non-criminal activity, said Lena Graber, an attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center who focuses on immigration enforcement by local police. “What gang identification does is that it says we don’t have to have evidence that you’ve committed a crime or broken the law — we’re going to stop short of the Fourth Amendment and charging you with a crime and add you to this database that has criminal justice consequences without any due process,” she told The Intercept.</p>

<p>The problems are compounded when there are immigration consequences for gang identification, Graber added, particularly under the Trump administration. “We currently have a vociferously anti-immigrant government and a federal agency that is constantly demonizing immigrants and using fear around gangs to scapegoat immigrants and make them sound like an enemy,” Graber said.</p>

<p>Another attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, Angie Junck, said the focus on gangs reinforced racial and ethnic biases in government responses to immigration issues. “Over-inclusiveness” — putting too many people into gang databases — “is a direct gateway of why immigration enforcement is racial profiling and disproportionately affects communities of color that are more likely to have gang issues,” she said.</p>

<p>The process by which Chicago’s specialized gang unit collects information and adds it to the database is opaque. The criteria for gang membership is subjective. “Gangs can be identified by what they wear, graffiti they display, and hand signals that they gesture,” according to the police department’s website. Rank-and-file police officers are empowered to make calls on who to include.</p>

<p>A scathing Department of Justice investigation into the Chicago Police Department — the results of which were released last January — found that many black and Latino residents of high-crime neighborhoods find that they are suspected of criminal activity or gang membership based solely on appearance. “As one Latino resident stated, ‘There is guilt by association,’” according to the investigation. “Latinos stated that there is a tendency for officers to ‘lump everyone together.’”</p>

<p>Chicago police added Catalan-Ramirez to their gang database twice, according to court documents. The first time, in June 2015, came after a run-in with two cops in his neighborhood. The officers approached Catalan-Ramirez while he was outside his neighbor’s home in Back of the Yards. “He was loitering with another individual in a known Latin Saint street gang/narcotic area,” the officers said, according to Chicago police records. Catalan-Ramirez contends that he was merely spending time outside with his friends and their children. Unbeknownst to Catalan-Ramirez, the officers labeled him a Latin Saints gang member and added his name to the gang database.</p>

<p>Then, in November 2016, two other police officers pulled Catalan-Ramirez over when he was driving a few blocks from his home, allegedly for failing to stop at a stop sign. They arrested him for that offense and for driving on a suspended license, and added him to the gang database as a member of the Satan Disciples — even though the Latin Saints and Satan Disciples are rival gangs.</p>

<p>The four Chicago cops “all wrongly assumed Mr. Catalan-Ramirez was a gang member because he was a young Latino who lived in a neighborhood that was considered to be gang territory,” Catalan-Ramirez’s lawyers argued in their initial legal complaint against the city.</p>

<p>According to the lawsuit, Catalan-Ramirez has never been a Chicago street gang member, and the police did not notify him about his inclusion in the gang database or give him an opportunity to contest it. The lack of transparency surrounding the database was the basis of Catalan-Ramirez’s claim that his due process rights were violated. “If someone is saying false allegations against you, you have a right to challenge those allegations, because if those false allegations are used against you and you’re deprived of your liberty, you have a right to challenge that false allegation,” Vanessa del Valle, Catalan-Ramirez’s lawyer at Northwestern University’s MacArthur Justice Center, told The Intercept.</p>

<p>It’s not clear, though, that Catalan-Ramirez’s due process suit would have been successful if it had proceeded. There are two types of precedent for challenging government databases, and the facts of Catalan-Ramirez’s case don’t quite fit either of them, said Aziz Huq, a constitutional law professor at the University of Chicago. In one set of cases, individuals challenge their inclusion on a government list because it harms their reputation, as in a 1976 case in which police distributed “active shoplifter” fliers pointing to a man against whom shoplifting charges were later dropped. The man sued the police, but the Supreme Court eventually ruled that his constitutional right to privacy had not been violated. In other words, Huq said, the court declared that “the due process clause does not protect your reputation.”</p>

<p>In the other type of cases, a government-run list is used for some sort of coercive government action, like the federal government’s no-fly list restricting access to air travel. Challenges to these lists have been moving through federal courts but have not yet reached the Supreme Court. Huq said that the no-fly list and Chicago police’s gang database are not exactly comparable: With the Chicago gang database, the body creating the list — the police department — is separate from the entity using it, ICE. And in watch-list cases, the government asserts that it has the right to deny people access to travel without any reason at all. In the gang database context, Huq said, the government does claim a legal basis for listing someone, even if it’s not always a persuasive one.</p>

<p>Catalan-Ramirez’s lawyers at the MacArthur Justice Center have filed a separate lawsuit challenging the gang database on behalf of Luis Pedrote-Salinas, whose parents brought him to the United States as a child and who is now in removal proceedings. The city has moved to dismiss that lawsuit, arguing in part that even if police did inaccurately label Pedrote-Salinas as a gang member, “due process provides no guarantee against police errors.” The city did not specifically address the allegation that the police department shares information from its gang database with ICE, but it did emphasize its “strong interest in maintaining information about gang affiliations.” That lawsuit is ongoing and is anti-gang database activists’ best chance at lifting the veil on the process of collecting and disseminating gang information.</p>

<p>The outcome of the case may depend on whether the court finds that the sharing of information between CPD and ICE is unlawful. “I find it hard to believe that a city like Chicago doesn’t have an interest in acquiring that information. That seems unlikely,” Huq said. “Then the question is, does that person have an interest in challenging it? Well, it depends on how the information is being used.”</p>

<p>In 2015, several immigrants’ rights groups in Chicago coalesced to form the Chicago Immigration Policy Working Group, which advocates for increased protections for immigrants. Their lobbying led to a 2016 amendment to the city’s sanctuary law that prohibits all city employees, including police officers, from asking about an individual’s immigration status or threatening deportation. Last year, the focus of their work turned to eliminating the exceptions to the Welcoming City Ordinance, which they think is critical to positive community-police relations.</p>

<p>“The perception that Chicago is a welcoming city, that people should feel free to call police — that actually isn’t true,” said Van Huynh, a staff attorney at the West Suburban Action Project, which is part of the working group. “We know that it’s difficult for community folks to see the difference between ICE agents and police officers. Even though the city says they’re not cooperating with ICE, that’s essentially not true because police officers have the discretion to hand over individuals.”</p>

<p>For a while, it seemed the city was being responsive to the working group’s concerns. The mayor’s office was cooperating with the group and considering an amendment to the sanctuary law that would eliminate the carve-outs in the Welcoming City Ordinance, according to advocates working on the issue. But in August, when the city sued the Justice Department over a plan to withhold federal public safety grants to jurisdictions with so-called sanctuary policies, the cooperation — and the prospect of an amendment to the ordinance — came to an end.</p>

<p>Emails obtained by The Intercept show that Tania Unzueta, policy and legal director at Mijente, wrote to Seemi Choudry, director of the Mayor’s Office of New Americans and asked for a meeting to discuss the city’s lawsuit against the Trump administration. Unzueta included a handful of queries. “At the top of the list is why you would tell us that the city does not want to call more attention from the Trump administration by changing the ordinance, and then go ahead and sue the Department of Justice?” Unzueta wrote. “If things have changed, can we move on getting rid of the carve outs now, and have an ordinance that we are proud to defend?”</p>

<p>Choudry rebuffed the questions. “As for scheduling a meeting to discuss the Welcoming City Ordinance, we are not a position to discuss amendments to the ordinance as we are now in litigation with the federal government,” Choudry wrote back. “I am happy to discuss this further with you over the phone.”</p>

<p>In a subsequent phone conversation, according to Unzueta, Choudry changed her tone and said that her inability to discuss the ordinance was not necessarily linked to the lawsuit, but that there was no point in continuing to talk if neither side was willing to budge.</p>

<p>Asked about Unzueta’s account, Emanuel’s office declined to comment on the emails but issued a statement in support of its lawsuit. “Our welcoming city protections are strong enough that they’re being targeted by the Trump administration, and we’re in court right now over them,” the statement said. “But even with the Trump Administration targeting Chicago under its unlawful attack, we will not be bullied into giving up our values.”</p>

<p>Chicago’s lawsuit against the administration is rooted in Trump’s executive order commanding federal agencies to withhold funds from sanctuary cities — including funding under a federal grant program that has supported the police for years. A U.S. District Court judge in September granted a preliminary injunction that bars the Justice Department from requiring sanctuary cities to cooperate with immigration agents in exchange for grant money, and the lawsuit is ongoing.</p>

<p>While immigrants’ rights advocates say they support efforts to push back against the Trump administration’s anti-immigration policies, they don’t think Emanuel’s boisterous defiance of the federal government aligns with the city’s policies. “The mayor has increased his national public image to say he stands with immigrants, but the reality for immigrants hasn’t changed,” Huynh said. “From a national perspective, it’s great that they’re filing this lawsuit. From a local perspective, there’s not much being done.”</p>

<p>In August, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner signed the Illinois Trust Act, under which law enforcement officers across the state cannot ask individuals about their immigration status or hold them without a warrant. Rauner, a Republican, held the signing ceremony at a Mexican restaurant in Little Village, a predominately Latino neighborhood in Chicago. He stood in front of a wall of colorful murals and told a room full of law enforcement, immigration advocates, and journalists that the decision to sign the law was a difficult one. “There are many people who don’t want me to sign this bill,” he said, “but I am very pro-immigration. I’ve been pro-immigration my whole life. I have been very pro-comprehensive immigration reform for my whole life.” The police officers he conferred with told him that the law would “help us keep our communities safer,” the governor added.</p>

<p>The statewide law has no exceptions, making it more protective than Chicago’s sanctuary law. Still, lawmakers on one side and advocates and legal experts on the other disagree about whether it has any impact on the city in which it was signed.</p>

<p>Under the Illinois Constitution, any municipality with a population of at least 25,000 is a “home rule” unit of government, which means it has the power to make its own laws. In 2013, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that ordinances enacted by municipalities — like Chicago’s Welcoming City one — trump subsequent state statutes, unless the Illinois legislature expressly exercises exclusive control. State lawmakers did not write an exception in the Trust Act, spurring some to believe that it does not supersede Chicago’s law. For those advocating to change Chicago’s policy, that makes all the difference. “It’s a little ironic that the state under a Republican governor has a much more progressive policy than this Democratic mayor in a metropolitan area,” Huynh said.</p>

<p>The Trust Act’s chief sponsor was Sen. John Cullerton, a Democrat who represents the state Senate’s 6th District. When asked whether the General Assembly considered including an exception in the law to overpower ordinances like Chicago’s, John Patterson, a spokesperson from Cullerton’s office, told The Intercept that the Trust Act applies statewide: It is a base policy that municipalities can go beyond in terms of offering protection to immigrants, he said. Chicago’s law, of course, does exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>Cullerton’s office does think the Trust Act should be imposed on Chicago. In a written statement after the initial interview, Patterson said that the law did not require an exception because “enforcement of federal immigration law is not a home rule power, as those powers relate only to matters of primarily local concern. The 2013 Illinois court ruling where municipalities’ ordinances trump subsequent state laws, then, would not apply. “Local law enforcement’s authority to enforce immigration law even without the Trust Act is extremely limited,” Patterson continued. “The Trust Act essentially codifies existing Fourth Amendment protections against searches and arrests without warrants or probable cause.”</p>

<p>Patterson’s narrow construction of home rule, though, could mean that Chicago never had the power to pass its sanctuary law in the first place, and that the city’s power to act on any issue that involves state or federal law is limited or nonexistent.</p>

<p>Ann Lousin, an expert in Illinois constitutional law and professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago, said she expects that Chicago’s ordinance will someday be legally challenged on home rule grounds. The outcome “is very hard to predict,” she said, because the issue involves three layers of law: federal immigration law, the state’s non-detainer law, and Chicago’s Welcoming City Ordinance.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be very complicated,” she told The Intercept. “I don’t know how it’s going to turn out.”</p>

<p>A white, artificial pine tree stands in the corner of Catalan-Ramirez’s family’s home two weeks after Christmas. On the wall behind it hang stockings bearing the names of his and Adame’s children – Abraham, Sharol, and Wilmer. On another wall, there’s a heart-shaped picture frame, filled with photos of the couple of 10 years.</p>

<p>But Christmas this year was lonely. “It was a difficult one,” Adame told me, speaking in Spanish. “We spent it here alone, just hoping for his return.”</p>

<p>His absence was particularly difficult for their 4- and 8-year-old children. He is someone “who would give lots of hugs and kisses to his children. He was very expressive of how much he cared for them,” Adame said. Even now, “he makes sure his children are reminded that he loves them.” Wilmer, their youngest child, who witnessed the arrest, remains traumatized by what he saw, asking his mom why police officers are bad people.</p>

<p>On the days her husband was able to call home, he seldom had good news to share. While behind bars, he had experienced seizures and started to suffer from chronic high blood pressure, Adame said. He told her that guards at the detention center sometimes made xenophobic comments, and he feared he’d been singled out because of the lawsuit. His spirits went up and down, but still, those phone calls were a godsend for Adame.</p>

<p>She, too, had seen her life change drastically. When Catalan-Ramirez was violently arrested, her first instinct was to contact the Spanish broadcaster Telemundo.</p>

<p>“It was really shocking to see people come to your home without your permission, to attack us aggressively, physically, to take someone who was just recovering from wounds two months prior – to take him and hurt him that way,” she said. The world had to know what happened.</p>

<p>A journalist at Telemundo introduced her to the network of immigrants’ rights activists in the city – groups like Mijente and Organized Communities Against Deportations – and the lawyers that led Catalan-Ramirez’s two-pronged immigration and civil rights battle.</p>

<p>She had never been involved in community organizing or campaigning, but she became a public face in the battle against deportations and the gang database in Chicago, speaking at news conferences after every court hearing and giving occasional media interviews.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if the public campaign has been favorable to Wilmer,” Adame said, “but we’re definitely doing it so that other people are aware of what’s happening, not only in Chicago, but also in other states.”</p>

<p>The public campaign, Adame learned 10 days later, did indeed pay off.</p>

<p>Catalan-Ramirez came to the United States without authorization in 2005 or 2006, and he was deported back to Guatemala in 2006 following an ICE raid at his workplace, according to his immigration lawyer, Diana Rashid. He re-entered the country — again without authorization — shortly after his deportation, but the details of his immigration status since then are fuzzy, said Rashid, who works at the National Immigrant Justice Center. “From our understanding, he did have another encounter with immigration in 2009,” she said. “It’s very unclear why he was not detained at the time” — because of his prior removal order — “or why they did not reinstate his removal order.”</p>

<p>Catalan-Ramirez’s lawyers challenged his deportation in immigration court by asking for withholding of removal, which protects a person from being deported to a country where he fears persecution. He has also applied for a U-visa, which is given to crime victims who have suffered serious injury and cooperate with law enforcement, as he did after the January 2017 drive-by shooting that left him partially paralyzed. A U-visa creates a pathway to citizenship.</p>

<p>Typically, a denial of a withholding of removal claim means deportation, even if there’s a pending U-visa application; an individual does not have to be physically present in the United States to be granted U status. But while Catalan-Ramirez’s case was pending before the immigration court, a federal appeals court decided that an immigration judge has the authority to grant a temporary waiver to an individual seeking U status. In Catalan-Ramirez’s case, a waiver would mean his deportation would be put on hold at least until the U.S. government makes a decision.</p>

<p>Acting on that ruling, Catalan-Ramirez’s lawyers asked the immigration court for a waiver, and ICE lawyers responded by presenting evidence of his gang membership – based on Chicago Police Department records – that would make him ineligible. In response, Catalan-Ramirez’s lawyers reached a settlement with the city of Chicago. On December 5, they dismissed the lawsuit against the city and the police department, and, in exchange, the police department sent a letter to the immigration judge stating that it has no objection to Catalan-Ramirez being granted a U visa. Despite police records, the letter continues, the department “cannot verify that Mr. Catalan-Ramirez is a gang member” under Illinois law.</p>

<p>The settlement “gave us a lot of knowledge about the gang database that we didn’t have before, and CPD admitting at least in Wilmer’s case that they had no information to verify that he’s a gang member, and yet he’s in that database,” one of his lawyers, del Valle said. “So it’s a pretty big win, not only for Wilmer, but for the gang database campaign.”</p>

<p>Last week, immigration officials agreed to release Catalan-Ramirez under an order of supervision, and in exchange, he dropped the lawsuit against ICE. He was also granted a stay of deportation until his U-visa application is decided. That could take a while, but in the meantime, though he will have to periodically check in with ICE, he can otherwise return to the life he had lived before he was so roughly woken from his sleep 10 months ago.</p>

<p>On Monday, Catalan-Ramirez stepped out of ICE’s downtown Chicago field office, where he was met by a group of supporters chanting, “Wilmer! Wilmer!” For almost a minute, he held his children in a close embrace.</p>

<h2 id="pennsylvaniakeepsalldeathrowinmatesinsolitaryconfinementtheaclucallsthatunconstitutional">Pennsylvania Keeps All Death-Row Inmates in Solitary Confinement. The ACLU Calls That Unconstitutional.</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Maryam Saleh</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-25</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/25/pennsylvania-death-row-solitary-confinement-aclu/ </p>

<p>The 156 death row inmates in Pennsylvania state prisons go to sleep every night the same way they wake up: in an 8-by-12 foot cell illuminated by artificial light around the clock. On weekdays, they are allowed out of their cells for a maximum of two hours to exercise in a small, enclosed space. They leave their cells thrice a week to take showers and are occasionally allowed to go to the law library. Every once in a while, a death-sentenced prisoner gets a visit with clergy or a family member – without being able to touch them. On weekends, they cannot leave their cells at all. For most of their lives, they sit alone in a suffocating cage the size of a parking space.</p>

<p>The American Civil Liberties Union on Thursday filed a lawsuit challenging these conditions, alleging that the Pennsylvania prison system’s mandatory solitary confinement for death-row inmates is unconstitutional, as it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

<p>“The fact that, for these prisoners, solitary confinement is automatic and permanent until either the prisoner is executed, or dies of natural causes, or has his death sentence overturned is very different from the way solitary confinement is used for all other prisoners,” said David Fathi, director of the ACLU’s National Prison Project. “For all other prisoners, you earn your way in and you earn your way out. You serve your punishment, and, if you behave, you can come back to the general population.”</p>

<p>The plaintiffs in the ACLU lawsuit have been held in solitary confinement between 16 and 27 years, under a Pennsylvania Department of Corrections policy that mandates solitary confinement for all prisoners with death sentences. This has been common practice in prisons across the country for a long time, Fathi noted, but “in recent years, an increasing number of states are moving away from that and treating death-sentence prisoners just like anyone else, making an individualized decision on how they’re housed.”</p>

<p>Plaintiffs in the lawsuit have been held in solitary confinement between 16 and 27 years.</p>

<p>Sixty-one percent of 2,802 death-row inmates in state prisons across the country spent more than 20 hours per day in isolation last year, according to a survey of state corrections officials by the Marshall Project. At least one state, Arizona, has since changed its policy, eliminating automatic isolation for its 118 condemned inmates. The Copper State joined California, Colorado, Louisiana, Nevada, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia, all of which changed their policies in recent years to allow death-row inmates more time outside of their cells, according to the Marshall Project.</p>

<p>The ACLU raised the issue of mandatory and indefinite solitary confinement with the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections last year and offered proposals to modify the policy. The department rejected the suggestions in June, according to the lawsuit, and “determined to continue to administer its current capital case housing policy.” The department did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania has executed only three prisoners since the Supreme Court’s 1976 decision in Gregg v. Georgia reinstating the death penalty; it has not executed a prisoner since 1999. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf declared a moratorium on the death penalty in 2015, yet the Department of Corrections continues to sign execution warrants.</p>

<p>Eighty percent of the state’s current death-row inmates have been held in continuous solitary confinement for more than 10 years, which is higher than averages in other states, said Fathi. The internationally recognized Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 2015, prohibit solitary confinement for a period longer than 15 consecutive days.</p>

<p>The disastrous psychological and physiological effects of prolonged isolation are well-documented. It can lead to hypersensitivity to stimuli, delusions, hallucinations, and panic attacks. Prisoners’ lack of interaction with other people can lead to paranoia, anxiety, nervousness, and depression.</p>

<p>“Plaintiff Mark Newton Spotz, who has been held in continuous solitary confinement in SCI Greene for 21 years, describes his experience as ‘psychological torture,’ where prisoners are ‘treated like animals’ and forced to ‘depend on everybody for everything,’” according to the lawsuit. “He feels ‘trapped in [his] cell’ – and his ‘mind is like a popcorn machine.’”</p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court commented on how solitary confinement can be detrimental to mental health in 1890, noting that some prisoners subject to confinement “became violently insane; others still, committed suicide; while those who stood the ordeal better were not generally reformed, and in most cases did not recover sufficient mental activity to be of any subsequent service to the community.” Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy referred to that opinion in a 2015 ruling, writing, “Research still confirms what this Court suggested over a century ago: Years on end of near-total-isolation exact a terrible price.”</p>

<p>Solitary confinement is generally used as a punitive measure against prison rule-breakers and based on an individualized assessment. In the lawsuit, filed in a U.S. district court in Pennsylvania, the ACLU says the same standard should be applied to death row. The plaintiffs asked the court to find that Pennsylvania’s practice is unconstitutional, stop state prisons from subjecting prisoners to indefinite solitary confinement without opportunity for review, and create a plan within 30 days that provides for an individualized placement procedure for death-sentenced inmates.</p>

<p>Anthony Graves was exonerated in 2010 after spending 12 years in mandatory solitary confinement as a death-row prisoner in Texas and now works with the ACLU of Texas. He described his prolonged isolation in an interview with The Intercept: “If you imagine what hell could be, that’s what solitary confinement is,” he said. “Every day. Every hour of the day. Day in and day out. It’s a system designed to break your will to live.”</p>

<p>He suffered from post-traumatic stress and feelings of abandonment and loneliness after his release, he said, but was able to eventually adjust due to a strong support system he had. Most prisoners who spend years in isolation, however, struggle to reintegrate into society.</p>

<p>“I’m the exception, not the rule,” Graves said. “People like me are not supposed to cope.”</p>

<p>How could the same Senate Democrats — and Jeff Flake — who characterize the Trump administration as one that continuously erodes democratic norms and might even be “Stalinist,” go ahead and vote to expand the same administration’s spying powers for six years?</p>

<p>We asked them about how they arrived at that curious position. None voiced any concern over giving Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the FBI access to NSA data, which can be searched without a warrant.</p>

<p>The bill, which passed 65-34, extends the NSA’s surveillance powers until 2023 and consolidates the FBI’s authority to search those communications without a warrant. The decade-old law is designed to surveil foreign “targets,” but law-abiding Americans are swept into it as well.</p>

<p>Twenty-one Democrats and one independent joined Republicans in reauthorizing Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the National Security Agency to collect mass amounts of Americans’ communications without a warrant.</p>

<p>“It explicitly authorizes warrantless searches of law-abiding Americans, and allows for the collection of communications entirely among innocent Americans who reference the wrong foreigner, and gives the attorney general unchecked power to decide when the government can use what it finds against us, to pick just three of its many troubling provisions,” Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said in a statement following the vote.</p>

<p>The Thursday vote came two days after Senate Democrats — in a narrow vote in which Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., was the deciding factor — helped pass a motion to successfully block any possible amendments to the FISA bill.</p>

<p>Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., introduced an amendment on Tuesday to ban backdoor searches. Hours later, she voted to shut down the amendment process. When we asked her why she ultimately voted for the motion, Feinstein said, “Because I think, you know, we went over it in Intelligence. I sort of know where things are. And I think we should just get it done, is my view.” Feinstein, whom Trump has referred to as “Sneaky Dianne Feinstein,” recently released a transcript of congressional testimony from the co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm that famously authored the dossier on Trump’s ties to Russian officials.</p>

<p>Angus King, an independent senator from Maine, said he voted to block the amendment process because “I worked on amendments on the committee bill that I think were adequate.” Asked whether he trusts Sessions to allow backdoor searches without warrants, he declined to comment. King is a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>

<p>Democrats backed mass surveillance under the Obama administration as well, but critics point to the hypocrisy of fixating on Trump’s authoritarian tendencies while expanding his domestic surveillance abilities. The Senate vote came a week after 55 House Democrats helped pass the 702 reauthorization, which happened during a news cycle dominated by reports about Trump’s mental state.</p>

<p>Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., when asked if he trusts the Trump administration with warrantless surveillance powers said, “I’m 1,000 percent for it, for the security of our nation.” His vote was not necessarily a surprise, though. Manchin has voted in line with Trump’s position in a majority of cases.</p>

<p>Alabama Sen. Doug Jones doesn’t have any concerns either. “I’m comfortable with the bill,” he said.</p>

<p>Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said he’s “fairly comfortable with 702.” As for whether Sessions could abuse his power under the law, Whitehouse said, “I think it’s quite well constrained. I think heads would roll and jobs would be lost if people cheated on the rules.”</p>

<p>But it wasn’t only the Democrats whose double standards were on display. Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., is one of Trump’s most outspoken Republican critics. On the same day he gave a speech drawing parallels between the Trump administration and Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin, he laughed when we asked him why he would give the same administration broad spying powers. He declined to answer.</p>

<p>Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Steve Daines of Montana, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Dean Heller of Nevada, Mike Lee of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul of Kentucky, all voted against the motion to kill the debate. Cruz, however, ended up voting for the final bill.</p>

<p>“I think we have to stay very, very focused about the implementation of the legislation and do that through the Judiciary Committee, as well as the Intelligence Committee,” Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said.</p>

<p>On Friday, Trump signed the FISA bill into law. “This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election,” he tweeted. “I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!”</p>

<p>Apparently, when it comes to mass surveillance, even his staunchest opponents think so, too.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/19/ice-new-sanctuary-movement-ravi-ragbir-deportation/ </p>

<p>When word came down from the upper floors of Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan that Immigration and Customs Enforcement was taking custody of Ravidath Ragbir and intended to deport him, hundreds of his supporters, standing outside on the cold sidewalk, raised up their hands to the monolithic building and screamed.</p>

<p>Ragbir had entered the building willingly, on his own steam, accompanied by his wife and family, his legal team, and a handful of elected officials. Now, his friends outside learned, Ravi — as everyone knows him — wouldn’t be coming back to them. They had planned for this possibility even as they hoped it wouldn’t come, but the plans soon gave way to a spontaneous gesture of resistance. As the ambulance carrying a handcuffed Ragbir — he had briefly fainted when he was taken into custody — pulled out of the Federal Plaza garage, supporters attempted to stop its progress. Friends, colleagues, clergy, and city council members put their bodies in front of the vehicle, blocking it with their lives.</p>

<p>The resulting chaos was exacerbated by law enforcement officers who pushed, yanked, and choked the nonviolent protesters. By the time the melee had died down outside the gates of New York City Hall, 18 people had been arrested and the ambulance had gotten away.</p>

<p>The EMT vehicle dropped Ragbir’s wife off at the front door of the hospital, but then sped off, transporting him to a different hospital. Ragbir was briefly examined before being taken in quick succession to immigration detention centers in Manhattan and New Jersey. By that evening, he was at the Krome Detention Center in Florida, awaiting final deportation to the country of his birth, Trinidad.</p>

<p>Ragbir moved to the United States more than 20 years ago and became a legal permanent resident. In 2001, he was convicted of wire fraud conspiracy for his role in a mortgage business that came under criminal investigation. After 2 1/2 years in prison, he was ordered to be deported. Throughout years of ongoing appeals, he was incarcerated first in New Jersey and then in Alabama. When he finally won his release pending the appeal’s outcome, Ragbir devoted his energies to helping people like himself: immigrants in danger of deportation.</p>

<p>The New Sanctuary Coalition of New York City, where Ragbir is the executive director, emphasizes the power of illuminating the dark and confusing workings of the federal immigration machine. The coalition runs workshops to help immigrants fleeing violence in their home countries to apply for asylum. It sends groups of friendly volunteers to accompany people called to hearings in immigration court or mandatory check-ins with ICE officials. It builds a community of trust and mutual aid among New York’s most vulnerable and isolated immigrants.</p>

<p>The New Sanctuary Coalition’s work builds on a movement begun by religious congregations in the 1980s to support Central American refugees in defiance of Reagan-era immigration policies. Grounded in religious congregations, the movement relies in part on the government’s reluctance to send law enforcement into houses of worship. The concept of sanctuary — that people inside houses of worship enjoy some special protection from agents of the state — goes back centuries. But it doesn’t rest on any firm legal footing. While certain actions, like disrupting religious ceremonies, are illegal, the force keeping ICE officers from raiding churches has more to do with optics, said Rev. Michael Ellick, a former pastor at Judson Memorial Church and a friend of Ragbir. “It’s like, ‘OK, you can come and do that, but we’re going to have cameras rolling and everyone’s going to see you storming a church,’” he said. “Previous administrations, we thought they wouldn’t do that. But this administration? Who knows?”</p>

<p>Ragbir’s detention was the second such arrest of a New Sanctuary Coalition leader by ICE in the space of a week. It was only the most recent and public in a series of developments that advocates believe is part of a concerted effort to intimidate and dismantle the immigration rights movement in New York City. Coalition members say unmarked cars with heavily tinted windows have begun surveilling churches and movement leaders’ homes. Clergy who work with New York’s immigrant communities say that ICE agents have repeatedly entered church property and interrogated people as they come and go from houses of worship.</p>

<p>The events in New York are taking place against a national backdrop of escalating actions against prominent immigrant rights figures. On December 20, ICE agents in Washington state began deportation proceedings against Maru Mora-Villalpando, founder of an organization that leads weekly rallies and vigils outside the gates of Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, Washington. In Colorado, ICE detained the husband of Ingrid Encalada Latorre, an undocumented Peruvian mother who has been taking sanctuary in Denver-area churches since 2016.</p>

<p>“It seems like they’re trying to create an atmosphere of uncertainty where nobody feels safe,” said Nathan Yaffe, a lawyer who works with the New Sanctuary Coalition to help people file asylum applications. “At the same time, they’re trying to exile our moral leaders in order to break the movement.”</p>

<p>“ICE thinks that by removing the leaders,” Yaffe added, “they can destroy the movement.”</p>

Montrevil was deported on Jan. 16, 2018, as part of what some New Sanctuary Coalition members think is an attack on their organization.</p>

<p>On the morning of January 3, a week before Ragbir was scheduled to check in at ICE’s Field Office in Lower Manhattan, his colleague Jean Montrevil had just left work and was on his way home to Queens. Arriving outside his house, he was stopped by ICE officials, according to his lawyer, Joshua Bardavid. The stop came as a surprise – Montrevil wasn’t scheduled for his next ICE check-in until March, and he had never missed a scheduled appointment with immigration officials. A business owner and father of four, he was hardly a flight risk.</p>

<p>“We war-gamed this over and over. This was the best time and place to take him.”</p>

<p>Montrevil emigrated from Haiti with a green card in 1986, but was convicted a few years later, while still a teenager, on drug charges. He served a five-year prison sentence. In the nearly 30 years since his juvenile conviction, Montrevil has by all accounts been a model citizen. “He got married, had four children, started a company, and showed that what he did when he was 17 was not who he was,” Bardavid said. “He made a serious mistake, and he made all the amends he could and then some.”</p>

<p>A judge, however, had found that Montrevil was deportable shortly after his conviction — a determination made without allowing the young Haitian a lawyer or witnesses, Bardavid said. Montrevil has been fighting to correct that error ever since. Montrevil continued to check in periodically with ICE as he waited for a ruling in his appeal. After the last check-in over the summer, his first under the Trump administration, he believed that he had reached an understanding with ICE officials, Bardavid said: As long as the appeal was pending, ICE would hold off on deportation proceedings.</p>

<p>That understanding was shattered on January 3, when ICE agents arrested Montrevil outside his home. Bardavid, along with family and friends in the New Sanctuary movement, scrambled to find him and win his release. By the time Montrevil was located in New Jersey, he was only a few hours away from being transported to ICE’s Krome Detention Center in Florida.</p>

<p>Days later, Bardavid asked Scott Mechkowski, ICE’s deputy Field Office director for New York, why the agency had sent a team to apprehend Montrevil at home months before his scheduled check-in. “We war-gamed this over and over,” Mechkowski said, according to Bardavid. “This was the best time and place to take him.”</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, Montrevil disappeared from ICE’s online detainee locator database. Shortly afterward, Bardavid learned that he had been deported to Haiti.</p>

<p>The inexplicable surprise detention of one of their leaders set members of the New Sanctuary Coalition on edge. The same night Montrevil was taken into custody, members of Ragbir’s defense committee met at the New Sanctuary Coalition offices at Judson Memorial Chapel in Manhattan to prepare for his ICE check-in the following week.</p>

<p>A little after 9 p.m., Will Coley, a member of Ragbir’s defense committee, was leaving the office when a man in an SUV called out to him through the vehicle’s dark tinted windows.</p>

<p>“He starts asking me where the entrance to the church is,” Coley said. “I said, ‘Well, there are a couple different entrances, what are you looking for?’ He says, ‘Well, my friend is here for a meeting.’ I said, ‘What meeting?’ He said, ‘I don’t know.’ I said, ‘What’s his name?’ And he said, ‘Tom … Boland?’ It was almost like he made it up on the spot.”</p>

<p>Coley went back into the church offices, but there was no “Tom Boland” to be found. When he went back outside, the man and his SUV had disappeared.</p>

<p>“That’s when I started paying attention to the other cars on the street,” Coley said. Surveying the street, Coley and other New Sanctuary members identified at least three vehicles on the church’s block, all with New York license plates, all parked illegally, all idling, all with distinctive antennas, and all with dark tinted windows.</p>

<p>Coley and a partner decided to speak to the people in the cars. One woman, in a sedan, denied that she was affiliated with immigration enforcement, but declined to say why she was idling on the block.</p>

<p>Looping around the block, Coley and his partner approached a man idling in a minivan. When the man rolled down the window to speak with them, Coley looked into the front seat. “I look down on the passenger floorboard, and I see a white license plate that says DHS,” Coley said. ICE operates as part of the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>Ragbir’s legal team began to wonder whether it was safe for him to go back to his home in downtown Brooklyn that night, or if ICE was preparing to grab him the way it had Montrevil. Coley and two other friends of Ragbir’s decided to take a ride-share to Ragbir’s home to see if it too was under surveillance. Along the way, they picked up Yaffe, the asylum lawyer. The group saw idling vehicles outside Ragbir’s apartment and decided to send Coley up to see if it provoked any reaction. “As soon as he approached the front door, two people in the two front vehicles, who had been looking down, not seeming to pay attention, started craning their necks,” Yaffe said. “When he went in, they started talking on radios. We could hear the distorted noise of radio voices from across the street.”</p>

<p>When he came back down from the apartment a few minutes later, Coley knocked on the windows of the two vehicles, trying to talk with their drivers. Neither would roll down their windows.</p>

<p>Rattled by the day’s events, their minds racing, Ragbir’s friends tried to puzzle out what was going on. Was ICE trying to avoid a media spectacle by taking him in early and clandestinely? When he was called to the ICE Field Office in March, hundreds of supporters had filled Foley Square, outside 26 Federal Plaza; so many reporters had tried to follow him to the check-in that Ragbir wasn’t able to enter the building for 15 minutes. City council members who had accompanied Ragbir were appalled by what they saw in the ICE waiting room and spoke passionately to the press afterward about the inhumanity of ICE’s deportation regime. (ICE declined to answer questions about its alleged surveillance of Judson and Ragbir’s home.)</p>

<p>After the night of the mysterious cars outside his apartment, Ragbir’s friends made sure that wherever he went, he was accompanied by someone at all times.</p>

<p>Two days after Ragbir’s allies saw suspicious cars outside his home, four clergy members affiliated with the New Sanctuary Coalition arrived at ICE’s offices in Manhattan and asked for a meeting. They were invited into an office with Mechkowski, the office’s deputy director.</p>

<p>“It was not many questions from us. It was a lot of him talking to and at us,” said Rev. Micah Bucey, a pastor at Judson Memorial Church. Rev. Juan Carlos Ruiz, a Lutheran minister and organizer with the New Sanctuary Coalition, added, “It felt like confession.”</p>

<p>The reverends had gone in intending only to talk about Montrevil, and not the delicate question of Ragbir’s impending check-in, but to their surprise, Mechkowski made the connection himself. “He linked the two,” Bucey said. “He talked about them being the two highest-profile cases in New York City.”</p>

<p>Bucey paraphrased the gist of Mechkowski’s message that day: “My hands are tied by higher-ups. We have to do what we have to do. These are high-profile cases, but you have to understand that deferred status is not a status. If we defer these cases further, it will just go to someone else, and I won’t allow that.” (ICE declined to make Mechkowski available for an interview or to answer questions about his meeting with the pastors.)</p>

<p>Asked by the clergy whether ICE was surveilling Judson Memorial Church, Mechkowski flatly denied it, Ruiz said. “I further asked, ‘You didn’t send anyone to Ravi’s house?’ He said, ‘No, because I know where Ravi lives, and I have seen him walking around, and I could have taken him myself.’ And he mentioned the street. He had it in his mind.”</p>

<p>Bucey and Ruiz said Mechkowski told them that Montrevil’s detention had been done to avoid the sort of noisy protest that had accompanied Ragbir’s previous check-in nine months earlier. “He said they didn’t want the display of wailing kids and wailing clergy,” Bucey said. Mechkowski issued a warning, the reverend said, about Ragbir’s next check-in. According to Bucey, Mechkowski said, “That can’t happen this time around.”</p>

<p>The cars outside Judson aren’t the only alleged instances of houses of worship affiliated with the New Sanctuary movement coming under surveillance. Amandus Derr, senior pastor of St. Peter’s, a Lutheran church on Lexington and 54th Street in Manhattan, said he personally encountered a pair of ICE agents on their way into the church on December 11 as some 300 people were attending Mass.</p>

<p>Derr, who was not leading the proceedings, was walking out of the church on his way home when he encountered two men in overcoats, jackets, and ties, wearing no visible identification. “I asked them if I could help them,” Derr recalled. “They said, ‘We hear there’s a large Hispanic celebration going on.’ They were not Hispanic. I said, ‘Well, there’s a Mass going on right now in our sanctuary. Our bishop is here. Do you want to go to the Mass?’ Their response was, ‘No, we just want to look around and maybe talk to some people. We’re from Immigration and Custom Enforcement.’ I said, ‘Are you looking for someone specific?’ They said no. I said, ‘Do you have a warrant?’ They said no.”</p>

<p>Derr says he took the agents by the elbows and escorted them out of the church and down the block.</p>

<p>“It’s the first time something this clear has happened at our church,” Derr said.</p>

<p>“There are two principles here,” Derr said. “One is, a house of worship in the United States, maybe not legally, but historically, since forever, is a sanctuary.” Even more disturbing to Derr was the timing, he said: “There was a Mass going on. Interrupting a religious service is illegal.”</p>

<p>The encroachment of ICE agents onto St. Peter’s property isn’t unique. At St. Jacobi, a Lutheran Church in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, the congregation is largely Spanish- and Chinese-speaking and includes many undocumented people. The church often hosts immigration workshops for the community, which are well-attended. But Pastor Gary Mills said he was surprised, at one workshop in the middle of last September, to see a white woman in attendance. “You never see white people in that church or in that neighborhood,” Mills says. “I asked her what she was doing and she said she was with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. I asked her if she could please leave the church, which she did.”</p>

<p>Mills says he complained about the incident to the ICE Field Office in Manhattan, where he was told “they would address it.” But a couple of weeks later, Mills was presiding over a Spanish-language Sunday Mass at his other church, Advent Lutheran, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, when ICE made another appearance.</p>

<p>“There was someone who was stopping people on their way out and asking them where they were from,” Mills said. A congregant alerted Mills, who confronted the visitor. “They said they were from ICE. I told them they couldn’t be on the church steps, on church property, and that person left.”</p>

<p>Neither congregation is associated with the New Sanctuary movement, Mills said, but they do provide well-publicized services for undocumented immigrants. The episodes have contributed to an atmosphere of anxiety in the immigrant community. “There’s fear within the community,” Mills said. “Do we dare come into this church or into another house of worship?”</p>

<p>An ICE spokesperson declined to answer The Intercept’s questions about its agents’ alleged presence on church property, instead referring to ICE’s internal policy categorizing places of worship, along with schools, health care facilities, and rallies, as “sensitive locations.” According to that policy, “Enforcement actions may occur at sensitive locations in limited circumstances, but will generally be avoided. ICE officers and agents may conduct an enforcement action at a sensitive location if there are exigent circumstances, if other law enforcement actions have led officers to a sensitive location, or with prior approval from an appropriate supervisory official.”</p>

<p>The apparent attack on the New Sanctuary movement, specifically, and advocates of immigrant rights, more broadly, brings longstanding debates over New York City’s cooperation with ICE into sharp relief. Mayor Bill de Blasio has repeatedly proclaimed New York a “sanctuary city,” and city government has taken some steps to protect its residents from ICE. With some significant exceptions, for example, city police and corrections officers don’t comply with ICE requests to prolong the detention of people in their custody so ICE can take them into custody.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group, a heavily armed, quick-response unit founded in 2015, worked together with federal officers to clear the way for the vehicle carrying Ragbir out of the Lower Manhattan’s Federal Plaza last week, as protesters tried to block the ambulance’s progress. The NYPD arrested 18 people that morning, including clergy and city council members. The NYPD also provided an escort for the ICE agents transporting Ragbir, first to a hospital, then to an ICE detention center in Manhattan, and finally to the city boundary at the entrance of the Holland Tunnel, as Ragbir was shuttled to Newark Airport, where he would be put on a plane to Florida.</p>

<p>“When the police are clearing the street to make sure they have a smooth way to the detention center, that is cooperation.”</p>

<p>A police spokesperson told The Intercept that the NYPD does not routinely provide escorts for ICE detainee transport. “Last week’s interaction with DHS/ICE was based solely on the overall public safety issues which existed at the time,” the spokesperson said. “The reason for SRG accompanying DHS/ICE to the Holland Tunnel was due to the fact that earlier that day there was an incident that created a potentially dangerous traffic situation with protesters and street crowds, and we wanted to insure that we had resources immediately available to deal with such an incident within the city limits.”</p>

<p>That explanation wasn’t reassuring to some members of the New Sanctuary Coalition, who wondered how police cooperation with the attempted deportation of a nonviolent immigration rights leader could be squared with de Blasio’s repeated commitment to make New York itself a “sanctuary.” “When the police are clearing the street to make sure they have a smooth way to the detention center, that is cooperation,” said Ruiz, one of the clergymen arrested that day.</p>

<p>Leaving the New Sanctuary offices at Judson Memorial Chapel the night of Ragbir’s detention, a longtime volunteer for the movement said she had another troubling interaction with the police. Speaking through a translator and requesting not to be identified by her real name because of her immigration status, Silvia, a Mexican woman in her 40s who lives in Harlem, said she had left the church around 9:30 p.m. The blocks between the church entrance were lined with parked police vehicles, she said. “I was walking with my daughter, nieces, brother, and sister-in-law,” she said. “A white policeman stopped me. I saw his silver badge. He said, ‘Señora!’ And then, in English, he asked me why we were coming out of that building, what we were doing in there.” Pretending to misunderstand, Silvia gestured at a nearby New York University building. “‘NYU? I’m not coming out of NYU,’ I said. ‘Why? Why are you asking?’ But the officer wouldn’t answer, and he told me to move along.”</p>

<p>A police spokesperson told The Intercept that, while there was an increased police presence in the neighborhood that night, it was related to a different event down the block from Judson church and unrelated to the New Sanctuary movement.</p>

<p>A week after he was first detained, Ravi Ragbir remained in ICE custody in Florida. His lawyers petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court contesting the legality of his detention, and a federal judge has issued a temporary stay of deportation, directing ICE not to move Ragbir away from New York. ICE initially balked at returning Ragbir, but after a January 16 hearing, at the judge’s urging, ICE officials agreed to return Ragbir to detention in the New York area while his legal challenge is resolved.</p>

<p>ICE declined to answer a long list of specific questions from The Intercept for this article, and instead offered a general statement. “Mr. Ragbir is the subject of a final removal order,” the statement said. The statement said that, at the time, Ragbir was being “transported back to New York pending resolution of his court proceedings.” (He arrived at an Orange County, New York, detention facility on Thursday.) In addition to acknowledging the ongoing court proceedings, however, ICE also said Ragbir had “exhausted his petitions and appeals” — a statement representatives for Ragbir said was false, pointing to an open court case and a motion to reopen immigration proceedings.</p>

<p>The New Sanctuary Coalition’s core work, connecting immigrants with legal counsel, assisting with asylum applications, and accompanying people to their immigration court dates and ICE check-ins, continues, at least for the moment, unimpeded.</p>

<p>People close to New Sanctuary, however, say they are concerned that something fundamental has changed in recent weeks and that federal immigration enforcement is targeting their movement.</p>

<p>Joshua Bardavid, the lawyer of the now-deported New Sanctuary leader Jean Montrevil, said that the events of the last two weeks leave him with no doubt that ICE is targeting leaders of the immigrant rights movement. “This was not just ICE going about its daily business, this was a plan,” Bardavid said. “There is absolutely no way that Jean and Ravi were targeted with detention the same day and other places that support them were surveilled and had to deal with federal agents all on the same day. There are few things I’m so certain of.”</p>

<p>Montrevil’s deportation signals a disturbing legal shift, Bardavid said: The Haitian activist’s challenge to his underlying order of removal was still pending when he was deported. “It’s absolutely new for ICE to be deporting people who still have open appeals,” he said.</p>

<p>Bardavid believes the actions against the New Sanctuary Coalition leaders must have required approval beyond ICE’s New York Field Office, at the national level. “This means there’s a group of government officials who got together and made this decision,” he said. “That’s terrifying. It means there are people who want to undercut the immigrant rights movement. It means that the government no longer sees that it has an obligation or a reason to talk with immigrant rights organizations and has no problem destroying what dialogue and relationship existed.”</p>

<p>Bucey, the Judson pastor, said that while he believes ICE has targeted Ragbir and Montrevil for deportation in an effort to weaken the movement, he doesn’t think it will work, because the movement they built empowers immigrants to be their own leaders. “All these tendrils have grown out of the wounds of these chopped-off limbs,” Bucey said. “It’s an entire community now, not just a little institution led by a few people.”</p>

<p>Sylvia, the New Sanctuary member who described her encounter with a police officer, admits that the events of the last weeks have left her so terrified that she frequently finds her legs shaking uncontrollably. “They’re trying to intimidate people and make people afraid so that they win the battle,” Sylvia said in an interview at the New Sanctuary offices. “But I’m not going to let them win. When you fall in a river, your instinct is to float, and for me to float is to keep coming here, to keep fighting. I feel I can be useful to other families, and that makes me feel good.”</p>

<h2 id="ninehumanitarianactivistsfacefederalchargesafterleavingwaterformigrantsinthearizonadesert">Nine Humanitarian Activists Face Federal Charges After Leaving Water for Migrants in the Arizona Desert</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Ryan Devereaux</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/no-more-deaths-arizona-border-littering-charges-immigration/ </p>

<p>A faith-based humanitarian group that provides aid and shelter to undocumented migrants on the southwestern border fears it has become the latest target in the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration advocates. Nine members of the group, No More Deaths, were charged with federal crimes and misdemeanors in recent months, including one volunteer arrested last week shortly after the publication of a report documenting alleged abuses by the U.S. Border Patrol.</p>

<p>Last week, the Tucson, Arizona-based organization published a report presenting what it described as evidence of Border Patrol agents’ systematic destruction of water jugs left for migrants in the desert, as well as “months of increasing surveillance and harassment” by the agency beginning last year. Hours after the report was published, one of the group’s organizers was arrested in a remote area of Arizona, along with two undocumented immigrants, and hit with felony charges.</p>

<p>According to a complaint filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Arizona, Border Patrol agents conducting surveillance in the town of Ajo observed Scott Warren, 35, and two undocumented immigrants entering a building — referred to as “the Barn” — on January 17, 2018, the same day the humanitarian group’s report was published. The migrants reportedly learned of the Barn’s address, and the sanctuary it was said to provide, through online research.</p>

<p>“Warren met them outside and gave them food and water for approximately three days,” the complaint states, accusing the activist and Arizona State University instructor of also providing the migrants with “beds and clean clothes.”</p>

<p>With assistance from Pima County sheriffs’ deputies, the Border Patrol agents knocked on the door of the Barn and found Warren and the others inside. The government is now relying on the migrants as material witnesses in its case against Warren, who was charged with bringing in and harboring undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>For Warren, last week marked his second brush with federal law enforcement since June, when he was cited by an officer with the Department of the Interior in the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge for unauthorized use of a motor vehicle in a federally designated wildlife area and abandoning personal property — littering — in a national wildlife refuge.</p>

<p>The same types of charges — misdemeanors that carry a maximum six-month sentence — have also been used against eight other No More Deaths summer volunteers, most of them from out of state. U.S. marshals began serving the summonses last month, when many of the volunteers had returned home to locations across the country. On Tuesday, the defendants, whose charges have not been previously reported, had their first court hearing — the five out-of-state defendants attended by video.</p>

<p>Legally, Warren’s arrest last week and the summonses he and his fellow volunteers received are distinct cases, but that doesn’t mean they are unrelated, No More Deaths says. At the center of it all, the group says, is its longstanding practice of leaving jugs of water for migrants making their way through some of the border’s most treacherous terrain, and a broader campaign on the part of the Trump administration to target immigration advocates with prosecutions related to their work.</p>

<p>“They’re definitely connected,” said William G. Walker, a Tucson-based attorney who has represented No More Deaths volunteers for more than a decade and is currently providing counsel to the latest round of defendants. No More Deaths has maintained “a cooperative, working relationship with both the Border Patrol and the U.S. attorney’s office,” Walker said in an interview before Tuesday’s court hearing. The activities the volunteers are accused of taking part in, the attorney explained, are activities the organization has “been engaged in for the last several years.”</p>

<p>“Border Patrol — and the U.S. attorney — knows about the activities, has surveilled the activities, has permitted the activities, has recognized that we’re out there helping to save lives,” Walker said. “And now all of the sudden it’s all changed.”</p>

<p>Border Patrol declined to comment on the recent charges, deferring to the U.S. attorney’s office. In a statement to the Washington Post Tuesday night, Carlos Diaz, a spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said that Warren’s arrest was “not retaliation” and “we’re protecting immigration laws in the area and there was a situation in which we needed to do the arrest because there were some illegal individuals in that area.”</p>

<p>The U.S. attorney’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the other No More Deaths cases. In an interview with The Intercept last week, however, Steven Passement, acting special operations supervisor in the Border Patrol’s Tucson sector, said his agents “work together” with No More Deaths in situations “where it involves saving lives.”</p>

<p>While the federal government maintained a hands-off approach in recent years, the arrest of a volunteer for providing assistance to undocumented migrants and the attempt to prosecute members who leave water for migrants in federal wildlife preserves are issues the organization has dealt with before.</p>

<p>In 2005, volunteers Shanti Sellz and Daniel Strauss were arrested by Border Patrol agents as they attempted to transport three undocumented migrants to a local hospital. The volunteers, both in their early 20s at the time, faced up to 15 years in prison. But a judge threw out the charges, ruling that the young volunteers were acting in accordance with a set of protocols they had been told were legally sound. Five years later, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a littering conviction against Daniel Millis, a No More Deaths volunteer, for leaving gallons of water for migrants in Arizona’s Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, ruling that water did not meet the definition of waste.</p>

<p>Walker represented the defendants in both cases. In the wake of the Millis ruling in 2010, he said his client’s prosecution was the result of “a highly politicized decision by the Department of Justice under the Bush administration to shut these people down.” Eight years later, Walker suggested the era of politicized prosecutions has returned with a vengeance under the Trump administration, attributing the shift to “the federal government being of such a mindset that they’re more interested in locking up humanitarians than they are in really going after real crime.”</p>

<p>Walker said there are persistent complaints among Arizonans that not enough focus is given to enforcing the law and strained resources mean crime fighting falls by the wayside. “So why are we out there, then, using these precious resources to slash water bottles?” he asked. “To arrest and charge humanitarian volunteers from across the country that are trying to save lives?”</p>

<p>“I know why we do it,” he added. “We have a racist federal government now, and you can quote me on that.”</p>

<p>From the beginning of his campaign through his first year in office, President Donald Trump and top officials in the administration have pursued a multipronged approach to immigration enforcement. Not only are undocumented immigrants targeted — whether they are in the process of traveling north past the border or already in the country — but anyone who aides in their continued existence within U.S. borders can face the force of the law.</p>

<p>Among the Trump officials taking a hard line are former Department of Homeland Security secretary-turned-White House chief of staff John Kelly, who appeared on national television to defend separating mothers from their children at the U.S. border; Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who called on federal prosecutors nationwide to bring charges against parents who pay to have their children smuggled into the U.S.; and Thomas Homan, the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, who last year said all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. should live in fear and called for the prosecution of political officials who resist the administration’s enforcement agenda.</p>

<p>Recent weeks have seen a string of reports from across the country of outspoken, undocumented immigration advocates arrested and, in some cases, deported. Earlier this month in New York City, two prominent immigration activists were arrested — and one deported — prompting a chaotic protest in lower Manhattan. An investigation by The Intercept found that the arrests were preceded by a series of visits by ICE officers — and potential surveillance — to houses of worship around the city that provide sanctuary to undocumented immigrants.</p>

<p>ICE has denied that its arrests are politically motivated. And it may well be the case that there is no overriding order to immigration agents — whether they work for ICE, Border Patrol, or CBP — to take actions that they would have been inclined not to take in years past. But immigration advocates from coast to coast worry that the change in posture and rhetoric coming from the White House alone has been enough to change conditions on the ground.</p>

<p>“I think one of the things that we’re seeing is an escalation in tactics by on-the-ground agents that are emboldened by racist and dehumanizing policies of this administration,” said Genevieve Schroeder, a volunteer with No More Deaths. “It has really disturbing implications for emboldened actions that are being taken against people that are in the field, who have much less of a media platform than humanitarian aid workers or possibly sanctuary rights movement leaders.”</p>

<p>Born out of a multi-faith border conference in 2004, No More Deaths serves as an umbrella organization for an array of religious and community groups working in some of the harshest terrain along the divide between the U.S. and Mexico. In addition to leaving gallon jugs of water in remote areas where migrants make their way into the U.S., the organization also maintains camps where migrants can receive medical care and routinely aids in the recovery of bodies along the border.</p>

<p>The true scale of deaths that occur along the U.S. border with Mexico is unknown, but academic and journalistic investigations in recent years point to a loss of life of epic proportions. In a report published in December, USA Today found that illegal border crossings have claimed at least “7,209 lives over the past 20 years,” but that “the actual number is far higher” because “federal authorities largely fail to count border crossers when their remains are recovered by local authorities, and even local counts are often incomplete.”</p>

<p>In Arizona, specifically, No More Deaths says the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge has become a particularly deadly location, accounting for 45 percent of the remains found in the state in 2017. Volunteers described the refuge, with its limited vehicle accessibility, as a mass graveyard where humanitarian visits routinely result in the discovery of human remains.</p>

<p>In a report published last year, DHS said the “southwest land border is more difficult to illegally cross today than ever before.” This increased difficulty has had numerous second- and third-order effects. One is the rise of a booming smuggling market, which is in many respects managed by Mexico’s vicious organized crime syndicates. According to last year’s DHS report, “Relatively few illegal border crossers hired a smuggler prior to 2001, but usage rates climbed to 80-95 percent among apprehended border crossers in 2015.” The post-9/11 build-up of an unparalleled border surveillance infrastructure and the deployment of thousands of new Border Patrol agents in recent years has caused these smuggling networks to adapt, in part, by funneling migrants through more remote and dangerous terrain.</p>

<p>The re-routing of immigrant pathways is not an accident. The effort to push migrants away from more populated areas came about through a 20-year-old Border Patrol strategy known as “prevention through deterrence.” No More Deaths views the strategy as a driving force behind the dramatic rise in border deaths over the past two decades. The organization is not shy about the radical political solutions it sees to the problems on the border. In a set of demands included in its report last week, the humanitarian group, along with its partner organization, La Coalición de Derechos Humanos, called for the “permanent” dismantling of the U.S. Border Patrol and a “reparations program for the families of all persons disappeared or deceased as a result of the U.S. border policy of Prevention Through Deterrence.”</p>

<p>The politics of No More Deaths have clearly placed the group at odds with the Border Patrol, not to mention the armed right-wing militias that roam the Arizona desert. But as Walker, the attorney, noted, recent years have been characterized by an understanding between the volunteers and the law enforcement agency. The first strong indication of a change in that understanding occurred in June, when Border Patrol agents tracked a group of migrants to a No More Deaths encampment outside of Arivaca, Arizona. Following a tense, three-day stand-off, roughly 30 well-armed Border Patrol agents entered the camp and removed the migrants, who had been receiving medical care.</p>

<p>Walker said the U.S. attorney’s office in Arizona is venturing into dangerous territory if it intends to ramp up prosecutions of No More Deaths volunteers. Not only have similar efforts failed in the past, he said, but the kind of humanitarian work the group does is popular among many Arizonans, particularly in Tucson. “We have a humanitarian-oriented community here. We’re migrant-friendly and we understand the value of migrants here and what they do for our society,” he said. “This is not two different sides that have two different stories and different legitimate positions. We have conservative Republican people that are out there putting water out for migrants. Humanitarians are on all sides of the political spectrum.”</p>

<p>Schroeder, the No More Deaths volunteer, worries that without a swift change in direction, the continued targeting of immigrant rights advocates could become “normalized in the same way that the deaths, disappearances, and felony convictions of people who are simply moving themselves to create a better life have become normalized.”</p>

<p>Correction: Jan. 24, 2018</p>

<p>An earlier version of this story said that eight members of the group No More Deaths had been charged with federal crimes in recent months for their involvement in humanitarian activities near the U.S.-Mexico border. The number was based on information from the group as well as an attorney representing activists in court (the U.S Attorney’s Office did not respond to a request for comment). The story has been corrected to reflect that nine No More Deaths members have been charged with crimes in recent months.</p>

<p id="byline">by: Zaid Jilani</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-15</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/15/martin-luther-king-jr-mlk-day-2018/ </p>

<p>In 1999, the polling agency Gallup set out to determine the individuals Americans most admired in the 20th century.</p>

<p>Mother Teresa came in first, with 49 percent of Americans putting her at the top; the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., ranked second, with 34 percent placing him on the same list. But, the polling agency would later write, “King was far from universally revered during his lifetime.” They noted that in 1966, 63 percent of Americans held a negative view of the civil rights leader, while just 32 percent held a positive one. This was a marked reversal from five years earlier, when 41 percent of Americans gave King a positive rating and 37 percent a negative one.</p>

<p>King’s slide in popularity coincided with his activism taking a turn from what Americans largely know him for — his campaign for civil rights in the American South — to a much more radical one aimed at the war in Vietnam and poverty.</p>

<p>Refusing to Choose Between Civil Rights for African-Americans and Peace for Vietnamese</p>

<p>For years, King had been troubled by the war in Vietnam and raised it privately in conversations with the Democratic President Lyndon Johnson. As the conflict dragged on, King felt he had no choice but to publicly denounce the war.</p>

<p>In an April 1967 speech at Riverside Church in New York City, the civil rights leader publicly denounced American involvement in Indochina.</p>

<p>“This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation’s homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love,” he warned. “A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.”</p>

<p>Many in King’s inner circle warned against making the speech and publicly campaigning against the war. Their argument was that Johnson had risked his neck for the African-American community on issues like civil rights, health care, and welfare, and publicly condemning his foreign policy would irreparably harm the relationship between black activists and the president.</p>

<p>“We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation, for those it calls ‘enemy,’ for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers.”</p>

<p>King reserved a section of his remarks to address these critics. He labeled the war an “enemy of the poor,” saying that its budget was draining anti-poverty programs; he also pointed out that it was hypocritical for him to preach nonviolence to activists at home, while watching his government reject that principle abroad. But ultimately his stance came from personal moral conviction and his devoted Christian beliefs. “Beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of sonship and brotherhood. Because I believe that the Father is deeply concerned, especially for His suffering and helpless and outcast children, I come tonight to speak for them,” he said. “This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties, which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation’s self-defined goals and positions. We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation, for those it calls ‘enemy,’ for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers.”</p>

<p>The backlash from a liberal establishment that had once praised King for his civil rights campaign came as hard and fast as his allies had feared.</p>

<p>The New York Times editorial board lambasted King for linking the war in Vietnam to the struggles of civil rights and poverty alleviation in the United States, saying it was “too facile a connection” and that he was doing a “disservice” to both causes. It concluded that there “are no simple answers to the war in Vietnam or to racial injustice in this country.” The Washington Post editorial board said King had “diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country and his people.” A political cartoon in the Kansas City Star depicted the civil rights movement as a young black girl crying and begging for her drunk father King, who is consuming the contents of a bottle labeled “Anti-Vietnam.”</p>

<p>In all, 168 newspapers denounced him the next day. Johnson ended his formal relationship with King. “What is that goddamned nigger preacher doing to me?” Johnson reportedly remarked after the Riverside speech. “We gave him the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we gave him the Voting Rights Act of 1965, we gave him the war on poverty. What more does he want?”</p>

<p>The African-American establishment, fearful of Johnson’s reaction, also distanced itself from King.</p>

<p>The NAACP under the leadership of Roy Wilkins refused to oppose the war and explicitly condemned the effort to link the peace and civil rights movements. Whitney Young, the leader of the National Urban League, warned that “Johnson needs a consensus. If we are not with him on Vietnam, then he is not going to be with us on civil rights.” Jackie Robinson, the celebrated African-American baseball player and civil rights advocate, wrote to Johnson two weeks after King’s speech to distance himself from the civil rights leader: “While I am certain your faith has been shaken by demonstrations against the Viet Nam war, I hope the actions of any one individual does not make you feel as Vice President Humphrey does, that Dr. King’s stand will hurt the civil rights movement. It would not be fair to the thousands of our Negro fighting men who are giving their lives because they believe, in most instances, that our Viet Nam stand is just.” Many donors to the Southern Christian Leadership Conference wrote to King announcing they were pulling their support.</p>

<p>As he alienated the liberal establishment for his campaign against the Vietnam War, King also planned to mobilize mass demonstrations and civil disobedience aimed not at his old foes in the segregationist South, but politicians north of the Mason Dixon line who he believed were failing to act to stop endemic poverty. In August 1967, he told the SCLC that he was calling for activists to “dislocate” northern cities with nonviolent civil disobedience campaigns demanding action on federal aid. He said he would consider tactics, such as school boycotts, blocking plant gates with unemployed African-Americans, and mass sit-ins in federal buildings.</p>

<p>The New York Times, a steady ally of King’s civil disobedience campaign in the South, was furious. Two days after King’s SCLC address, the editorial board called his idea a “formula for discord.” The paper complained that there is an “inherent contradiction in Dr. King’s summons to Negroes to act ‘peacefully but forcefully to cripple the operations of an oppressive society.’ He himself has acknowledged that nonviolence is losing its appeal; once the spark of massive law-defiance is applied in the present overheated atmosphere, the potential for disaster becomes overwhelming.”</p>

<p>But King was never an advocate for violence. Although some on the left in King’s time and today argue about the utility of violence, King spent much of the end of his life trying to prevent the rioting and violent unrest that the Times was so concerned about. In February 1968, he warned during a tour through Alabama that increased rioting could lead to a “right-wing takeover.” He pointed to segregationist George Wallace’s presidential bid, saying, “Every time a riot develops, it helps George Wallace.” Defending his threat to take poverty protests to the doorsteps of the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, he portrayed nonviolence as a sort of middle path between acquiescence and violence. “We need an alternative to riots and to timid supplication,” he said.</p>

<p>Also that year, he launched the Poor People’s Campaign, aimed at providing good jobs, housing, and a decent standard of living to all Americans. More than 40 years before American protesters took to the streets of New York City and other locales to “occupy” space to protest inequality, King proposed a massive tent encampment in Washington, D.C. to demand action on poverty. King was assassinated during a campaign to organize sanitation workers in Tennessee in April of that year, before he was able to set up the encampment. His widow Coretta Scott King, as well as fellow civil rights leader Ralph David Abernathy, went ahead with the plan to create what they called Resurrection City.</p>

<p>The camp lasted six weeks until police moved in to shut it down and evict all of its inhabitants, pointing to sporadic acts of hooliganism as justification. Andrew Young, the young civil rights leader who later went on to be Jimmy Carter’s U.N. ambassador and a mayor of Atlanta, was horrified, saying the crushing of the camp was worse than the police violence he saw in the South. “It was worse than anything I saw in Mississippi or Alabama,” he said. “You don’t shoot tear gas into an entire city because two or three hooligans are throwing rocks.”</p>

<p>Following King’s assassination, the mood shifted quickly. Johnson, who had once terminated all communication with King and privately cursed his name, issued a statement saying the “heart of America is heavy, the spirit of America weeps” following the activist’s death. Georgia’s segregationist Gov. Lester Maddox, a frequent critic of King, even begrudgingly allowed Georgia’s flag to fly at half mast following his death. Bobby Kennedy, who once authorized the wiretaps of King’s phones, attended the funeral.</p>

<p>“He gave his life for the poor of the world — the garbage workers of Memphis and the peasants of Vietnam.”</p>

<p>Coretta Scott King’s greatest concern was not for her husband’s image, but how his legacy would be carried on after his death. Rioting rocked major American cities following King’s assassination, and she feared that the nonviolence he had preached would be lost in the embers.</p>

<p>The Sunday following the assassination, she spoke at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta and implored his movement to continue to act as he would for the causes he believed in:</p>

<p>Our concern now is that his work does not die. He gave his life for the poor of the world — the garbage workers of Memphis and the peasants of Vietnam. Nothing could hurt him more than that man could attempt no way to solve problems except through violence. He gave his life in search of a more excellent way, a more effective way, a creative way rather than a destructive way.</p>

<p>We intend to go on in search of that way, and I hope that you who loved and admired him would join us in fulfilling his dream.</p>

<p>The day that Negro people and others in bondage are truly free, on the day want is abolished, on the day wars are no more, on that day I know my husband well rest in a long-deserved peace.</p>

<h2 id="floridaprisonerspreparetostrikedemandinganendtounpaidlaborandbrutalconditions">Florida Prisoners Prepare to Strike, Demanding an End to Unpaid Labor and Brutal Conditions</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alice Speri</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-13</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/14/florida-prison-strike-unpaid-labor-brutal-conditions/ </p>

<p>Florida prisoners are calling for a general strike to start this week — marking the third mass action over the course of a year in protest of inhumane conditions in the state’s detention facilities. Detainees in at least eight prisons have declared their intention to stop all work on Monday — Martin Luther King Jr. Day — to demand an end to unpaid labor and price gouging in prison commissaries, as well as the restoration of parole, among other requests.</p>

<p>Coordinated, nonviolent prison protests, as well as spontaneous uprisings amid deteriorating conditions, have escalated in recent years both nationwide and in Florida, which has the third-largest prison system in the country. Prisoners in the state were among the most active during a nationwide strike in September 2016, which was quickly dubbed the “largest prison strike in U.S. history.” At least 10 Florida prisons participated in that action, which was planned to coincide with the 45th anniversary of the Attica prison uprising but started a day early when tensions flared at Holmes Correctional Institution in the Florida Panhandle. Then, in August, in response to prison activists’ calls for another show of dissent, Department of Corrections officials placed the entire state system — 143 facilities and 97,000 people — on lockdown, an unprecedented move.</p>

<p>Incarcerated organizers of this week’s strike have chosen to remain anonymous to prevent retaliation, but they shared a statement outlining their demands with outside supporters. In an audio message from prison shared with The Intercept, one of the organizers described the action as a “nonviolent protest to get what we deserve from our government.”</p>

<p>“They use wordplay and deceive the public about what really goes on inside the system, and we want to expose those things,” he said.</p>

<p>Prison officials regularly retaliate against organizers by restricting their visitation rights and contact with other inmates, and sometimes even moving them to different facilities, which makes it harder for reports of protests to reach the public. But despite the challenges, “prisoners are pretty well-organized and coordinated inside the prisons and throughout the prison system,” said Panagioti Tsolkas, an organizer with the prisoners’ rights and environmentalist group Campaign to Fight Toxic Prisons. Tsolkas, who communicates regularly with activists inside, said some of the upcoming strike’s organizers have already been placed in solitary confinement in retaliation for their efforts.</p>

<p>In response to questions about the planned strike, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections wrote in a statement to The Intercept that “the department will continue to ensure the safe operation of our correctional institutions.”</p>

<p>“Slave Labor” and Price Gouging</p>

<p>Florida prisoners work both inside the prisons — doing laundry, cooking, maintaining the facilities, and growing food — and on outside “community work squads.” According to the corrections department, in 2017 the latter group alone performed 3.15 million hours of work valued at more than $38 million statewide, including cleanup work after Hurricane Irma.</p>

<p>“Our goal is to make the governor realize that it will cost the state of Florida millions of dollars daily to contract outside companies to come and cook, clean, and handle the maintenance,” the prisoners wrote in their statement. “This will cause a total BREAK DOWN.”</p>

<p>Prisoners are demanding compensation for their work as opposed to “the current slave arrangement,” they wrote, in which they are paid in time deducted from their sentences. “A lot of times people will work in order to get time deducted, and then the prison guards and officials will find ways to punish someone for what the prisoners are saying are made up reasons that then extend the person’s time,” Jacqueline Azis, an attorney with the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Intercept.</p>

<p>“We want to be paid for the work we do, so that somebody doesn’t end up spending 10, 15, 20 years not being paid, and sent home with a bus ticket and a $50 check,” the prisoner speaking in the recording said. “We want to create an environment where someone can do their time, be rehabilitated, and enter into society with some type of hope.”</p>

<p>“That would be helpful for society instead of creating a revolving door where you lock people up and just set them up for failure so that they keep coming back.”</p>

<p>Prisoners are also calling for fairer pricing of goods they can purchase in prison — claiming, for example, that a case of soup that costs $4 on the outside is sold for $17 by prison commissaries (the DOC disputed that claim and provided the following list of canteen prices).</p>

<p>“This is highway robbery without a gun,” the prisoners wrote. “It’s not just us that they’re taking from. It’s our families who struggle to make ends meet and send us money — they are the real victims that the state of Florida is taking advantage of.”</p>

<p>Strike organizers are also calling on Florida to restore parole — which the state eliminated for non-capital felonies in 1984. “When someone is sentenced to life in prison, it means life in prison in Florida,” said Azis. “There is no chance that good behavior in prison will get someone out earlier.”</p>

<p>The lack of parole has compounded the system’s colossal overcrowding, which in turn has contributed to some of the harshest and most violent prison conditions in the country. “There are so many unexplained deaths,” Lisa Graybill, deputy legal director for criminal justice reform at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told The Intercept. “They’re just appalling.”</p>

<p>Deaths in Florida state prisons — including homicides and a spate of suicides — have skyrocketed in recent years, soaring from 191 in 2000 to 356 in 2016.</p>

<p>Among those killed in custody was Darren Rainey, a mentally ill prisoner who was scalded to death at Dade Correctional Institution in 2012 when guards locked him in a hot shower for two hours. The water reached temperatures as high as 180 degrees, according to witnesses, including a nurse on duty that night who said that the heat controls were in a neighboring room controlled by guards.</p>

<p>Following Rainey’s death, a devastating investigation by the Miami Herald detailed more unexplained and brutal deaths, as well as system-wide neglect and abuse and efforts to cover up prison officials’ wrongdoing. Randall Jordan-Aparo, an inmate with disabilities at Franklin Correctional Institution, was killed in 2010 when guards beat him and gassed him with a chemical agent after he begged for medical help for days (prison guards later took to Facebook to mock his death). Another prisoner allegedly hanged herself while her hands were tied.</p>

<p>The corrections department has also been sued over its treatment of prisoners with disabilities and its failure to treat prisoners with hepatitis C, and rights groups have called on the Department of Justice — twice — to open a federal civil rights investigation into the state’s prisons. “These problems are chronic,” Graybill said. “They haven’t been addressed and they’re not going away.”</p>

<p>Like most other states, Florida went on an “incarceration binge” in the 1990s, Graybill said. But unlike most other states — some 36 of which have undertaken some kind of criminal justice reform — the state has consistently refused to reconsider its policies.</p>

<p>“The solution for Florida is clear,” she said. “It needs to improve the conditions of confinement in its facilities, and one way it can afford to do that is by ensuring that it is only incarcerating the people who truly need to be incarcerated.”</p>

<p>“The question becomes, Why has the legislature been so unwilling or unable to do that?”</p>

<p>“This Is Florida … We’ll Beat Your Ass!”</p>

<p>In addition to denouncing brutal conditions of confinement, the prisoners are demanding broader criminal justice reform in Florida — including restored voting rights and a moratorium on executions.</p>

<p>Florida is one of four states in the country — with Kentucky, Iowa, and Virginia — that imposes lifetime disenfranchisement for people convicted of felonies. That means 1.5 million state residents can’t vote because of their criminal history. “People who have already paid their debt to society are essentially prevented from being active citizens,” said Azis, the ACLU lawyer.</p>

<p>A proposed constitutional amendment could change that — if it can garner enough support to get on the ballot — but until that passes, the only potential path to the vote is for each disenfranchised individual to personally appeal to the governor, Rick Scott. Scott grants only 8 percent of those appeals, with little transparency on the decision-making process and a backlog of 10,000 applications awaiting review, the New York Times recently reported. The process leaves restoration of the right to vote dependent on the governor’s personal convictions. In a hearing on the voting rights of a man who had been convicted of manslaughter in a drunken driving incident, for instance, Scott said he would need to think about it — then noted, with his mic accidentally still on, “That’s how my uncle died.”</p>

<p>Scott also wields disproportionate power when it comes to the state’s death penalty. After newly elected prosecutor Aramis Ayala — Florida’s first black state attorney – said she would not seek the death penalty in her district, which includes Orlando, Scott moved 29 potential capital cases to a different jurisdiction. Ayala appealed, but the state’s Supreme Court ruled in the governor’s favor, forcing her to walk back her ban. Last year, Florida moved to tighten its death penalty laws by requiring a unanimous jury verdict after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the previous sentencing protocol was unconstitutional. The move made dozens of people eligible for re-sentencing, but the state limited retroactive application to those sentenced after 2002 — leaving approximately 200 on death row with sentences ineligible for review.</p>

<p>Finally, prisoners planning the strike are joining the local community’s protest against a phosphate mine set to surround the Reception and Medical Center near Lake Butler, where new arrivals and inmates with medical conditions are housed. Residents and prisoners fear the health consequences of water contamination and exposure to potential carcinogens linked to phosphate mining.</p>

<p>Kevin “Rashid” Johnson arrived at the Reception and Medical Center last spring.</p>

<p>Johnson, a well-known prison activist, jailhouse lawyer, and prolific writer and critic of prison abuse, had already been moved from Virginia to Texas under an interstate agreement that allows for the transfer of prisoners — ostensibly for public safety reasons, but often as a punitive measure.</p>

<p>That Johnson would be transferred to Florida “is a piece of evidence of how the Florida prison system is viewed even by the prison industry itself,” said Tsolkas, who has been communicating with him ahead of the upcoming strike. “Appalachia wasn’t bad enough. Texas wasn’t bad enough. Well, you’re going to the swamps.”</p>

<p>At the RMC, Johnson wrote in July, a guard told him that he was “not in Virginia, or wherever else” he might have been previously. “You will answer us only as ‘no sir’ and ‘yessir,’ ‘no ma’am’ and ‘yes ma’am.’ You forget this and we’ll kick your fucking teeth out,” the guard said, according to Johnson. “This is Florida, and we’ll beat your ass! We’ll kill you!”</p>

<p>That didn’t stop Johnson from continuing to expose prison abuse in Florida, or from joining the state prisoners’ organizing efforts, including ahead of Monday’s strike.</p>

<p>“What the prisoners are asking for is not only completely reasonable, but should be the bare minimum of how we treat an individual that the state is in charge of caring for,” said Azis. “I would hope that whatever the DOC’s response is, it is an ethical and responsible way of addressing these real concerns.”</p>

<h2 id="thejusticedepartmenthelpedacountyprosecutortargetthefacebookrecordsofantipipelineactivists">The Justice Department Helped a County Prosecutor Target the Facebook Records of Anti-Pipeline Activists</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Simon Davis-Cohen</p>

<p>Nine months after pipeline opponents in Washington state staged a protest that blocked freeway traffic, Facebook ended a protracted legal standoff with a county prosecutor, turning over detailed records on the indigenous-led group behind the demonstration. Despite the fact that no criminal charges have been filed in connection with the February action, Whatcom County Prosecuting Attorney David McEachran repeatedly sought a warrant for the group’s Facebook page, ultimately securing private information including messages to and from the page and a list of everyone “invited” to the protest event.</p>

<p>McEachran’s first two warrant applications were withdrawn after the American Civil Liberties Union and Facebook raised objections. On the third try, however, the warrant was granted thanks to Facebook’s suggestion that McEachran’s office seek formal guidance from the nation’s top law enforcement agency, the Department of Justice. A public records request filed by The Intercept shows that the local agency and its federal counterpart cooperated to draft the ultimately successful warrant using a DOJ template.</p>

<p>Activists affiliated with the climate justice group, Red Line Salish Sea, view the investigation as retaliation for their February protest, a march against local fossil fuel projects and President Donald Trump’s executive orders expediting construction of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. “Not only does this warrant attempt to scare people from organizing, this warrant attempts to scare people from even looking at information,” Tina McKim, an administrator of Red Line’s Facebook page, wrote in a declaration.</p>

<p>The DOJ’s intervention in the case makes it the latest example of the Trump administration’s direct involvement in law enforcement actions against protesters who allege they are being targeted for protected First Amendment activity: On the other side of the country, the DOJ is pursuing decades of prison time for protesters, journalists, medics, and legal advocates arrested during the anti-Trump “J20” demonstrations on Inauguration Day. In that case, too, the prosecution secured warrants for the Facebook page and website used to organize the protests. Now, Standing Rock-inspired activists in Whatcom County find themselves on the front lines of the battle over Americans’ right to anonymously organize with political groups.</p>

<p>The search warrant that Whatcom County prosecutors ultimately secured for the Facebook page of the anti-pipeline group Red Line Salish Sea.</p>

<p>The case began on February 11, three weeks after Trump took office. Red Line Salish Sea, formerly known as the Bellingham NoDAPL Coalition, organized a march to oppose Trump’s executive orders as well as proposed fuel export facilities in the Pacific Northwest. (The group’s name refers to the Salish Sea, which extends from Olympia, Washington, into Canada; activists consider the region a red line that new fossil fuel expansion should not cross.) About 100 protesters eventually made their way to Interstate 5, where they slowly brought traffic to a stop. Though the protest blocked traffic for an hour, no arrests were made and demonstrators were allowed to peacefully disperse.</p>

<p>However, a driver a few miles south of the march was cited for “inattentive driving” after colliding with a vehicle that was slowing down for the traffic jam, causing it to bump into another vehicle. Two minor injuries — “soreness in shoulders” and a seat belt-inflicted injury to the sternum — resulted from the accident. Five days later, the prosecutor’s office launched a disorderly conduct and reckless endangerment investigation into the protest, citing the collision as well as the case of a man stuck in traffic who was forced to urinate in a bottle. The county sought the identity of organizers and proof that they coordinated and concealed a deliberate plan to block the freeway while disregarding the risks involved. The investigation’s first step: serving Facebook with a warrant for Red Line’s Facebook page, including all messages, photos, videos, wall posts, and location information associated with the page before and after the protest.</p>

<p>That first warrant was withdrawn by McEachran in March after the ACLU argued it would chill political speech and violate basic First Amendment protections by seeking “data related to an unknown number of individuals who merely interacted with the group via Facebook.” More than 900 individuals or organizations “liked” Red Line’s Facebook page, the ACLU noted, and many more potentially communicated with the page in other ways. A second warrant more narrowly focused on content related to the I-5 demonstration was soon submitted and approved by Whatcom County Superior Court Judge Charles Snyder, but it too was withdrawn after Facebook insisted it was too specific and the company could not filter results but could only provide “categories” of information.</p>

<p>Then, according to testimony by McEachran’s deputy prosecutor, Facebook suggested the county reach out to the Department of Justice for help in drafting a third warrant. Emails obtained via public records request show that in May, senior DOJ attorney Jared Hosid exchanged drafts of the third warrant with Whatcom County Sheriff’s Detective John Allgire. Hosid gave specific advice on how to word the warrant, which was based on a template provided by the department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.</p>

<p>The Intercept sent a letter seeking comment to McEachran’s office, which does not communicate with the media by phone or email, but has not received a response. The DOJ did not respond to request for comment. When asked about the advice Facebook provided to county prosecutors, a spokesperson for the company said Facebook has a law enforcement outreach team that fields questions from law enforcement about company policy.</p>

<p>McEachran’s investigation seeks evidence of minor crimes, but Larry Hildes, a public interest attorney representing Red Line and two administrators of the group’s Facebook page, views the prospect of reckless endangerment charges as disproportionate to the facts of the case. “Firing a gun into the air above a crowd or driving a car at someone to intimidate them and then swerving out of the way, that’s reckless endangerment,” he says. “Peacefully walking onto a street is not.”</p>

<p>A month after the protest, McEachran live-streamed into the state Capitol to testify in favor of an economic disruption bill that would allow Washington’s law enforcement agencies to thwart protests with criminal charges conferring significant prison time. The bill, since defeated, would have made obstructing commerce (or planning a protest that obstructed commerce) a class C felony, punishable with up to five years in prison. McEachran, Whatcom County Sheriff Bill Elfo, and the local State Patrol chief pointed to Red Line’s protest as proof of the bill’s necessity.</p>

<p>They were not alone: In 2017, sweeping domestic terrorism bills increasing penalties for protests that “disable” streets, public buildings, or critical infrastructure were passed in Georgia and Florida. According to the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, new protest suppression bills have also been passed in Oklahoma, South Dakota, North Dakota, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Now, model legislation is being pushed in state legislatures by the influential American Legislative Exchange Council to further criminalize pipeline protests.</p>

<p>This view of protests as quintessentially criminal conduct, rather than protected First Amendment activity, was captured in the explicit justification McEachran’s office provided for its investigation of Red Line’s February action, according to a legal brief filed by Hildes. “The state seeks to justify [the warrant] by comparing this situation to the infamous D.C. sniper incident,” the brief notes, referring to a series of attacks in 2002 in which hidden snipers evaded law enforcement for three weeks, killing 10 and wounding three.</p>

<p>“The warrant and the county’s pleadings do not so much as acknowledge the existence of the First Amendment, nor that this was a demonstration, but simply treat it as supposed criminal activity like a bar fight or drunk driving,” Hildes wrote.</p>

<p>Merely granting the warrant, Hildes argued, would immediately violate people’s rights to anonymously associate with a political group. He cited the landmark 1958 Supreme Court decision NAACP v. Alabama, which secured the right to “associational privacy.” The court ruled Alabama could not force the NAACP to turn over a list of its members, which the state had demanded in the midst of its unsuccessful effort to close down the group’s state chapter. “Privacy in group association,” the court wrote, “may in many circumstances be indispensable to preservation of freedom of association, particularly where a group espouses dissident beliefs.”</p>

<p>But on November 17, the Washington Court of Appeals denied Hildes’s effort to halt the warrant, saying the NAACP precedent did not apply. The warrant handed over all stored content, including deleted content, associated with Red Line’s Facebook page from February 5 to February 15, including Facebook account names and ID numbers of everyone “going,” “interested,” and “invited” to the February 11 event; personally identifiable information on all administrators or moderators of the page; all status updates, messages, videos, photographs, articles, wall postings, event postings, comments, and tags; and images or videos shared by, posted to, and uploaded to the page.</p>

<p>The court concluded that the warrant’s use of an independent “privilege team” to process the data would shield personal and First Amendment-protected information not related to McEachran’s criminal investigation. According to the testimony of Whatcom’s deputy prosecutor, it was the DOJ’s idea to set up the independent team that ensured Facebook’s compliance with the warrant.</p>

<p>“We were … assured that an independent team will review and separate out only the relevant data for the criminal investigation,” Facebook told The Intercept. The setup is similar to the court-appointed “special master” requested by the ACLU after the D.C. Superior Court gave the federal government access to the Facebook page used by organizers of the J20 Inauguration Day protests. In the end, the court did not grant the ACLU’s request in the J20 case, but it did restrict the warrant by requiring some prior redaction by Facebook and court-approved protocols for how the prosecution could search the page. (The J20 warrant was filed after nearly 200 people were charged with felony crimes, however, whereas the Whatcom warrant was justified only by McEachran’s misdemeanor investigation.)</p>

<p>In Whatcom, there is reason to doubt the independent team will truly shield people’s First Amendment activity from government oversight — because the team consists of a prosecutor and an outside detective appointed by McEachran’s office, the Washington State Patrol, the Whatcom County Sheriff’s Office, and the Bellingham Police Department.</p>

<p>The court’s November 17 decision also found that the two administrators of Red Line’s Facebook page represented by Hildes did not have legal standing to seek to quash the third warrant. The only entity that had that privilege, according to the court, was Facebook, which passed on the opportunity.</p>

<p>In the J20 case as well, Facebook users and third parties did not have standing to intervene legally to quash the Facebook warrants. Scott Michelman, an attorney at the ACLU of D.C. who was involved in challenging the J20 warrants, thinks that limiting standing to warrant recipients makes it too difficult for platform users to protect their privacy. “[Facebook] users and third parties should be able to protect their own rights in court. Courts should be open to these types of challenges, or else everyone has to rely on Facebook,” he said.</p>

<p>Facebook does not have a universal policy on challenging warrants in court. “We scrutinize every request for user data and push back when they are legally deficient or overly broad,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept, pointing to a 2014 example in which the company sought to challenge a warrant that demanded “nearly all data” from the accounts of 381 people, 62 of whom were later charged with disability fraud.</p>

<p>In the Whatcom case, after being held in contempt of court for not complying with the warrant on time, and facing the onset of a $2,000 per day sanction, Facebook handed over the data to McEachran’s office on November 20. “We notified the affected people and held off on complying with the warrants while two courts heard and rejected their claims,” the Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept.</p>

<p>In its decision, the Washington Court of Appeals argued that one reason the NAACP precedent did not apply was that unlike in NAACP, those targeted by the Whatcom warrant would not face “economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of physical coercion, and other manifestations of public hostility” as a result of their association with Red Line being exposed.</p>

<p>Michelle Vendiola, a member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe and an administrator of Red Line’s Facebook page, begs to differ. After the freeway protest, activists associated with the anti-pipeline group were the recipients of a surge of online harassment; commenters suggested they should have been run over and posted their personal information on the internet. A photo of Vendiola’s business card circulated online, leading to an influx of public pressure on her employer, Western Washington University, to fire her. The incident led a senior assistant to the university president to publicly condemn the protest as an “illegal act” and “counterproductive.” Western Washington University did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Around that time, the Washington State Patrol filed a freedom of information request for all of Vendiola’s email communications and web history stored on university computers and servers. One of her colleagues also initiated an ethics investigation, alleging she used public resources to organize the February protest. After the state searched her work computer, email communications, and web history, the investigation concluded that no violation had occurred. In July, however, the university did not renew her contract.</p>

<p>“They’re specifically trying to find evidence to bring charges against me,” Vendiola said of the prosecutor’s office. “It’s really frustrating to wait and wonder.” The statute of limitations for filing disorderly conduct charges against the protesters expires next month, on February 11.</p>

<p>Despite McEachran’s ongoing investigation and the possibility of charges looming, Red Line has continued to organize. Along with fundraising and preparing for any future legal fights, the group is supporting the Puyallup Tribe’s opposition to a liquefied natural gas export facility in Tacoma, Washington. And to the north, members are fundraising for the Unist’ot’en Camp, which is blocking multiple pipelines on unceded indigenous lands in British Columbia.</p>

<p>The climate for anti-pipeline organizing across the country could hardly be more threatening. McEachran’s third warrant was granted just after the Justice Department vowed to prosecute protesters who damage pipelines — and members of Congress and the American Petroleum Institute urged the agency to classify those activists as domestic terrorists.</p>

<p>This context informs Hildes’s suspicion that the reckless endangerment charges are a red herring. “The county prosecutor’s office now has the internal organizing records of a political group they don’t like,” Hildes told The Intercept. “This is not about a peaceful demonstration on the freeway anymore. This is about how do you intimidate and suppress dissent — that’s what it’s been about the whole time.”</p>

<h2 id="mrpresidentareyouaracististhequestionreportersshouldneverstopaskingdonaldtrump">“Mr. President, Are You a Racist?” Is the Question Reporters Should Never Stop Asking Donald Trump</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Robert Mackey</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-12</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/12/mr-president-racist-right-question-ask-trump-shithole-slur/ </p>

<p>After bizarrely offering his “congratulations” to the late Martin Luther King Jr. at the White House on Friday, President Donald Trump was asked for the first time by reporters to explain why he referred to Haiti and some African nations as “shithole countries,” during talks about immigration a day earlier.</p>

<p>An error occurred.</p>

<p>“Mr. President, will you give an apology for the statement yesterday?” Trump was asked by April Ryan, Washington bureau chief for American Urban Radio, as he turned to leave the ceremony honoring the civil rights leader. When Trump ignored the question, a second reporter asked, “Did you use the word ‘shithole’ to refer to African nations?”</p>

<p>Ryan then cut to the point, asking Trump the question that should be repeated every day from now until the end of his term: “Mr. President, are you a racist?”</p>

<p>When Trump again ignored the question, Ryan repeated it — a fact lost on anyone who followed the event on the live video stream on the White House web site, since it abruptly cut out at that point, though C-SPAN continued to broadcast the event.</p>

<p>Since Trump lies so easily and has previously called himself the planet’s “least-racist person,” there might seem to be little point in pressing him to answer Ryan’s question. But, as reporters in the Netherlands demonstrated this week, asking politicians who make offensive statements to account for their remarks can be a public service, by at least attaching some sort of social embarrassment to making such comments.</p>

<p>That Trump did indeed refer, repeatedly, to those nations as “shithole countries” was confirmed on Friday by Sen. Dick Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who was in the room when the president complained that people from those nations should not be welcomed as immigrants.</p>

<p>An error occurred.</p>

<p>“President Trump said things that were hate-filled, vile, and racist,” Durbin told television reporters. “He used those words repeatedly.”</p>

<p>When Durbin was asked later about a tweet from Trump, in which he seemed to deny using the word “shithole,” the senator said, “I stand by what I said. If the president disputes it, then … well, it’s not the truth.”</p>

<p>Durbin also revealed that one Republican in the room, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, took issue with Trump’s comments. Graham acknowledged as much in a statement released later on Friday, saying that he offered an affirmation of the multicultural roots of the United States.</p>

<h2 id="privateprisoncontinuestosendicedetaineestosolitaryconfinementforrefusingvoluntarylabor">Private Prison Continues to Send ICE Detainees to Solitary Confinement for Refusing Voluntary Labor</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Spencer Woodman</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-10</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/11/ice-detention-solitary-confinement/ </p>

<p>Officials at a privately run Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in rural Georgia locked an immigrant detainee in solitary confinement last November as punishment for encouraging fellow detainees to stop working in a labor program that ICE says is strictly voluntary.</p>

<p>Shoaib Ahmed, a 24-year-old who immigrated to America to escape political persecution in Bangladesh, told The Intercept that the privately run detention center placed him in isolation for 10 days after an officer overheard him simply saying “no work tomorrow.” Ahmed said he was expressing frustration over the detention center — run by prison contractor CoreCivic — having delayed his weekly paycheck of $20 for work in the facility’s kitchen.</p>

<p>Those in ICE custody often work for as little as $1 per day and cannot legally be compelled to work.</p>

<p>Ahmed’s account adds to a growing chorus of ICE detainees who allege that they have been forced to work in for-profit ICE facilities or else risk punishment with solitary confinement — a harsh form of captivity that, if prolonged, can amount to torture. Late last month, ICE detainees at a CoreCivic-run facility in California sued the private prison contractor, alleging that they had been threatened with solitary confinement if they did not work. In October, The Intercept reported that officials had placed another detainee in solitary confinement for 30 days for “encouraging others to participate in a work stoppage” at the same privately run facility where Ahmed was disciplined, the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia.</p>

<p>CoreCivic has said that its practices of segregating detainees in individual cells are humane and has disputed the term “solitary confinement,” arguing that its harsh connotation does not apply to the publicly traded firm’s practices. “Use of the term in your coverage with regard to Stewart would give readers a false impression of the reality of restricted housing at the facility,” CoreCivic spokesperson Jonathan Burns said in an email.</p>

<p>But over the course of two interviews with The Intercept over a fuzzy detention center phone line, Ahmed used rudimentary English to describe being subjected to the isolating conditions of solitary confinement as it is generally understood. “The room is at all times locked,” Ahmed said. “If you talk, the sound does not go outside. And nobody comes to talk with us.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I think I will be mentally sick,” Ahmed said of his time in isolation. “I feel pain in my head.”</p>

<p>In addition to severe isolation, Ahmed spoke of being subjected to restrictive treatment in segregation that might be more expected for a violent and volatile criminal than for an immigration detainee under punishment for encouraging a work stoppage.</p>

<p>Once a day, detention center officers would handcuff Ahmed and escort him outdoors for an hour in a recreation yard — which he described as a “cage” for one person. Three times a week, Ahmed and other detainees in solitary confinement were given the opportunity to shower. This meant being guided in handcuffs from his isolation cell to an individual shower room. “They push you into the shower room and then open the handcuffs,” Ahmed said, adding: “You take a shower and after that, you come back in your room. Then they put you back in the room. When you enter the room again, they open the handcuffs.”</p>

<p>Ahmed said that because no one outside his room could hear him talk at a regular volume, his only opportunity for human interaction would often be to shout out, though he was prohibited from raising his voice — an infraction that would only cause his sentence in isolation to be extended. “Sometimes I think my head is not working, and I think I want to loudly call them: ‘Release me. Please, take me to some open site,’” Ahmed recalled. “Sometimes I think the segregation will kill me.”</p>

<p>Burns, the CoreCivic spokesperson, provided no specifics in response to questions about Ahmed’s treatment and asserted that the firm strictly adheres to national detention standards. “Providing a safe, humane and appropriate environment for those entrusted to our care is our top priority, and we work in close coordination with our partners at ICE to ensure the well-being of the detainees at Stewart Detention Center,” Burns said. Burns also provided a list of amenities made available to detainees in solitary confinement, which includes access to the law library, meals, the facility barber shop, mail, shaving, pay phones, and visitation “without mechanical restraints.”</p>

<p>Ahmed’s long journey to the isolation cell in Lumpkin, Georgia, began with political repression in Bangladesh, where after receiving a college degree in business administration, Ahmed became active in the primary opposition party to the country’s increasingly authoritarian government. Human Rights Watch and other humanitarian groups have documented the government’s jailing and killing of political opponents, including disappearances of members of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, to which Ahmed belonged. Fearing a similar fate, Ahmed decided to flee to America.</p>

<p>After landing in Bolivia in the spring of 2016, Ahmed began an arduous, 3,000-mile journey by land to the U.S. border. He spent six weeks making his way through jungles in South and Central America, where Ahmed said he had been robbed of everything he carried. Upon his arrival at the Texas border that August, federal authorities arrested Ahmed and a group of several other Bangladeshi immigrants, he said. “We didn’t see the police coming,” Ahmed told me. “I cross Panama Jungle, Colombian jungle, Peru jungle, and I come into the United States to save my life. But when I come, I come to Stewart Detention Center.”</p>

<p>ICE provided The Intercept with few specifics regarding Ahmed’s case but stated that the “use of restrictive housing in ICE detention facilities is exceedingly rare, but at times necessary, to ensure the safety of staff and individuals in a facility.” ICE has said that, apart from personal housekeeping, immigrant detainees work only on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>When Ahmed was placed in the Stewart isolation cell, he had been locked in ICE detention for well over a year. While his prolonged time in captivity represented hardship for Ahmed, his presence offered a source of cheap labor for CoreCivic. Ahmed said that he worked for 50 cents per hour as a cook in the dining hall kitchen primarily to afford long-distance calls to his family in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>In recent years, current and former ICE detainees have filed class-action lawsuits alleging forced labor against private prison contractors in Washington state, California, and Colorado. Across the country, detainees and advocates have said that the ICE contractors used solitary confinement as a cudgel to force work, and allege that the for-profit facility operators are profiting off the bonded labor.</p>

<p>“These big corporations are circumventing the traditional labor market,” said Lydia Wright, an attorney at the Burns Charest law firm who represents current and former ICE detainees suing CoreCivic in California. “If they weren’t requiring detainees to work for $1 per day, they would have to hire cooks and janitors at minimum wage.”</p>

<p>In an October response to a suit from detainees in Colorado, major private prison contractor GEO Group appeared to echo this point. “Were a court to conclude that GEO must pay thousands of detainees a minimum wage, it would significantly affect the prices that GEO would have charge for its services,” stated a GEO Group court filing. The Colorado class-action suit, which demands that detainees be paid minimum wage for their labor, “poses a potentially catastrophic risk to GEO’s ability to honor its contracts with the federal government,” the firm stated in a separate filing.</p>

<p>One obstacle such suits against ICE’s private contractors may face: Many of the immigrant plaintiffs are only fleetingly in the country before often being deported, making it potentially difficult, for instance, to find former detainees who may be entitled to back wages.</p>

<p>When I last spoke with Ahmed in late November, he said he had lost his case and expected to be deported back to Bangladesh in the coming weeks. When I asked if he could call me from his home country, he couldn’t make a commitment. “If I go back to Bangladesh, I don’t know where I will go,” Ahmed said. “Maybe they will put me in jail, or maybe they will force me to leave the country again.”</p>

<p>According to ICE’s online detainee locator, Ahmed remains housed at Stewart Detention Center.</p>

<h2 id="dutchreportersstuntrumpsambassadorbypressinghimtoadmitheliedaboutnogozones">Dutch Reporters Stun Trump’s Ambassador By Pressing Him to Admit He Lied About “No-Go Zones”</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Robert Mackey</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-10</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/10/dutch-reporters-stun-trumps-ambassador-pressing-admit-lied-no-go-zones/ </p>

<p>White House correspondents who routinely allow the president of the United States to repeat false claims unchallenged should study the footage of how their Dutch counterparts greeted Donald Trump’s new ambassador to the Netherlands on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Dutch reporters simply ignored a plea from the new U.S. ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, to forget all about the fact that there is video of him lying about their country in 2015. In the video, he insisted that parts of the Netherlands have been surrendered to Islamist radicals that supposedly rule over “no-go zones” for non-Muslims, where Dutch politicians have been set on fire.</p>

<p>After Hoekstra refused to answer one reporter’s direct question — “Are politicians being burned in the Netherlands … ? Is that something you believe, yes or no?” — his colleagues immediately followed up.</p>

<p>Today Dutch press welcomed @petehoekstra as new ambassador to the Netherlands. In 2015 Hoekstra said Dutch"politicians are being burned" (not true). The only one who did get burned today is… Hoekstra himself. By refusing to answer our questions. pic.twitter.com/Dv2aalbhDP</p>

<p>— Roel Geeraedts (@RGjournalist) January 10, 2018</p>

<p>“If you are truly an honest and wise man,” another journalist asked, “would you please take back the remark about burned politicians — or name a politician that was burned in the Netherlands?”</p>

<p>When Hoekstra, who was born in the Netherlands but raised in Michigan as a staunch social conservative, called for another question, two reporters asked him, “Why don’t you answer the question?” Another told the former member of U.S. Congress, “This is the Netherlands; you have to answer questions.”</p>

<p>After Hoekstra had presented his credentials to the Dutch king in the Hague on Wednesday, the former U.S. representative told reporters that he would be “moving on” from the controversy over his remarks.</p>

<p>But the reporters failed to play along, with one quickly asking, “Will you be visiting our ‘no-go areas?'”</p>

<p>Hoekstra had spectacularly failed to defuse the crisis in an interview in December, in which he told a reporter from the Dutch state broadcaster NOS that it was “fake news” to claim that he had said exactly what he had been recorded saying in 2015. Later in the same interview, Hoekstra stunned the reporter by claiming that he had not used the term “fake news” minutes earlier.</p>

<p>@Nieuwsuur to new US ambassador: "You mentioned [..] that there are no go-zones in the Netherlands and that cars and politicians are set on fire."</p>

<p>Pete Hoekstra: "I didn't say that. That's actually an incorrect statement [..] fake news."</p>

<p>Hmm, let's have a look at the footage ? pic.twitter.com/vlstN9vhSK</p>

<p>— Christiaan Triebert (@trbrtc) December 21, 2017</p>

<p>After that debacle, Hoekstra issued a statement in which he expressed “regret” for lying to the NOS program, Nieuwsuur. But he refused to retract his original comments about the entirely imaginary threat of non-Muslims being banned or attacked in areas of the Netherlands ruled according to Islamic Sharia.</p>

<p>The response of the Dutch press corps to Hoekstra’s lie contrasts sharply with how American reporters handled Trump’s false claim, also made in 2015, that he had watched on television as “thousands and thousands” of Muslims in New Jersey had cheered the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001.</p>

<p>While American news organizations comprehensively debunked Trump’s false claim — showing that there was no such footage of any mass celebration that day — reporters covering his campaign made only a few gentle attempts to confront him with the facts before they stopped asking about the lie entirely. Trump, let off the hook, assured his supporters that he had been vindicated and even mocked the physical disability of a reporter whose work undermined his account.</p>

<h2 id="dreamerswinincourtbutuntilcongressactstheirfuturesareasuncertainasever">Dreamers Win in Court, But Until Congress Acts, Their Futures Are as Uncertain as Ever</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Aída Chávez</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/10/daca-program-dreamers-trump-immigration-tps/ </p>

<p>A court ruling late Tuesday night stalling President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program appeared to be good news for the young immigrants known as Dreamers, who face deportation if the policy is terminated. But the decision is limited, and congressional negotiations to find a permanent solution for DACA are a mess.</p>

<p>San Francisco-based U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup granted a pretrial injunction that bars the administration from rescinding the program for the time being. Many groups representing DACA recipients have sued since September, when Trump canceled former President Barack Obama’s 2012 administrative program, which gives recipients renewable two-year protection against deportation, as well as work permit eligibility. Alsup ordered the administration to continue receiving requests for DACA renewals, but not to process new applications.</p>

<p>Some activists worry that the order, if it remains in place, could subvert the current legislative battle and cause Democrats to become complacent. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said the ruling “in no way diminishes the urgency of resolving the DACA issue,” adding that the only way to guarantee peace of mind and legal status for Dreamers is to pass it into law by attaching it to the budget deal.</p>

<p>But Democrats have already backed away once from a promise to force a vote on DACA. In December, Democrats vowed not to leave town without a DACA fix, but ended up punting the immigration fight to avoid a government shutdown, breaking for the holidays with the futures of an estimated 800,000 young immigrants in limbo. This time, will Democrats be willing to shut down the government over DACA in an election year?</p>

<p>The parties’ approaches appear to be irreconcilable, with Republicans insisting any DACA deal must also include border wall funding — Trump’s asked for $18 billion — which Democrats reject. Democrats are hoping to attach Dreamer protections to a spending bill to fund the government (Republicans can’t pass a spending bill themselves; it requires 60 votes and must pass by January 19 in order to avert a shutdown). Republican leadership, meanwhile, maintains that the DACA deal and the spending bill are on separate tracks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday that it is still his view that a DACA-related immigration bill “will not be a part of any overall spending agreement.”</p>

<p>Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said that he and other lawmakers will come up with “a proposed timeline that will allow us to meet that March 5 deadline” — when DACA is due to end under Trump’s plan, unless Congress restores the protections.</p>

<p>Framing the fight in terms of meeting a deadline fails to capture the reality of nearly 1 million lives hanging in the balance as lawmakers go back and forth. An estimated 120 DACA recipients lose their status each day as their permissions expire, and when DACA ends, that number would jump to about 1,165 a day, according to an analysis by the Arizona Republic.</p>

<p>Congressional negotiations are still all over the map and, at times, incoherent. Even after a lengthy meeting between Trump and a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday, there’s no apparent consensus on which issues are on the table. Trump said he would sign legislation to extend DACA protections, urging Congress to pass a “bill of love,” but not without border wall funding and increased border security. Following the Tuesday meeting, some lawmakers said they agreed on parameters for the immigration deal, narrowing it down to four areas: border security, DACA protections, an end to “chain migration” — a term used to refer to immigration based on family ties — and the diversity visa lottery program. Still, Democrats argue that they are only agreeing to a clean DREAM Act, and the other topics are lumped into “comprehensive immigration reform.”</p>

<p>Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., told reporters Tuesday that the DACA talks get “bigger and bigger” because Republicans “want to take more portions of immigration and immigration issues and bring them into this situation, when we know that all they have to do is fix a very narrow area.”</p>

<p>“We’re not going to allow them to use this as a hostage-taking situation to overhaul immigration policy that has been established in the past 40 years”— Rep. Ruben Gallego</p>

<p>“We can negotiate within that area, but we’re not going to allow them to use this as a hostage-taking situation to overhaul immigration policy that has been established in the past 40 years,” he added.</p>

<p>Dreamers aren’t the only group of immigrants losing protections. The Trump administration on Monday announced it will end the Temporary Protected Status, known as TPS, that has allowed over 262,000 Salvadorans to live and work in the U.S. without fear of deportation for years. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on Monday called the decision “outrageous, cruel,” and “the most vicious thing I’ve ever heard.”</p>

<p>Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he didn’t even know the TPS program existed until recently, adding that Congress shouldn’t just address DACA but “ought to address the whole system.”</p>

<p>“I mean, every day I read your reports,” Kennedy told reporters on Tuesday. “There’s a new program that I didn’t know about. I didn’t know about this new program that allows Central Americans to come into the country. Look, if somebody is about to be harmed in their own country and they need safe harbor, we should help them. But they shouldn’t be able to just park and live here forever. The whole diversity visa lottery system makes absolutely no sense to me. And we keep learning about these programs that, at least, I didn’t know about. We clearly need to sit down and address the system and address the problem in a compassionate but firm way.”</p>

<p>TPS is also ending for immigrants from Haiti, Sudan, and Nicaragua, and the Trump administration will soon decide the future of TPS for five other countries: Syria, Nepal, Honduras, Yemen, and Somalia. But issues like TPS and the visa lottery system, Gallego said, are part of comprehensive immigration reform and should be dealt with after DACA. What is needed now, he said, is “the DREAM Act. Focused. Narrow.”</p>

<p>“Phase one is just fixing the DREAM Act and there may be some negotiations within that, but it’s not going to be some massive tradeoffs,” he said. “They took the hostage, we’re not going to pay for the hostage. We didn’t cause this situation.”</p>

<h2 id="aunbackedpoliceforcecarriedoutamassacreinhaitithekillingshavebeenalmostentirelyignored">A U.N.-Backed Police Force Carried Out a Massacre in Haiti. The Killings Have Been Almost Entirely Ignored.</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Jake Johnston</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-09</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/10/haiti-raid-united-nations-police-grand-ravine/ </p>

<p>At 5 o’clock on the morning of November 13, more than 200 Haitian police officers raided the Grand Ravine area of Port-au-Prince. There was a series of loud explosions, followed by gunfire. For the next six hours, the commotion didn’t stop. The neighborhood was under siege.</p>

<p>What had started as an anti-gang operation in a poor and largely forgotten neighborhood — in a poor and largely forgotten country — ended in the summary execution of innocent civilians on a school campus.</p>

<p>The police officers were working with the United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti. It was launched in October, a reboot of a previous mission that had begun in 2004, when thousands of U.N. troops were sent to Haiti following a coup d’etat, tasked in part with restoring stability and reinforcing national police capacities.</p>

<p>And though the U.N. mission issued a statement days after the raid calling for a prompt investigation by Haitian authorities, it did not publicly acknowledge its own role in the operation. But in late December, a U.N. spokesperson confirmed to The Intercept for the first time that the mission had helped plan the raid, though it distanced itself from the civilian deaths.</p>

<p>“The reported civilian death[s] were not part of the planned operation but of a unilateral action conducted by some [Haitian police] officers after the conclusion of the operation,” the spokesperson, Sophie Boutaud de la Combe, wrote in an email. The raid of the school, according to the U.N. statement, was done without authorization, without alerting the police hierarchy, and outside of the operational plan.</p>

<p>Boutaud de la Combe said that, a day after the raid, the U.N. “conducted an internal enquiry with all the unit commanders who participated in the operation.” The U.N. inquiry, not previously reported, absolved the U.N., finding that U.N. police did not fire their weapons and only “secured the perimeter” of the school, she said.</p>

<p>“None of the [U.N. police] unit proceeded to the location at Maranatha College where the alleged killings took place,” the spokesperson wrote. “The planned portion of the operation went relatively well. The post-operation unilateral initiative of some HNP members to conduct a high risk search, proceeding outside of the operational cadre, without advising the hierarchy, without authorization and contravening the operation plan was not part of the planned operation.”</p>

<p>When I arrived at the Maranatha Evangelical College campus, traveling with a broadcast team from Al Jazeera four days after the raid, it was immediately obvious something heinous had transpired.</p>

<p>The blood that stained the concrete was still wet, unable to dry in the blanket of fog and mist that kept the capital unusually cool that particular week. Water pooled in the courtyard’s clogged drain had turned a dark red, partially obscuring an empty tear gas canister. The smell of the violence still hung in the heavy air.</p>

<p>Classrooms and offices had been ransacked, the contents of closets, drawers, and bookcases spilled across the floors and through the doorways. Light crept in through holes left by bullets that had pierced through the thick concrete. Sometime since the raid, someone had swept another five empty tear gas canisters and close to 100 heavy artillery shells into a pile.</p>

<p>The morning we arrived, faculty and students were meeting to mourn those who had been killed. The school was still closed. They gathered in one of the small classrooms, closed the door to us outsiders, and began to sing. The religious hymns — deep, soulful melodies — echoed throughout the courtyard where they mixed with cries of grieving victims and family members anxious to tell their stories.</p>

<p>“I must kill myself,” Monique Larosse, whose nephew was shot in this courtyard days earlier, told us. “Why did they kill him when they know he was not one of the bad men? He was someone who went to church, studied, and had principles.”</p>

<p>The stories Larosse, along with other survivors and family members, told me make clear something went horribly wrong on that mid-November day. While there’s a lot still unclear, one thing is for certain — the official narrative is at odds with what the people of Grand Ravine say they witnessed and experienced. And they are a far way off from finding justice.</p>

<p>Located near the southern entrance to Haiti’s sprawling capital, Grand Ravine is built on a hillside with picturesque views of the Caribbean Sea. And yet, it’s a downtrodden neighborhood.</p>

<p>Haphazard construction with paltry regulation has left neighborhoods, including Grand Ravine, with little to no infrastructure or government services. Many areas are only accessible by foot.</p>

<p>Narrow, misshapen alleys ascend through the concrete homes secured with rusted sheet metal.</p>

<p>Amid all this is the Maranatha Evangelical College, which has operated here since the 1940s. Despite the name, it offers classes for neighborhood kids beginning in preschool. The campus is a mashup of school buildings, houses and a healthy number of full-size trees, a dissonant image in a city overwhelmed by concrete. A low wall marks it off from the surrounding area.</p>

<p>The only entrance to the elevated campus is a sloping, winding road that sits behind a large metal gate. The campus is a refuge, an oasis of calm in a section of Haiti rife with gang activity.</p>

<p>Grand Ravine is a “red zone,” the label international forces give to the country’s most violence-prone areas. In December 2016, Grand Ravine’s most powerful gang leader, Junior Decimus, was arrested at the airport when he attempted to travel abroad. Soon after, according to a report by local rights organization Justice and Peace, an armed conflict began as others sought to consolidate control of the neighborhood. “Bursts of automatic weapons sang during the day, while police officers from the nearby station watched helplessly,” according to a hard copy of the organization’s report.</p>

<p>In October, the month before the police raid, groups of armed youth set up roadblocks, robbing cars in plain sight as they passed.</p>

<p>The same month, thousands of U.N. soldiers stationed in the country since the 2004 coup d’etat withdrew. Brought to Haiti to restore “stability,” the foreign troops have been involved in multiple deadly raids into neighborhoods similar to Grand Ravine. The international community has spent hundreds of millions training the Haitian police for the U.N.’s eventual departure.</p>

<p>The U.N. Stabilization Mission in Haiti ended its mandate in October, but the U.N. is by no means gone. In place of troops, the U.N. created a smaller successor mission composed of a few thousand police officers. In early November, together with the local police force responsible for the capital, that new U.N. mission helped plan the anti-gang raid into Grand Ravine.</p>

<p>The November 13 raid was one of the first major acts involving the new mission, and the response will define the future of the U.N.’s relationship with the people of Grand Ravine — and the success of the newly empowered local police force.</p>

<p>At 6:30 on that mid-November morning, Armand Louis received a phone call from Maranatha College, the school he has directed for the last 30 years. Something was wrong. The police raid had spilled onto the school’s campus.</p>

<p>When he arrived nearly two hours later, tear gas was already being employed by police, according to an investigation by the National Network of Human Rights Defenders, a local human rights organization known by its French acronym, RNDDH, and confirmed in an interview with Louis. The following account is based on Intercept interviews with multiple witnesses, whose recollections mirror those included in RNDDH’s subsequent report on the massacre.Police opened and searched classrooms, ransacking them in an apparent attempt to locate gang members hiding on campus. They didn’t find any.</p>

<p>There was a brief period of calm. People still on campus gave water to police. The burning in their eyes from the tear gas subsided.</p>

<p>An hour later, Louis said, the school’s guard, Julio Fongene, approached him and said that a number of gang members had threatened him and were hiding in a storage facility on campus. Louis informed the police.</p>

<p>When officers attempted to dislodge the hiding gang members, two police officers were shot. The gang members fled. It does not appear that any were apprehended, as the police have not made public any arrests of those responsible for shooting the officers.</p>

<p>U.N. units composed of police from Jordan and Senegal responded to reports of shots fired and arrived at the school. According to the U.N., they administered first aid to the injured police officers and secured the perimeter.</p>

<p>But on campus grounds, Haitian police proceeded to punish the bystanders caught up in the violence.</p>

<p>First, they shot and killed Fongene, the guard, witnesses said.</p>

<p>Police then accused Louis of setting them up. They dragged him into the central courtyard, where some faculty members and people who live on campus were present. The officers beat him with a chair, causing significant injuries to his head and torso. The Protestant Evangelical Baptist Mission of Haiti, affiliated with the school, included an account of the beating in its statement describing the events, and it was confirmed in an interview with Louis and in the RNDDH report.</p>

<p>Faculty tried to intervene. David Jean Baptiste, a professor, was beaten and then shot five times, including a bullet to the head. The courtyard grounds where he died remained bloodstained for days after.</p>

<p>Vanel Danger lives on the school’s campus and is responsible for the cafeteria. He told The Intercept that an officer put a gun to his head and threatened to pull out his teeth if he didn’t cooperate. Danger dropped to his knees and begged for his life. Danger told the officer he had given him water just an hour earlier, RNDDH reported. Danger was spared. But many more weren’t so lucky.</p>

<p>Louis told The Intercept he was handcuffed by an officer in a U.N. uniform and hauled off, bloody and beaten, to jail.</p>

<p>When the police finally left the campus, around 11 a.m., nine civilians lay dead in the courtyard — five of whom had been shot in the head. Not a single firearm was recovered, suggesting that the killings were “summary executions,” RNDDH reported.</p>

<p>The bodies were not removed until the next afternoon.</p>

<p>Four days after the raid, the alleys that weave around the campus and through the neighborhood’s hilly landscape were largely deserted. Groups of young kids watched us from rooftops. Darting eyes peering from behind small openings in concrete homes followed us throughout the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Very few of them wanted to speak.</p>

<p>“There are many more” victims of this and other shootings, a local resident and student at the school explained. “They are afraid,” added the student, whose name The Intercept is withholding out of concern for their safety.</p>

<p>Though the anti-gang raid ended with a schoolyard massacre, questions linger about what happened outside the campus, where the raid began. At first, the police acknowledged seven civilian deaths — all of which occurred at the school. Overall, the police made 32 arrests, but haven’t acknowledged any deaths outside of the school.</p>

<p>But in its investigation, RNDDH concluded that one of the people found dead on campus had been pulled out of his house in the surrounding neighborhood that morning and brought to the school only after his death.</p>

<p>The total death toll remains unknown.</p>

<p>Doresne Jean, director of the Saint Claire morgue in downtown Port-au-Prince, said that eight bodies had arrived from Grand Ravine on Tuesday, the day after the raid — more than the police originally acknowledged. But Jean said there were surely more.</p>

<p>“Maybe the police moved some bodies,” Jean said, “because we had five or six people come here to ask if we had their relatives.” They were not on the list of bodies already received.</p>

<p>Justice and Peace, the local human rights organization that has been monitoring violence in neighborhoods such as Grand Ravine, was one of the first to investigate the massacre. Rovelsond Apollon, an observer there, said his organization had confirmed 12 dead, but that the real total would likely never be known.</p>

<p>Not that many people, even in Haiti, are paying attention to what happens in Grand Ravine. “A hundred or even 200 could die there and nobody would know,” Apollon said.</p>

<p>Four days after the raid, a single shoe sits in the middle of the soccer field behind Maranatha College in Port-au-Prince, on Nov. 17, 2017.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how I am going to live without my son,” Gina Napolean told us from the school’s courtyard, the grief visible on her face just four days after the massacre. Her only son, 22-year-old Kens Napoleon, had been the family’s breadwinner. He was killed by a shot to the head. She put the blame squarely on the government, who she accused of “sending the police to kill our children.”</p>

<p>It’s not just that politicians exert control over the police, Apollon said — they are involved with the gangs themselves. His organization has interviewed young people with heavy weaponry that is not easy to acquire, he explained, and they said the weapons had been provided by politicians. “Politicians and authorities are not innocent in what happened, because they, too, play their part in the violence,” he said. The politicians, for their part, have not publicly addressed these accusations.</p>

<p>But since the raid, nearly every government official or institution has avoided taking responsibility.</p>

<p>Asked about the raid, the police chief simply said it was planned by the local captain and the new U.N. mission. Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant told the press that the specifics of field operations were outside his purview. Both blamed poor planning for the bloodshed.</p>

<p>The operation was compromised from the beginning. Police officers told local human rights investigators that confidential information about the operation was circulating even before it took place.</p>

<p>A former Haitian military official later told me that he found out about the raid when he heard it being discussed on an open radio channel on November 12, the day before it was launched. A gang leader later called in to a local radio show, alleging that a rival gang from a different neighborhood had participated with police in the raid itself. Others have suggested the raid was an attempt to recover a cache of guns that authorities had distributed in the neighborhood weeks earlier. And so the rumor mill in Haiti churns.</p>

<p>The U.N.’s statement — that its officers were stationed only at the perimeter of the school — contradicts the statements made by Louis, who told me he was handcuffed by a U.N. agent on campus. The U.N. insists that it was uninvolved because its officers were not in the courtyard, but the entrance where they say they were stationed is set just below the scene of the massacre.</p>

<p>The new U.N. mission is ostensibly focused on justice, but Apollon noted that Haiti has seen many international missions throughout its history. “They all failed,” he said, because they do not understand the Haitian reality.</p>

<p>In Haiti, he said, impunity reigns.</p>

<p>Nearly two months after the massacre, no one has been publicly held responsible. The police inspector general has completed an investigation and passed it on to a judge, who could order the arrest or dismissal of officers involved. One police officer accused of involvement is already missing, according to the inspector general. Families of nine victims, including those of the two police officers, received a one-time payment of about $1,500 for funeral expenses. But none of the intellectual authors of the botched raid appear to have been identified or questioned.</p>

<p>Instead, it was Louis, the school’s director, who was arrested for complicity in the death of the two police officers. After being publicly beaten with a chair at the school he had overseen for 30 years, Louis was held in a Port-au-Prince jail for more than a week.</p>

<p>Under pressure from religious organizations and the school’s faculty, Louis was eventually released for health reasons. But he still has not returned to the school.</p>

<p>“In a country like mine,” Louis wrote to me weeks later, “it is hard to take our leaders at their word.” That, he continued, was “why we need to know what the real motive [of the raid] was.” The public authorities have not yet interviewed him. Do “they really want everything to be investigated properly?” he said, “or was this all planned?”</p>

<p>Apollon said continued raids would do little to address the fundamental problems afflicting neighborhoods such as Grand Ravine. Rather, violence stems from the total absence of the state in such areas, and it will continue so long as the population’s needs are not met. What residents need, he said, “is education.”</p>

<p>After the raid, the school was closed for two weeks.</p>

<p>“We need school,” a student at Maranatha told me that day in the courtyard. “Without education, what hope do we have?”</p>

<h2 id="welcometolawenforcementsdarksidesecretevidenceillegalsearchesanddubioustrafficstops">Welcome to Law Enforcement’s “Dark Side”: Secret Evidence, Illegal Searches, and Dubious Traffic Stops</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Trevor Aaronson</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-08</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/09/dark-side-fbi-dea-illegal-searches-secret-evidence/ </p>

<p>Federal agents at the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration speak in veiled terms about the secret DEA unit that shares intelligence from the National Security Agency and other organizations with law enforcement for use in criminal investigations. They call it the “Dark Side.”</p>

<p>The Special Operations Division receives raw intelligence from the NSA’s surveillance programs, including from the mass surveillance programs revealed in documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden. DEA agents in this unit then analyze the surveillance data and disseminate leads to federal and local police nationwide. But the information comes with a catch. Law enforcement can’t use it to secure search warrants or in any way reveal the intelligence community as the source of their leads. Instead, they must find another way to justify their searches and broader investigations.</p>

<p>An egregious example of this law enforcement tactic occurred in 2004 when, through intercepted phone calls and their own subsequent surveillance, the DEA discovered that Ascension Alverez-Tejeda was transporting drugs from Los Angeles to Washington state in his car. To search the vehicle without revealing the phone calls as their original source, DEA agents set up an elaborate ruse.</p>

<p>Alverez-Tejeda and his girlfriend were stopped at a traffic light. As the light turned green, the car in front of them started to move and then stopped quickly. Alverez-Tejeda braked in time, but a truck rear-ended him. As Alverez-Tejeda inspected the damage, police arrived and arrested the truck driver for drunken driving. Officers instructed Alverez-Tejeda and his girlfriend to drive their car to a parking lot, leave the keys in the car, and sit in the police cruiser for processing. Just then, a car thief jumped into Alverez-Tejeda’s car and drove off. Police recovered the car, obtained a search warrant, and found cocaine and methamphetamine.</p>

<p>Other than Alverez-Tejeda and his girlfriend, every person involved in this piece of theater was a DEA agent or local police officer: the person driving the car in front of Alverez-Tejeda’s, the “drunk” truck driver, even the supposed car thief. While a federal judge ruled that the DEA hoax violated Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable search and seizure, an appeals court overturned the ruling and described this abuse of Alverez-Tejeda’s constitutional rights as “relatively mild.”</p>

<p>The convoluted and secretive process of building a case to obscure the use of underlying intelligence, known as “parallel construction,” is meant to protect the intelligence community’s sources and methods, according to internal DEA documents. It also often deprives the accused of a fair shot at defending themselves in court because some of the evidence against them is not made public.</p>

<p>“The federal government is deliberately concealing methods used by intelligence or law enforcement agencies to identify or investigate suspects — including methods that may be illegal.”</p>

<p>The DEA’s Special Operations Division is one of several tools the government uses to hide the origins of criminal investigations nationwide, in potential violation of constitutional protections. In a report released today, “Dark Side: Secret Origins of Evidence in U.S. Criminal Cases,” Human Rights Watch documents the use of parallel construction by federal and local police agencies, finding the practice is used in the United States “frequently and possibly even daily.”</p>

<p>“A growing body of evidence suggests that the federal government is deliberately concealing methods used by intelligence or law enforcement agencies to identify or investigate suspects — including methods that may be illegal,” the report states. “It does so by creating a different story about how agents discovered the information, and as a result, people may be imprisoned without ever knowing enough to challenge the potentially rights-violating origins of the cases against them.”</p>

<p>Among Human Rights Watch’s findings:</p>

<pre><code>•   Traffic stops and vehicle searches are commonly used as the pretext for investigations in order to protect the true source.

•   Government agents use parallel construction to conceal both high-tech methods, such as the NSA’s surveillance programs, as well as crude ones, such as illegal searches of vehicles and bags.

•   Prosecutors assist law enforcement agents in concealing the origin of investigations by telling judges and defense lawyers that they are not required to find out if certain agencies, including the NSA, were involved in the case.

<p>As Human Rights Watch has documented, parallel construction, and the internal government debate about its efficacy and legality, extend back at least to the mid-1970s. A panel of intelligence officials in 1976 lamented that if prosecutors disclosed the use of intelligence information to defendants and judges, secret surveillance “methods could be publicly revealed.” A 1983 CIA document suggested that drug agencies use intelligence information to power their investigations but that they protect that information by building “a firebreak in the evidentiary [trail] leading to sources and methods.”</p>

<p>Indeed, the pioneers of parallel construction appear to be drug agents. Not all federal law enforcement agencies were on board at first. The FBI was skeptical that the methods the DEA used were legal, Michael Horn, the first special agent-in-charge of the DEA’s Special Operations Division, said during a 2015 DEA panel. “When [the FBI] started seeing some success, they … kind of changed their mind,” Horn said.</p>

<p>In a sophisticated form, parallel construction may involve the use of information from the NSA’s mass surveillance programs that is then re-obtained through the less controversial powers granted by the 1976 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. When prosecutors present the information in court, they source it to traditional FISA, rather than the more controversial mass surveillance program. The Intercept reported in November 2017 that this occurred in the case of Fazliddin Kurbanov, who was convicted in Idaho on terrorism-related charges. Although classified NSA documents revealed that Kurbanov’s communications had been intercepted through PRISM, a warrantless mass surveillance program, the Justice Department claimed in court that he had only been subjected to warrant-based surveillance under traditional FISA powers.</p>

<p>In its cruder and likely more common form, parallel construction may involve information from mass surveillance, a highly sensitive informant, or an illegal search that is then disguised. In a case Human Rights Watch discovered, security video at a New Mexico bus station showed a DEA agent illegally searching luggage left on a Greyhound bus during a layover. When passengers returned, the DEA agent asked for consent to search a passenger’s bag, already knowing that it contained methamphetamine.</p>

<p>“Under human rights law, everybody has the right to a fair trial,” said Human Right Watch investigator Sarah St. Vincent. “And that means what it says, so when you have the government deliberately concealing investigative actions that may have been illegal, defendants have no way of knowing their rights have been violated.”</p>

<p>Even DEA employees seem to know something untoward is afoot in the Special Operations Division, the unit that passes intelligence to law enforcement. As Arthur Rizer, a former federal prosecutor who worked in the unit, told St. Vincent: “When we all left, we got little keychains of Darth Vader.”</p>

<h2 id="republicanscirculateflyeraboutisiswhilerushingopaquesurveillancebill">Republicans Circulate Flyer About ISIS While Rushing Opaque Surveillance Bill</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alex Emmons</p>

<p>While Congress is still reeling from a last-minute push to pass the GOP tax bill, House Republicans tried to ram through a bill that would reauthorize major surveillance programs, with language that may have actually expanded what the National Security Agency and FBI are allowed to do.</p>

<p>A last-minute amendment Tuesday night left privacy activists scrambling to understand the details of the bill, fearing a possible vote as early as Thursday morning. The Rules Committee later announced that it would postpone its meeting on the bill — meaning that it wouldn’t imminently come to vote — but leadership could still try to force it through by attaching it to a budget resolution.</p>

<p>Trying to drum up support for the bill, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes, R-Calif., circulated a two-page flyer with enlarged images of Islamic State fighters and Haji Iman, ISIS’s former finance minister who was killed by U.S. forces in 2016.</p>

<p>“VOTE YES ON H.R. 4478,” the flyer reads. “HAJI IMAN would still be plotting to kill Americans without Section 702.” On the second page, the flyer goes on to say that 702 surveillance over a two-year period helped locate Iman.</p>

<p>The flyer was signed “HPSCI majority,” with public contact information for the committee office.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Nunes confirmed that Republican committee staff had sent around the letter, and said it was an updated version of an earlier document posted to the committee’s website.</p>

<p>The bill would reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is set to expire at the end of the year. The law was originally passed to legalize the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping under the Bush administration and serves as the basis for some of the NSA’s largest surveillance programs. Privacy activists have raised concerns about the massive amounts of Americans’ data swept up under the legal authority, and how law enforcement agencies can sift through much of it without a warrant.</p>

<p>Democrats and Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee spent much of the year working out a compromise reauthorization bill, which codified certain limits on 702 collection but stopped short of requiring a warrant to query the data for information on Americans. But the House Intelligence Committee passed its own version of the bill, which does not include those limits and may actually expand the NSA’s authorities.</p>

<p>Without explanation, the Intelligence Committee’s bill appeared on the Rules Committee website Tuesday night, along with a last-minute amendment from Nunes.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty and National Security Program, told The Intercept over email that the flyer is a scare tactic and ignores the heart of the debate.</p>

<p>“This is a total straw man. No one in Congress believes that Section 702 should be allowed to expire. The question is whether it should be reformed to prevent domestic spying on Americans,” said Goitein. “Congress should instead be voting on one of the actual reform proposals, not one of which would prevent surveillance of someone like Haji Iman.”</p>

<h2 id="canthesupremecourtcontinuetolivewithourarbitraryandcapriciousdeathpenalty">Can the Supreme Court Continue to Live with Our Arbitrary and Capricious Death Penalty?</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Liliana Segura</p>

<p id="date">date: 2017-12-23</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2017/12/24/arizona-death-penalty-supreme-court/ </p>

<p>Rudolph J. Gerber has never forgotten where he was when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty over 45 years ago. He was a new lawyer in Phoenix, working as the associate director of the Arizona Criminal Code Commission. The landmark 1972 ruling in Furman v. Georgia invalidated death sentences across the country, including those of 16 people on Arizona’s death row. Outraged politicians vowed to bring back capital punishment; one Phoenix Republican declared his candidacy for Maricopa County attorney that very day.</p>

<p>The next day, Republican State Sen. Sandra Day O’Connor, a member of Arizona’s Senate Judiciary Committee, came to Gerber’s office. She dropped the Furman decision on his desk. “I said, ‘What do you think we should do about it?’” Gerber recalled in a recent phone interview. “And her exact words were, ‘Rudy, I want you to write a death penalty we can live with.’”</p>

<p>To O’Connor – and to the 5-4 majority in Furman – this meant revamping Arizona law to ensure the death penalty was more carefully applied. Gerber was up to the task, although he did not have strong feelings on the matter himself. No one had been executed in Arizona in nearly 10 years. “I thought, well, having a new death penalty law is like having a new tax code,” he said. He began to study the ruling.</p>

<p>It was an unusual decision. Each of the nine justices had written a separate opinion in Furman. But the prevailing problem was arbitrariness – there was no uniformity in death sentences across the country, nor in the severity of the crimes that sent people to death row. Race and social status were the real drivers of death sentences, making the punishment discriminatory and “freakishly imposed.” Justice Potter Stewart called the death penalty cruel and unusual “in the same way that being struck by lighting is cruel and unusual.”</p>

<p>Gerber began drafting some standards to define the subset of murders that could be considered most heinous and deserving of death. Consulting the Model Penal Code, he identified six statutory aggravating factors — for example, killing a police officer, murdering for monetary gain, or having previously been convicted of a violent crime.</p>

<p>O’Connor had told the press that the future of capital punishment should be up to Arizona voters, who widely supported it. Yet most seemed indifferent to the details. Public hearings on the law were poorly attended, according to one Arizona Republic columnist, who described “the rooms half empty, the public apparently unconcerned.” As the law went into effect in 1974, O’Connor successfully ran for a seat on the Maricopa County Superior Court, and was later appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the first woman to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Gerber had gone to work as a prosecutor in Maricopa County when the high court handed down its next major ruling on capital punishment in 1976. Gregg v. Georgia upheld Georgia’s new death penalty law, a green light to resume executions. To Gerber, the issue was no longer an abstraction. Prosecutors in Arizona had swiftly availed themselves of the law he helped design, without waiting on the court. By the time Gregg came down, they had already sent a dozen people to death row.</p>

<p>In 1977, Gerber himself sought the death penalty against a man named Joe Clarence Smith, who had brutally murdered a young waitress, stabbing her genitals and stuffing her mouth with dirt. Yet when the time came for the sentencing phase, Gerber found himself conflicted. “Even though I had convicted him and he was a terrible human being, I didn’t think I wanted to see him executed,” he said. A colleague took over and won a death sentence.</p>

<p>More than 40 years later, Smith has yet to be executed. If Gerber could not have foreseen such a thing in the late ’70s, he soon saw plenty of other problems. “As a draftsman, prosecutor, and then trial judge, watching ‘my’ death penalty statute in action, I came to realize how little I comprehended the nuances and data regarding the day-to-day workings of capital punishment,” he wrote years later in the Stanford Law and Policy Review. Among his central concerns was the immense power granted to prosecutors, who weaponized the death penalty in everything from plea bargains to political campaigns. As time passed, he wrote, “I marveled at the enthusiasm of colleagues and politicians in touting a practice they did not seem to understand.”</p>

<p>Gerber watched with dismay as the tough-on-crime era took hold in Arizona. As politicians campaigned on harsh sentencing, they introduced bill after bill adding new aggravators to make people eligible for the death penalty. The once-narrow list of aggravating factors “crept and expanded to absurd, broad categories,” Gerber said, such as “heinous” and “depraved,” and perhaps most bizarre, “without legal justification.”</p>

<p>Today, there are 14 aggravating factors that can send a defendant to death in Arizona. Ironically, the very mechanism that was supposed to fix the death penalty “has put us right back into the arbitrariness and caprice that was condemned in Furman,” Gerber said. “We have come full circle, even with good intentions.”</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Gerber, now 79 years old and retired from the Arizona Court of Appeals, joined 20 former judges, prosecutors, and other members of the state’s legal community to sign an amicus brief to a petition pending before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case, Hidalgo v. Arizona, challenges Arizona’s death penalty law for being overly broad, in violation of the Constitution. Filed on behalf of Abel Daniel Hidalgo — and brought by former Obama Solicitor General Neal Katyal — the petition does not stop there. It argues that the time has come to abolish capital punishment altogether. “The death penalty is unconstitutional,” Hidalgo argues, “full stop.”</p>

<p>Hidalgo has been closely watched for months. It is the latest attempt to rise to a challenge put forth in 2015 by Justice Stephen Breyer in his impassioned dissent in Glossip v. Gross. Breyer famously laid out the myriad problems with death penalty — from the decades prisoners spend in isolation to the risk of executing the innocent — and called for “a full briefing” on the constitutionality of capital punishment. Katyal argues that Hidalgo is the ideal vehicle, describing Arizona as a microcosm of the flaws Breyer described and “an exemplar of the arbitrariness in the imposition of the death penalty in the United States.”</p>

<p>While the chances of success for any petition before the court are slim, some express cautious optimism that it might take at least the first question. “Arizona has reached a point that is pretty clearly in violation of Gregg v. Georgia,” Gerber said. The ruling was premised on the notion that the death penalty should be narrowly applied in the most egregious cases. Yet Hidalgo includes data showing that 99 percent of murders over an 11-year period in Maricopa County included at least one aggravator. “When virtually all first-degree murders are eligible for death, the ‘worst of the worst’ requirement turns on its head,” Gerber wrote in November. Even the Maricopa Superior Court judge who most recently upheld Arizona’s law found this data disconcerting, calling it “problematic from a constitutional standpoint.”</p>

<p>Hidalgo has been repeatedly listed and re-listed for conference by the court, most recently appearing on its December 8 calendar. But it was delayed again after the justices requested the full record from the state — a sign someone wants to take a closer look. As 2017 comes to a close, the fate of Hidalgo will wait until the new year.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the death penalty continues its precipitous decline. In its end-of-year report for 2017, which tracks the ever-dwindling executions and death sentences, the Death Penalty Information Center identified three “outlier” counties responsible for a disproportionate percentage of all new death sentences. Maricopa County was one of them. There, prosecutors handed down their latest death sentence just last month, in the case of 29-year-old John Allen, convicted of murder and child abuse. His wife, Sammantha, was sentenced to die for the same crime just a few months earlier, becoming the third woman on Arizona’s death row.</p>

<p>The once-narrow list of aggravating factors “crept and expanded to absurd, broad categories.”</p>

<p>The enduring zeal for the death penalty in Maricopa County is partly the legacy of one man: Andrew Thomas, elected county attorney in 2004. In his first two years, death penalty prosecutions nearly doubled in Maricopa County. In one of many articles about Thomas, the Phoenix New Times described “one fairly typical case from that era,” in which Maricopa County prosecutors sought death against a man for killing someone while drunken driving – “only the second time in the nation’s history that’s happened.”</p>

<p>“He overused the death penalty,” Gerber recalled. What’s more, Thomas found an ally in his campaign: notorious Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had campaigned alongside him. Gerber is blunt in saying the two men shared a racist bias against Latinos, who receive death sentences in disproportionate numbers in Arizona. When a crime was committed by a Latino, “for Andrew Thomas, one of the first responses was well, let’s fry ’em. Let’s put ’em to death.”</p>

<p>The effect was partly captured by Arizona Attorney Magazine, which ran a two-part series in 2009 titled “The Capital Case Crisis In Maricopa County: What (Little) We Can Do About It.” The authors had planned to call for an empirical study of the cost of capital cases, only to realize that the situation was too dire; it was clear that there was an alarming backlog of capital cases in the county. There were not enough qualified judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and other specialists available to handle them.</p>

<p>Thomas was ultimately disbarred by the Arizona Supreme Court, which found he “outrageously exploited power, flagrantly fostered fear, and disgracefully misused the law.” He was expelled in 2012. Today, Maricopa County still stands apart, but prosecutors have wielded their power similarly at different times throughout the state. In Pinal County, which is home to Arizona’s death row, the election of far-right County Attorney Lando Voyles in 2012 brought an unprecedented surge in capital prosecutions. Voyles, who was from Maricopa County, “embarked on a crusade to basically try to get everybody the death penalty that had committed a first-degree murder,” recalls James Mannato, a veteran attorney in Florence, Arizona, and currently the county’s public defender. Within a few years, death penalty cases had tripled in Pinal County. “It serves to highlight the issue that’s now being presented in Hidalgo’s petition,” Mannato said.</p>

<p>To Mannato, the problem comes down to power. “It’s hard, really, for people sometimes to resist the urge to seek death penalty because it’s simply so easy to do it, and it gives any prosecutor the ultimate amount of leverage,” he said. Regardless, voters did not seem to have much patience for Voyles, who lost re-election in 2016 amid accusations of overreach and overspending, including on capital prosecutions, which cost half a million dollars each.</p>

<p>Mannato was optimistic about Hidalgo’s chances before the Supreme Court. “I think they’re going to take it,” he said, “and I think the reason is because the momentum’s been building across the country against the death penalty.” State legislators continue to pass abolition legislation, governors keep imposing moratoriums, and fewer and fewer juries are sentencing people to death. “They’ve done what they think is morally correct without waiting for the Supreme Court to tell them.”</p>

<p>Today, Rudy Gerber is retired and living is California, where attempts to end the death penalty by ballot initiative have repeatedly failed. The state is home to Riverside County — another death penalty outlier — as well as the country’s largest death row. The story of how it got this way has parallels to Arizona: a widening net of factors made defendants eligible for the death penalty. “They don’t call them aggravators, they call them special circumstances here,” he said. “But the result is exactly the same. Upwards of 90 percent of California murderers fall into one or more of the special circumstances.” It is another reason Hidalgo should interest the Supreme Court. “A number of states, not just Arizona, are in the same place.”</p>

<p>In California, the issue dates back to 1978, when a lawyer named Don Heller drafted a pro-death penalty ballot initiative that would pass overwhelmingly, expanding the use of special circumstances in capital cases. Like Gerber, Heller soon began questioning what he’d done. A wave of California prosecutors immediately sought death sentences. “Everyone was trying to put a notch on their gun. There were a tremendous number of capital cases filed,” he told me in 2016. The state’s death penalty population surged — today it hovers at 750. Yet only 13 executions have been carried out since then. The fight over lethal injection has kept the state mired in costly litigation.</p>

<p>In Arizona, executions have been on hold since the botched killing of Joseph Wood, a harrowing, two-hour ordeal that made headlines across the world. Similar episodes have occurred across death penalty states. In Ohio this year, the state failed to kill 69-year-old Alva Campbell — the second time in less than a decade a man has left the state’s death chamber alive.</p>

<p>Other botched executions are discussed in a 2007 book co-authored by Gerber, which also shows how, even when all appears to have gone smoothly, people who attend or carry out executions are forever altered. One Arizona woman featured in the book — a former lower court judge named Donna Leone Hamm — describes a sick feeling of complicity, even as a death penalty opponent. “You stood and watched a man die,” she said. “You did nothing to stop it. You could not have stopped it, but you didn’t even try.”</p>

<p>Hamm’s husband was incarcerated on drug charges in Arizona during the 1980s. When she began coming to see him in prison in those years, she told me, “I realized they treated me very, very differently when I was touring the prisons as a judge then they did when I became a visitor.” When her husband was released, they started an advocacy group called Middle Ground Prison Reform. It was around this time, in 1992, that Arizona finally carried out its first post-Gregg execution, with Hamm as a witness. It was a major media event. She remembers seeing flowers planted alongside the death house and “velvet ropes” upon entering the viewing room, as if “you’re in line to go see a movie.”</p>

<p>“It was disgusting,” she said. The man, Donald Harding, died in the gas chamber, wearing nothing but an adult diaper. Witnesses commented on his pasty white skin; Hamm became convinced it was primarily for humiliation. Harding stuck up his middle finger as the execution began, which “everybody talked about and wrote about.” Today, Hamm is unsure about Hidalgo’s chances at the Supreme Court. But she does not believe Arizona will end the death penalty on its own.</p>

<p>In November, as the Supreme Court continued to mull over different cases, the Huffington Post ran an article by Ray Krone, sentenced to die in Maricopa County on the basis of junk forensic evidence. In 2002, Krone became the 100th person exonerated from death row in the U.S. “I wish I could say my story is unusual,” he wrote. “But the truth is, 160 men and women have been exonerated and freed from death row since 1973.” He called on the Supreme Court to take up Hidalgo and abolish the death penalty for good.</p>

<p>More than perhaps any other issue, a growing awareness of wrongful convictions has likely helped shift public opinion favoring the death penalty to its current historic lows. In Arizona, Hidalgo points out, nine people have been exonerated from death row. (And cases like that of Barry Jones, convicted in 1995, show there is good reason to believe there are other innocent people facing execution in the state.) After the 2015 exoneration of Debra Milke, the Arizona Republic ran a series on capital punishment. As Gerber recalls, the stories generated a great deal of debate, even among “back-row conservatives.” Recent exonerations in Arizona have forced people in Maricopa County to confront the reality that innocent people are sentenced to die — “and that maybe it’s time to just get rid of it.”</p>

<p>This shift in mindset includes Sandra Day O’Connor herself. After 25 years on the Supreme Court bench, often providing a swing vote in death penalty cases, she retired in 2006. One day toward the end of her term, in 2001, she gave a speech before the Minnesota Women Lawyers. It made headlines. “If statistics are any indication,” O’Connor said, “the system may well be allowing some innocent defendants to be executed.”</p>

<p>When Gerber heard of her comments, he was surprised. When he knew her all those years ago in Phoenix, she “would have never said that,” he said. “So something happened in her tenure on the Supreme Court. Maybe studying these capital cases that opened her mind to the possibility that maybe some innocent people have been executed,” he said. “But I cannot speak for her, then or now.”</p>

<p>Whether O’Connor would vote to take Hidalgo if she were still on the bench is impossible to know. But her feelings on capital punishment certainly appear to have evolved. Speaking to her audience members in Minnesota, she noted that their state did not have the death penalty. “You must breathe a big sigh of relief every day.”</p>

<p>For the third year in a row, police officers in the United States have killed more than 1,000 people.</p>

<p>How do we make sense of such a staggering number?</p>

<p>This week, the research collective Mapping Police Violence, led by Sam Sinyangwe, released the 2017 Police Violence Report — an analysis of data concerning every deadly run-in with law enforcement recorded this year.</p>

<p>“Compiling information from media reports, obituaries, public records, and databases like Fatal Encounters and the Washington Post,” the website reads, “this report represents the most comprehensive accounting of deadly police violence in 2017.” Whereas 2016 saw 1,093 people killed by the police, that number has risen to more than 1,100 today.</p>

<p>They allow readers to download their data. As in previous years (see the 2015 and 2016 versions of this project), I spent some time looking at the locations of these encounters. What might we see in the landscape?</p>

<p>Using the Street View API, I wrote a computer script that runs each address through the all-seeing eye of Google, downloading three images for each location.</p>

<p>What emerges is a triptych of police brutality in 2017. Every frame you see is from one of these sites of violence.</p>

<h2 id="welostalotin2017hereswherewecanandcantlookforprogressin2018">We Lost a Lot in 2017. Here’s Where We Can — and Can’t — Look for Progress in 2018.</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Shaun King</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-01</p>

<p id="link">url: https://theintercept.com/2018/01/01/2018-progress-erica-garner-midterms-progress/ </p>

<p>Have you ever been in a fight before? I mean a real fist fight. Not a martial arts match, but the kind of fight where you rarely get a chance to strike a Bruce Lee pose or make a Bruce Lee noise. We’re not talking made-for-TV. Real-life fights are a mess, and after you’ve been in one, you’ll approach every other fight from that point forward very differently.</p>

<p>For many of us, 2017 was a fist fight. Like many fist fights, I’m not even sure if we won or lost; I suspect we lost. I know we’re battered and bruised. We landed a good punch here or there and I know we’re still standing, but if this is a win, I’d hate to see what losing feels like.</p>

<p>More people were killed by police this year than last year, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Justice Department are doing everything they can to avoid holding police accountable. Muslims and immigrants and indigenous Americans have been railroaded over and over again. People are starving to death in Yemen. Africans are being bought, sold, and murdered in Libya. Rich people just got huge tax cuts, while most Americans can’t afford health care or college tuition. And politicians who claim to be progressive still seem like they’re embarrassed to actually act like it.</p>

<p>Then there are the more concrete losses, and we lost a lot.</p>

<p>The sudden heart attack, coma, and death of 27-year-old Erica Garner, a mother and anti-police brutality activist, somehow made sense as we closed 2017. Her death was a horrible cap to an unimaginably hard year. Erica was my friend. I trusted her. She was as honest and authentic of a person as you’ll ever encounter on this earth. She spoke of truth to power as a daily discipline and refused to suffer fools gladly. It’s in the shadows of her untimely death that I look forward into 2018, trying to imagine what’s ahead.</p>

<p>It might be better to start with what is not going to happen in 2018.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is not going to be impeached. Period. First and foremost, no matter what Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation finds, Republicans will continue to control Congress at least until January 2019. Between now and then, even if Democrats have landslide victories in the midterm elections, the current Republicans in Congress will not impeach Trump. They are in too deep with him; they’ve hitched their wagons to his legacy and leadership. Even if the Mueller investigation charges someone in Trump’s inner circle with obstruction of justice or some crime related to collusion with an foreign government, Trump would never resign under any circumstances. All of this to say that 2018 will be another year with Trump in office, and expecting otherwise is futile.</p>

<p>After you get your ass handed to you, you can either go back with the same game plan and keep losing, or you can rethink everything, regroup, and go back to the fight.</p>

<p>Yet there is room for some victories, and here’s what I do expect to happen in 2018:</p>

<p>2018 is going to be a year of successful organizing. After you get your ass handed to you, you can either go back with the same game plan and keep losing, or you can rethink everything, regroup, and go back to the fight with a better chance of success. That’s one lesson we need to take from Erica: organize, organize, organize. There’s no substitute for making it happen by showing up and being there and doing the work, especially in the face of adversity.</p>

<p>If we do all that, 2018 will be the year of better plans, better actions. A lot of losses accumulated on the criminal justice reform front in 2017, but every win — ranging from essential juvenile justice breakthroughs to more widespread legalization and decriminalization of marijuana — was hard-fought and well-organized. A few reform-minded district attorneys were elected in 2017, and with the skills and understanding gained from those elections, hundreds of additional district attorney races that have been historically ignored will now be in play in 2018 and beyond.</p>

<p>On Monday, January 1, recreational marijuana becomes legal in California. This breakthrough cannot be understated. The impact this will have on California’s justice system and economy is massive. California is a pace car for much of the U.S. As other states see the benefits, 2018 will be the year when a record number of cities and states begin to follow suit, either by enacting reforms or putting in place the mechanisms to consider it. (Speaking of California, the state will also make meaningful progress on extending universal health care.)</p>

<p>Legalizing pot will mean that, in 2018, we will see a growing movement to expunge the criminal records of those convicted of marijuana-related crimes in California and beyond. We will also see breakthroughs on the restoration of voting rights for formerly incarcerated people all over the country.</p>

<p>Lastly, we are going to see record-setting voter turnout all over the country in 2018 for important midterm elections. It will rival or top that of previous presidential elections. That trend will continue in 2019 and 2020, and will indeed lead Democrats and progressives to begin regaining power.</p>

<p>There’s work to do; none of it will come easy. But if we make the effort, we can expect this and more. We can find our way to progress.</p>
