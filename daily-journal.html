<p id="byline">by: William Moore</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-14</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/news/tpd-makes-effort-to-maintain-its-diversity/article_e51e5b29-910d-537c-a62a-2290f4172f52.html </p>

<p>TUPELO – Over the past seven years, the number of minority and female officers in the Tupelo Police Department has declined. And that is with a concerted effort by the department to hire more in both demographics.</p>

<p>“TPD works hand in hand with the city human resources department to find the best available candidates to become police officers,” said Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre. “A key component of that effort is the intentional recruiting of applicants from Historically Black Colleges.</p>

<p>“We strive to have an efficient and transparent hiring process. We also recognize that competition for qualified applicants is intense in law enforcement.”</p>

<p>In 2011, females made up 12.6 percent of the 111 full-time certified officers in the department. Females account for 9.5 percent of the 105-person force today. During the same timeframe, the percentage of black officers dropped from 15.3 percent to 13.3 percent. The number of Hispanic officers remained about the same, around 2 percent.</p>

<p>When compared with the demographic makeup of the city as a whole, the department’s numbers are askew. Women make up 53 percent of Tupelo’s population, according to the latest census data. The same 2010 survey showed the city was about 37 percent black and 3.5 percent Hispanic.</p>

<p>“We rank the candidates and usually take the Top 10 and bring them in for interviews,” Aguirre said. “If there are any women (or minorities) in that pool, we will consider them.”</p>

<p>The department could address the issue this year by hiring more black and female officers. According to TPD spokesman Capt. Chuck McDougald, the department is slotted for 114 certified officers. Because of the danger and stress of the job, turnover can be high.</p>

<p>“Hiring and retention rates are a challenge that all agencies are facing,” Aguirre said. “In the end we want the best candidates for our citizens and a police force that is representative of the citizens we serve.”</p>

<p>While the number of minorities and females are low, they fill some key supervisory roles. Aguirre is one of two Hispanic officers. Maj. Anthony Hill is the highest ranking black officer overseeing the departments special operations. He is joined by Sgt. James King and Robert Harper, who was promoted to sergeant earlier this year.</p>

<p>Among females, Lt. Lynette Sandlin is second in command over the detectives division. The department’s only two black females both have ranks. Lt. Katarsha White is the community oriented policing coordinator. Sgt. Tiffany Gilleylen helps oversee a patrol shift. The lone Hispanic female is Sgt. Chamila Brown.</p>

<p>In recent years, TPD has maintained two black detectives. That ended with the sudden death of Steven Wade in late March. In addition to being a crime scene expert, Wade handled the bulk of the city’s juvenile cases. Those cases have been shifted to the other black detective, L’Brien Miller.</p>

<p>“He is doing a great job,” Aguirre said. “He is active in his church and has a good rapport with youth.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to be able to get on their level and be able to talk their language. We are really happy to have him take over.”</p>

<p>Officials are still looking to fill the open detective slot. There is currently one black detective and one female detective (Sandlin). In order to be a detective, the officer must have at least five years in law enforcement – at least three of those with TPD – and no write-ups on their record.</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/news/remembering-their-service-and-sacrifice/article_a3a0f412-b2db-5380-8cad-7518822d97da.html </p>

<p>TUPELO – Law enforcement from across the region paused Wednesday evening to remember their brothers in blue who are no longer here.</p>

<p>The 19th annual Northeast Mississippi Law Enforcement Memorial service remembered the more than two dozen officers who have died in the line of duty since 1939.</p>

<p>“These men were fathers, sons, brothers and friends,” said Tupelo councilman Buddy Palmer. “They were also true heroes, and I feel it is fitting that we memorialize them.”</p>

<p>Debbie Brangenberg, whose son, Tupelo officer Gale Stauffer, was killed responding to a bank robbery in December 2013, was the speaker and told the crowd about Concerns of Police Survivors (COPS), a support group that has been a life line for them.</p>

<p>“Our family’s lives changed forever the day Gale was killed,” Brangenberg said. “We didn’t know about COPS until the Louisiana chapter reached out to Gale’s father.”</p>

<p>More than just a support group, COPS offers youth camps and retreats for siblings, parents, children and coworkers of fallen officers.</p>

<p>“Their hands-on programs are the best. Their counselors are wonderful because most of them have connections to law enforcement, so they get it,” Brangenberg said.</p>

<p>“Making the decision to attend the parents retreat was the hardest thing for me, but it was the best decision I have made. It’s become my mission now to get more members of law enforcement to participate.”</p>

<p>During the candlelight ceremony, the names of the fallen officers were read aloud and the Wives of Warriors group presented red roses to the families of the survivors. That included Teresa Spencer, whose husband Shannon Police Chief Bobby Spencer’s name was finally added to the state and national memorial walls this year. Spencer was shot and killed as he walked into the Shannon Police Department in January 1997.</p>

<p>According to organizer Cpl. Rob Edwards of the Tupelo Police Department, there were 137 officers across the nation killed in 2017. So far this year, 51 officers have been killed in the line of duty.</p>

<h2 id="veronapolicequietaboutkidnappingarrest">Verona police quiet about kidnapping arrest</h2>

<p id="byline">by: William Moore</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-17</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/news/verona-police-quiet-about-kidnapping-arrest/article_2b6478d3-8682-5960-ab36-f8967eba047d.html </p>

<p>TUPELO – Few details are being released by Verona police officials regarding a Tupelo man who has been in the Lee County Jail for a week, facing multiple felony charges, including kidnapping.</p>

<p>Midrecus D. Stevens, 23, of 1003 Coolidge St., Tupelo, was arrested and brought to the jail last Saturday night by Verona police officer Jeff Willard. The jail’s docket book shows Stevens was booked into the jail May 12 at 8:08 p.m. on charges of robbery, kidnapping and violation of probation.</p>

<p>Following several violent crimes, including one fatality in recent months, Verona Police Chief J.B. Long told the Daily Journal he had been advised not to comment about ongoing cases.</p>

<p>Court documents, however, were able to provide more details on the arrest and the incidents that led to the charges.</p>

<p>On May 11, the Booneville Police Department went to a Stanley Street apartment to serve an outstanding warrant on Coreno Jaquin Pruitt, 19, of Tupelo, for a January incident in Booneville. During that arrest, police found Stevens in the apartment and determined he was wanted by Verona police for robbery. He was apprehended and later transferred to the Lee County Jail.</p>

<p>According to court documents that list Stevens’ address as East Jefferson Street, Okolona, the charges go back to an April 27 incident in Verona. He is accused of robbing a man at gunpoint and stealing his iPhone 5.</p>

<p>Affidavits filed in Lee County Justice Court and signed by Long say that Stevens not only held a gun to the victim’s head, but he also pistol whipped the victim “causing several swellings to the head.” Long’s sworn testimony said the victim was held against his will in the back seat of a vehicle, “causing him to fear for his life.”</p>

<p>At some point the victim, who the Daily Journal has chosen not to identify, was knocked unconscious, thrown in a creek and left in the water.</p>

<p>Court documents state that Chief Long took Stevens to justice court for his initial appearance on Monday where he was charged with aggravated assault, armed robbery and kidnapping. Judge Sadie Holland set bond at $100,000 total for all three charges. The probation violation charges will be handled separately.</p>

<p>Stevens has been arrested in the past. In 2013, Tupelo police arrested him on a sexual battery charge. In May 2015, Saltillo police charged him with six counts of burglary of a vehicle. The following year, two more counts of car burglary led to a conviction and probation.</p>

<p>According to a Booneville PD release, at the time of his arrest, Pruitt was also wanted by Verona PD on an outstanding robbery warrant. It is unclear if that charge is connected with the April 26 kidnapping incident.</p>

<h2 id="expandedadvisoryboardtalksengagementstrategy">Expanded advisory board talks engagement strategy</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Caleb Bedillion</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-08</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/news/local/expanded-advisory-board-talks-engagement-strategy/article_d61c8af5-9b6e-5e63-9d06-c40188b0bd7f.html </p>

<p>TUPELO – A newly expanded police advisory board met for the first time Wednesday and continues to discern how best to engage the public.</p>

<p>In recent weeks, the Tupelo City Council has approved Bridgette Wilson and Marcus McCoy to sit on a now-11-member board intended to boost communication between local neighborhoods and the Tupelo Police Department.</p>

<p>Both have credentials, which may shorten the learning curve as they settle in on the board.</p>

<p>Wilson has nearly completed a three-month academy, which offers training in police procedures, criminal law and related topics. The recurring class is offered by TPD as a community outreach effort.</p>

<p>Completion of the academy is mandatory for advisory board members, but a handful of current members held their seats for months while waiting for an academy to begin.</p>

<p>McCoy served on the committee that studied the possibility of a police advisory board and ultimately recommended its creation, giving him insight into the circumstances and deliberations around its charter.</p>

<p>He hopes the advisory board continues to pursue “a good working relationship with the citizens of Tupelo,” on behalf of local law enforcement, McCoy said.</p>

<p>McCoy and Wilson take their seats as the advisory board continues to grapple with how best to fulfill its mission.</p>

<p>Nearly two years ago, controversy and racial tensions followed the shooting death of Antwun “Ronnie” Shumpert by a Tupelo police officer. These difficulties led Mayor Jason Shelton’s administration to implement a handful of initiatives intended to mend rifts.</p>

<p>The advisory board was never intended to investigate or exercise direct oversight over the police department, as some local activists had hoped. Instead, it began to meet almost a year ago with a mandate to foster communication and act as a conduit for information.</p>

<p>However, the board’s early months were given over primarily to internal training, steeping board members with instruction in the outlook and policies of Tupelo police.</p>

<p>Since January, board chairman Bill Allen has reiterated a commitment to engage with the public. He has repeatedly encouraged advisory members to appear at neighborhood association meetings and other events.</p>

<p>Recent attempts by the NAACP and the Park Hill neighborhood association to host a panel of advisory board members have been hampered by miscommunication and scheduling conflicts.</p>

<p>Tupelo Chief Operations Officer Don Lewis suggested the advisory board establish as a goal that members will visit at least one community event a month.</p>

<p id="byline">by: Caleb Bedillion</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-17</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/news/local/diversity-push-yields-new-advisory-board-member/article_edcbb09a-b1e0-5021-b1a8-b0d05d15ca64.html </p>

<p>TUPELO – The Tupelo City Council has approved the first of two new police advisory board members, giving that citizen panel its second black member as well as its second female member.</p>

<p>Bridgette Wilson was nominated to the advisory board by Mayor Jason Shelton and approved Tuesday night on a 6-1 council vote.</p>

<p>“She will serve that committee well and will bring much needed diversity in race and gender,” Shelton told council members during a Monday afternoon agenda review session.</p>

<p>Ward 6 Councilman Mike Bryan cast the lone dissenting vote. Bryan said his vote was motivated by opposition to the very existence of the board, not by any concerns about Wilson’s fitness to serve.</p>

<p>A corporate risk manager for North Mississippi Health Services, Wilson is a current participant in a citizens police academy offered by the Tupelo Police Department.</p>

<p>Wilson signed up for the course seeking only to inform herself as a citizen. Now that she’s been chosen to sit on the police advisory board, she is eager to help inform not only herself but others.</p>

<p>“I thought this was a good opportunity to be someone in the middle and help bring the police and the community together,” Wilson said of her appointment to the board.</p>

<p>The citizens police academy has been among a raft of efforts pushed by the police department to increase its engagement with Tupelo’s citizenry.</p>

<p>The advisory board itself is another such effort. Formed nearly a year ago, the board nonetheless has been criticized for its nearly all-white composition.</p>

<p>A push backed by Shelton’s administration to expand the advisory board from nine to 11 members is intended to address this issue.</p>

<p>Shelton still has yet to make one more nomination to the advisory board. Tupelo Public School District board of trustees member Ken Wheeler was considered for the nod, but his residency outside the city limits derailed his nomination.</p>

<p>Shelton’s Chief Operations Officer Don Lewis said efforts to identify a second nominee are ongoing.</p>

<p>TUPELO – A proposed expansion of the police advisory board will likely advance before the City Council next week, along with the names of two new nominees to the board.</p>

<p>Current advisory board members learned this information during a Wednesday morning meeting at Tupelo Police Department headquarters.</p>

<p>In response to community concerns about its racial composition, advisory board members requested last month the addition of two new seats, with a presumption voiced that those seats will be filled by black candidates.</p>

<p>Tupelo Chief Operations Officer Don Lewis told the advisory board that additional nominees have been vetted.</p>

<p>Of the two anticipated nominees, Lewis named Bridgette Wilson as expected to go before the City Council for confirmation.</p>

<p>A second name has been selected, however, Lewis said a recent question about residency has arisen and is undergoing investigation.</p>

<p>The ordinance that created the advisory board will require modification to expand the board from nine to 11 members.</p>

<p>The administration will ask the City Council to amend the advisory board ordinance and approve the new nominees during a meeting next week, Lewis said.</p>

<p>Each City Council member is currently allowed one nominee to the board, while the mayor has two nominees. The current proposal would empower the mayor to make a total of four nominations to the board, though all nominees will continue to require confirmation by the full council.</p>

<p>The nine-member advisory board has only one black member, as well as one Hispanic member. All other members are white.</p>

<p>The advisory board was among a package of initiatives proposed last year by Mayor Jason Shelton to improve communication and build trust between the Tupelo Police Department and a number of predominantly black neighborhoods where trust in law enforcement is low.</p>

<p>TUPELO – Posts on social media of a Thursday evening shooting in Tupelo are false, according to the Tupelo Police Department.</p>

<p>Some posts on Facebook indicated that an 8-year-old boy and his father were shot and killed. Other versions said police fired the shots.</p>

<p>But the Tupelo Police Department said the reports have not been substantiated in any way.</p>

<p>"We responded to a report of shots fired in the President's Gate/Hilldale areas Thursday evening," said TPD spokesman Capt. Chuck McDougald, referring to the apartment complexes on Lawndale and Monument drives. "We failed to find any suspects, victims or evidence that a shooting had occurred."</p>

<p>He said police checked with the hospital and other medical facilities and had no notifications of anyone seeking medical treatment for gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>"As far as we can tell, this is just a rumor," McDougald said. "If someone has any information that a shooting did happen, we encourage them to call us or Crime Stoppers."</p>

<p>Anyone with information is urged to call the Tupelo Police Department at (662) 841-6491 or Crime Stoppers at (800) 773-TIPS.</p>

<p>TUPELO – On the heels of a request that two new members be installed on Tupelo’s police advisory board, additional efforts are underway by the board to build a stronger community presence.</p>

<p>Ongoing talks could soon yield appearances by advisory members before meetings of the local NAACP as well as other community gatherings.</p>

<p>“Communication and good transparency, that’s what the community wants and that’s what we’re looking for,” said local NAACP President Chris Traylor. “I just want them to come down and explain the process of the advisory board and how it could be a resource for the community.”</p>

<p>Last year, the City Council created a citizen panel to advise the police department on matters of policy and to help forge stronger links between law enforcement and local communities, particularly some predominantly black neighborhoods where longstanding suspicions of the city’s police force exist.</p>

<p>Closing in on a year since they began to meet, board members have appeared particularly keen, since the beginning of this year, to take a more public-facing role.</p>

<p>In addition to the NAACP meeting, currently expected to occur at the end of April, board member Aaron Washington recently told the Daily Journal he hopes to coordinate with local churches to win a wider audience for the board and its mission.</p>

<p>Washington is the only black member of the nine-member advisory board. Mayor Jason Shelton has backed a plan to increase the board’s membership by two additional seats in a bid to increase its racial diversity.</p>

<p>One thing is not set to change, however. The advisory board will continue to hold its monthly meetings at the Tupelo Police Department headquarters on Front Street, on the second Wednesday of each month.</p>

<p>Some board members and local activists had previously floated the idea that the monthly meetings could occur at various times and locations that might be more accessible and inviting to a wider cross-section of the community.</p>

<p>Traylor, for example, has suggested that community members are hesitant to address any concerns about the police department to the advisory board in the presence of police leadership.</p>

<p>Advisory board chairman Bill Allen told the Daily Journal that no consensus could be reached around alternative meeting arrangements.</p>

<p>He expressed optimism, however, that appearances by advisory board members before community organizations and neighborhood associations can begin to forge the ties needed for the board to fulfill its stated mission.</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/opinion/our-opinion-diversity-would-boost-police-advisory-board/article_d64cd9dd-f204-516b-a14a-50ea914364f3.html </p>

<p>Tupelo’s City Council last year created a police advisory board after community concerns arose following the fatal shooting of a man by a Tupelo police officer.</p>

<p>Although the officer was later cleared of wrongdoing, the incident also revealed a need to build stronger relationships between the police department and citizens, particularly members of minority communities. The board was billed as a tool to do just that.</p>

<p>Now, members of the board say they want to see greater diversity among their members.</p>

<p>We agree this is an important objective, and we urge city leaders to work carefully to reach this goal.</p>

<p>The Daily Journal’s Caleb Bedillion reported that advisory board members voted unanimously on Wednesday to request the City Council grant the mayor two additional nominations to the board.</p>

<p>Board Chairman Bill Allen said the intent is that Mayor Jason Shelton would use the additional nominations to increase the racial diversity on the panel.</p>

<p>The nine-member board currently has one black member. Its membership includes one other racial minority, who is Hispanic and is also the board’s only female member.</p>

<p>Under current rules, each City Council member may nominate one person to the advisory board, while the mayor may make two nominations. The slate of nine nominations must then receive approval from the full council.</p>

<p>The recommended change would bring the board membership to 11, with four of those members appointed by the mayor.</p>

<p>Shelton said he supports the proposed changes.</p>

<p>We also believe that such a change would be a good one. Given that the intent of the police advisory board was to build a stronger relationship between the community and police department, and given that the biggest concerns came from the African-American community, it would be wise to give members of that community greater representation.</p>

<p>That’s the best way to ensure the panel is more than symbolic but is an entity that can actually foster greater dialogue, transparency and trust. Adding voices, and making the board more reflective of Tupelo’s demographics, is the best way to truly open up lines of communication.</p>

<p>There are certainly legitimate concerns about not making the board too large to be truly effective. Allen said he did not think that an 11-member board would be too big, but he did caution against growing it much beyond that point.</p>

<p>Tupelo set itself apart when it became one of the first Mississippi communities, if not the first, to create a police advisory board. It must continue on that path by ensuring its board is as effective as possible and one that can serve as a model for communities throughout the state.</p>

<p>Having a diverse board that can foster relationships at the grassroots level is a key step toward doing that.</p>

<p>TUPELO – Police advisory board members want the City Council to expand the advisory board’s ranks to make room for increased racial diversity.</p>

<p>During a Wednesday morning meeting at the Tupelo Police Department headquarters, advisory board members present voted unanimously to request that the City Council grant the mayor two additional nominations to the advisory board.</p>

<p>Board Chairman Allen said the intent is that Mayor Jason Shelton will use these two additional nominations to increase the racial diversity represented on the panel, which was formed in part to address mistrust of local police evidenced from some quarters of the city.</p>

<p>“There is a problem among the African-American community, in that they feel there is not adequate representation on the board from African-Americans,” Allen said on Wednesday, reading from notes.</p>

<p>The nine-member board currently has only one black member. The board’s membership includes one other racial minority, who is Hispanic and also the board’s only female member.</p>

<p>Under current rules, each City Council member may nominate one person to the advisory board, while the mayor may make two nominations.</p>

<p>The slate of nine nominations must then receive approval from the full council.</p>

<p>The policy now recommended by the advisory board would bring the membership total to 11, with four of those members named by the mayor.</p>

<p>“We felt this would be the best way to address the issue,” Allen said.</p>

<p>In a brief interview with the Daily Journal, Allen said he did not think that an 11-member board would be cumbersome or too large, though he said he didn’t think the board should grow much larger.</p>

<p>In order to establish a rotation system whereby not all members end their term simultaneously, three members are set to reach the end of a one-year term later this year.</p>

<p>All three will be eligible for re-appointment to longer terms, but the council members responsible for those three appointments could decide to offer new names instead.</p>

<h2 id="ouropinionmentalhealthtrainingforofficersshouldcontinue">OUR OPINION: Mental health training for officers should continue</h2>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/opinion/editorials/our-opinion-mental-health-training-for-officers-should-continue/article_5a29f7e4-0b95-5260-8e62-0a5bf4b0f4fb.html </p>

<p>When law enforcement officials work hand-in-hand with mental health advocates, the result can be transformational for our communities.</p>

<p>A handful of officers in Northeast Mississippi spoke to that this week at the culmination of an intensive weeklong training session that helped prepare them to deal with those suffering from a mental illness.</p>

<p>Ten officers from the Tupelo Police Department and the Lee and Itawamba County sheriffs’ offices went through a Crisis Intervention Training program and got to tour facilities in Meridian and Lauderdale County, as well as talk directly to patients, as reported by the Daily Journal’s William Moore.</p>

<p>The comments these law enforcement officers had regarding just how beneficial the training was for them speaks volumes to the need for this to become commonplace throughout our region and state.</p>

<p>“I’ve seen a lot of people who were going through crisis, but never realized it,” said Cpl. Will Morgan of the Lee County Sheriff’s Office. “The training made me realize that some of the folks I thought were just not listening to me, might not have understood me. We responded to 15 calls (Tuesday) night, and four or five of them were legitimate mental health issues.”</p>

<p>The newly certified officers were treated to lunch Wednesday at Lifecore, where they got to meet another resource available to them, the mobile crisis emergency response team. Mobile crisis supervisor Kris Riddle said the team was organized in 2014 and responds to calls to the Lifecore hotline 24 hours a day.</p>

<p>Officials hope to see the training expand to include law enforcement agencies throughout Lifecore’s seven-county region – Benton, Chickasaw, Itawamba, Lee, Monroe, Pontotoc and Union counties.</p>

<p>So far, only three departments have gone through the training, but the need for more trained officers is there, officials said.</p>

<p>In addition to expanding the training, Lifecore chief executive officer Rita Berthay said the next step is to establish a point of entry, a site where adult patients can be taken and evaluated to see how best to serve their needs.</p>

<p>“It would only be four beds, but you would only hold them for 24 hours before they were released or transferred to the appropriate facility,” Berthay said. “We already have a facility. We just need to hire the staff.”</p>

<p>A bill for funding the center is currently before the state legislature in Jackson. Berthay said things look hopeful, but it could still be May before they know if funding is approved.</p>

<p>We applaud these officers and their superiors for taking the first proactive step to undergo this training and hope to see it continue with more departments throughout Northeast Mississippi.</p>

<p>Having a greater understanding of what those suffering from a mental illness are going through can only help our law enforcement officials continue to protect and serve all residents of our communities.</p>

<h2 id="shumpertfamilyappealfiledwithfederalappealscourt">Shumpert family appeal filed with federal appeals court</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Caleb Bedillion</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-31</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/news/local/shumpert-family-appeal-filed-with-federal-appeals-court/article_867427c3-8f11-51a0-b06f-0e6b7c036953.html </p>

<p>TUPELO – With written arguments now filed before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, the survivors of Antwun “Ronnie” Shumpert have mounted an effort to keep alive a civil case against the city of Tupelo and Tupelo Police Department officer Tyler Cook.</p>

<p>Last November, U.S. Northern District of Mississippi Chief Judge Sharion Aycock dismissed a wrongful death suit against Tupelo and Cook. This suit sought to prove that when Cook lethally shot Shumpert in June 2016, he deployed excessive force and deprived Shumpert of his constitutional rights.</p>

<p>In granting summary judgment, Aycock ruled that the evidence introduced into record revealed no issues of fact for a jury to decide and that the law clearly showed that the defendants would prevail.</p>

<p>Attorney Carlos Moore, who represents Shumpert's family, including widow Peggy Shumpert, argues otherwise. He is asking the 5th Circuit to reverse Aycock's summary judgment and send the case back to the federal Northern District of Mississippi.</p>

<p>Moore is also arguing that the district court erred in assessing financial penalties against Moore for failing to respond in a timely fashion to requests from lawyers representing the city and Cook.</p>

<p>Federal appeals courts do not hold trials on cases but only rule whether or not the law was correctly followed and applied by lower courts.</p>

<p>No new evidence is presented during the appeals process, and appeals judges sometimes make a decision based only on the written briefs rather than any oral argument.</p>

<p>Moore is requesting oral argument, but no ruling from the 5th Circuit on that matter has yet been issued.</p>

<p>In documents filed with the 5th Circuit on Wednesday, Moore reiterates many of his prior claims made in filings before the district court.</p>

<p>Within the public record, the following account has been accepted as fact by all parties: Shumpert fled from a traffic stop initiated by a TPD officer and hid in the crawlspace underneath a nearby home, where Cook found Shumpert. After ordering Shumpert to exit the crawl space, Cook then released a police dog to restrain Shumpert.</p>

<p>At this point, Cook has testified that Shumpert exited the crawlspace and attacked Cook, pinning the officer to the ground in the process. During the ensuing struggle, Cook has said that once he feared that he would lose consciousness, he shot Shumpert.</p>

<p>In the weeks following the June 2016 incident, Moore disputed Cook's version of events in a series of highly charged news conferences in which he invoked dramatic and violent images of the Civil Rights movement, including the use of dogs against peaceful protestors.</p>

<p>In shifting attention, Moore has shifted away from Shumpert's alleged attack of Cook and Cook's fatal shots and toward the early moments of the encounter when Cook found Shumpert in hiding.</p>

<p>Moore has argued that when Cook found Shumpert, he failed to follow TPD's “barricade” policy and its K9 policy. The Grenada attorney has also asserted that Police Chief Bart Aguirre's decision to transfer Cook into the K9 unit violated the department's own policies.</p>

<p>Aycock found these claims inadequate under the law to provide any basis for civil liability. Moore argues, however, that a jury should be allowed to consider these claims.</p>

<p>Lawyers defending Cook and the city of Tupelo have not yet filed a response with the 5th Circuit to Moore's latest arguments.</p>

<h2 id="ouropinionbodycamsprovingtobevaluabletoolforall">OUR OPINION: Body cams proving to be valuable tool for all</h2>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/opinion/editorials/our-opinion-body-cams-proving-to-be-valuable-tool-for/article_087ec74d-e23c-51c4-9b8f-27739773635a.html </p>

<p>The jury is still somewhat out on the overall effectiveness of the body-worn cameras that police departments across Northeast Mississippi have embraced in the last few years.</p>

<p>Following a number of officer-involved shootings across the country, the body cams – as they are more commonly referred – have become one more tool police officers carry with them while protecting and serving. The cameras record enforcement activities by officers, with advocates saying they provide a critical level of transparency to help combat potential police brutality and excessive force.</p>

<p>As part of a statewide effort, the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi reviewed the policies and procedures of body cams at police departments in the state. All in all, the ACLU of Mississippi obtained 65 policies through public records requests.</p>

<p>In studying the various policies, ACLU of Mississippi leaders felt that most policies in the state are rendering body cameras inadequate and comprised tools for law enforcement officers.</p>

<p>Organization leaders are recommending the state legislature enact a model body camera policy into state law. This law would not require any given agency to deploy body cameras but would enforce uniform policies among those that do, as reported by the Daily Journal’s Caleb Bedillion.</p>

<p>Key findings found during the statewide review include that no policies mandate law enforcement officers to notify civilians they interact with that a recording device is in use and that no policies allow apparent domestic violence victims the right to request camera deactivation during interviews with law enforcement, among other items.</p>

<p>The ACLU report does show the Tupelo Police Department has stronger provisions in place to safeguard accountability and privacy than most other agencies in Mississippi.</p>

<p>For example, Tupelo is the only law enforcement agency in the state that forbids officers from viewing all body camera footage from an incident before filing a written report.</p>

<p>Officers are allowed to view footage after the initial report and may file supplemental reports later, if needed. The city’s police department is also only one of two agencies in the state that contains a general prohibition against the use of body cameras to record peaceful protests or demonstrations. Also alone in the state, Tupelo grants subjects recorded by body cameras the right to review footage of themselves.</p>

<p>These provisions unique to our community showcase a true effort by city and police leaders alike to implement a policy that seeks to use the cameras for exactly what they are intended. As Tupelo Police Chief Bart Aguirre noted, the cameras have been embraced by the department as tools to promote transparency, train officers and gather evidence.</p>

<p>With those intentions in mind and strong policies in place to keep all those involved accountable, body cams can end up being beneficial for both the police and the community. Much more discussion should be had, however, before any sort of statewide policy is implemented to ensure those that need to be at the table have an opportunity to share best practices as well as valid concerns.</p>

<p id="byline">by: Caleb Bedillion</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-07</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/news/local/body-camera-policies-in-mississippi-fail-to-safeguard-transparency-aclu/article_1380a3a9-6f07-5b2d-a0e2-a5abf3bd875d.html </p>

<p>TUPELO – Many law enforcement agencies in the state allow body worn cameras to be used in ways that undercut accountability and transparency, according to a report released Monday by the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi.</p>

<p>As police departments and sheriff’s offices increasingly adopt the use of body worn video cameras to record enforcement activities by officers, a patchwork of sometimes very different and inconsistent policies has developed.</p>

<p>The ACLU of Mississippi conducted a statewide study of these policies, obtaining 65 in total through public records requests.</p>

<p>Across the nation, law enforcement agencies have increasingly adopted body cameras, in part, in response to controversies over police shootings, claims of brutality and excessive force.</p>

<p>However, Blake Feldman, an ACLU of Mississippi advocacy coordinator and the primary author of the report released today, outlined his view that most policies in the state render body cameras inadequate and compromised tools.</p>

<p>“For body cameras to promote trust between police and the community, police must use them in a way that carefully balances interests in police accountability, government transparency and privacy,” Feldman said in a written statement released Monday. “In the policies we analyzed, we found inconsistent implementation guidance, a lack of privacy safeguards and bare minimum provisions.”</p>

<p>The ACLU report does show that the Tupelo Police Department has stronger provisions in place to safeguard accountability and privacy than most other agencies in Mississippi.</p>

<p>In response to its findings, the ACLU of Mississippi is recommending that the state legislature enact a model body camera policy into state law. This law would not require any given agency to deploy body cameras but would enforce uniform policies among those that do.</p>

<p>“As a result of the vast disparities from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, Mississippians now face a bewildering array of policies governing the use of” body cameras, argues the ACLU written report. “It is reckless to have varying policies from community to community.”</p>

<pre><code>•   Many policies allow an officer to view body camera footage of an incident before filing a written report on that incident. Some policies restrict this ability.

•   Most policies do not allow for individuals recorded by a body camera to review the footage in which they appear. Some policies do allow this, but only if it would advance an investigation or allow it only at the discretion of a sheriff or police chief.

•   No policies mandate law enforcement officers to notify civilians they interact with that a recording device is in use. Some policies do suggest that officers should inform individuals they being recorded, including Northeast Mississippi agencies such as the Aberdeen Police Department, the Booneville Police Department, the Nettleton Police Department and the Pontotoc Police Department.

•   No policies allow apparent domestic violence victims the right to request camera deactivation during interviews with law enforcement.

<p>Officers are allowed to view footage after the initial report and may file supplemental reports later if needed.</p>

<p>Some other agencies bar officer review after a use of force incident or grant command staff the discretionary authority to limit officer review.</p>

<h2 id="naacpurgescommunityinvolvementfrompoliceadvisoryboard">NAACP urges community involvement from police advisory board</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Caleb Bedillion</p>

<p id="date">date: 2017-12-12</p>

<p id="link">url: http://www.djournal.com/news/local/naacp-urges-community-involvement-from-police-advisory-board/article_f8a85919-00dc-5519-9777-d8109a9a997a.html </p>

<p>TUPELO – Lee County NAACP President Chris Traylor has urged the city of Tupelo’s recently formed police advisory board to forge stronger links with the community in order to further its mission of fostering improved relations between citizens and law enforcement.</p>

<p>Traylor addressed the advisory panel of citizen volunteers during a Wednesday morning meeting and recounted his support for law enforcement but offered suggestions for improvement.</p>

<p>“I think you need to take the board into the community,” Traylor said.</p>

<p>Advisory board chairman Bill Allen said that on this point, Traylor has been heard.</p>

<p>“We need to get out more” and “listen more,” Allen said, urging the advisory board to make these initiatives a priority in 2018.</p>

<p>These public remarks followed a private meeting last week over the apparent concerns from some quarters of the community over the police advisory board.</p>

<p>According to participants, this meeting last week brought together Allen and advisory board members Aaron Washington and Bob Baughn along with Traylor, other NAACP members and City Council members Willie Jennings and Nettie Davis.</p>

<p>In this meeting and in his public comments Wednesday, Traylor also acknowledged frustration from some that the board, which was intended in part to foster outreach to black members of the community, has little racial diversity.</p>

<p>The nine-member board has seven white members, one black member and one Hispanic member. Each City Council member nominated one board member, and Mayor Jason Shelton made two nominations.</p>

<p>Traylor acknowledged that the board members themselves can’t control its overall makeup, but he urged that this matter remain under discussion.</p>

<p>“I would like to see in the near future an improvement of the board’s diversity,” Traylor said.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Daily Journal, Traylor said he believes that, at the present, many community members feel hesitant about attending advisory board meetings to voice concerns they may have about the department.</p>

<p>He pointed out that the meetings occur at the police department and typically have a heavy presence of TPD leadership in attendance.</p>

<p>“It can be intimidating for someone,” Traylor said.</p>

<p>Any Tupelo resident can address the advisory board by contacting the office of TPD Police Chief Bart Aguirre in advance and submitting a written form.</p>

<p>The advisory board was formed this year by vote of the Tupelo City Council and held its first meeting in June.</p>

<p>Since then, the advisory board’s monthly meetings have mostly involved reports from a rotating roster of police department leadership, including crime reports and sometimes lengthy briefing sessions on police department policies and practices.</p>

<p>Allen has emphasized that he felt these briefing sessions were necessary to educate the advisory board members about the department.</p>

<p>However, with those members set to take a 12-week citizens police academy next year, Allen seems increasingly ready to steer the advisory board toward a more public-facing role.</p>

<p>The year was 1992. I was a second-grader at Rankin Elementary when our teacher told us that McGruff, the famous crime dog, would be visiting our classroom.</p>

<p>While others were in awe of the appearance, I didn’t think much of it. McGruff, to me, was just an animated version of a trench-coated Robert Stack from “Unsolved Mysteries,” a show I wasn’t allowed to watch but often sneaked viewings.</p>

<p>By this point in my life, I’d already met Smokey Bear and discovered only I could prevent forest fires, a problem I assumed I’d face a lot in my adult life – right up there with quicksand and falling anvils, given how much I’d heard about all three. To this day I can safely say I’ve never encountered or, to my knowledge, been responsible for any of the three.</p>

<p>But, in ‘92, I was wiser, knew it was everyone’s part to prevent forest fires and was about to face yet another six-foot-tall costumed prevention animal.</p>

<p>While my classmates and I were tasked with coming up with questions to ask McGruff about crime, I went a different route.</p>

<p>We were told McGruff would have a handler with him to communicate. We would be asking the questions to McGruff and the handler would be answering.</p>

<p>I didn’t care for that. This dog was allowed to waste my time but I wasn’t allowed to waste his? For whatever reason, I had convinced myself that Clifford (of big, red fame) and McGruff were related. Perhaps brothers. Thanksgiving must have been fun in that household, with the grizzled detective McGruff and the giant, free-wheelin’ Clifford. You could clearly see who the parents loved more.</p>

<p>Why I believed they were in the same family is beyond me. I knew they weren’t real. I knew they were both animated and that a costume was made of one of them for classroom purposes. But I didn’t care. In my mind, they were siblings and based on that observation, I had my question basically written for me: I was going to ask McGruff about the size ratio between them.</p>

<p>So the following week, McGruff and his handler, a “police officer” (to this day I’m not sure if this was actually someone from the Tupelo Police Department or just another costumed character) came to visit and were immediately rushed by an onslaught of 6- and 7-year-olds for hugs and ear-tugging. An event that I can only imagine is extremely annoying even without a giant, hot, heavy costume.</p>

<p>But as the questions lingered, varying from subjects such as, “will I go to jail if I lie?” to someone asking about Miranda and why she should have rights, to one student who claimed he’d seen a murder (he hadn’t), it was clear time was running short and I was not going to get to ask my all-important question.</p>

<p>As McGruff exited, he passed in front of me and I found my window. I grabbed his paw, pulled him to me and said, “Why are you so small?”</p>

<p>Clearly, this was the worst possible way to phrase my query, as I just assumed he’d know I meant “in relation to Clifford.” But the kind-hearted crime dog had apparently had enough of children, was possibly inebriated and was definitely suffering from an existential crisis of being a grown man inside a dog costume as a full-time job. From within the cold, dead eyes of that mask I heard, “Why are you so stupid?”</p>

<p>TUPELO – A panel of prosecutors and judges fielded questions about the criminal justice system Monday night, honing in on issues of drug rehabilitation, incarceration alternatives and the youth court system.</p>

<p>A sparse crowd with few members of the public sat in on a public forum at the Midtown Pointe mall, with Tupelo Police Department Lt. Katarsha White serving as moderator.</p>

<p>Monday’s discussion was the latest installment of an initiative pushed by Tupelo Mayor Jason Shelton’s administration to host a series of public forums engaging the community on issues of policing and law enforcement.</p>

<p>White posed questions to officials such as District Attorney John Weddle, Assistant District Attorney Sadie Gardner, County Court Judge Charlie Britt, city of Tupelo municipal prosecutor Richard Babb and city of Tupelo municipal judge Willie Allen.</p>

<p>Treatment options and incarceration alternatives for drug abusers emerged as a recurrent theme.</p>

<p>In drug cases, Gardner said pretrial diversion is sometimes possible, a program that gets someone into a treatment option in lieu of criminal prosecution by the District Attorney’s office.</p>

<p>In other cases, drug offenders are routed into the criminal justice system but placed in the drug court system, which is designed primarily to remedy addiction and produce rehabilitation.</p>

<p>In general, Gardner said alternative sentencing programs exist “to help offenders who are not bad people, they’ve just made bad decisions that led them down a bad path.”</p>

<p>“We try to use the leverage of the law to get people into rehab,” Babb said.</p>

<p>Prosecutors and justices can only work within the system that exists, however.</p>

<p>Other questions focused on juvenile justice, with Britt, a county court judge who also serves as youth court judge, explaining that treatment programs and facilities for troubled or drug addicted youth are sparse and face funding difficulties.</p>

<p>Other questions focused on more procedural facets of local courts, including the relative jurisdictions of municipal court, circuit court and youth courts.</p>

<p>Weddle also explained the grand jury process, the engine that drives felony prosecutions pursued by his office.</p>

<p>With an eye toward the thin crowd at Monday’s forum, White told the Daily Journal that TPD remains committed to dialogue with the community.</p>

<p>She said the department is very interested if community organizations or houses of worship would like to invite TPD staff to come take questions and hear concerns from members of the public.</p>
