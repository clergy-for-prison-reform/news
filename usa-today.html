<h2 id="voteridmagahatsandtimberlarcenymypollworkertrainingformississippielections">Voter ID, MAGA hats and timber larceny: My poll worker training for Mississippi elections</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Margaret McMullan</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-28</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/05/29/voter-id-maga-hats-mississippi-poll-worker-training-column/649461002/ </p>

<p>I learned all about voter ID, MAGA hats, belligerent voters ('just smile') and crimes that disenfranchise when I trained as a poll worker in Mississippi.</p>

<p>GULFPORT, Miss. — We’re stuck on Current and Valid Photo IDs.</p>

<p>Our trainer, Renick Taylor, hands a driver’s license to the African American woman in the front row. “Is this a valid ID?”</p>

<p>She reads the card, then tilts it to see the state seal wink. “Yes,” she says, definitively.</p>

<p>“Check out the photo,” Taylor says. “Does it match the person standing in front of you?”</p>

<p>The card’s picture shows a young, thin man with short, brown hair. Taylor is middle-aged, with a belly and long hair pulled back in a ponytail.</p>

<p>“No!” she says.</p>

<p>“Can I still vote?”</p>

<p>We all hesitate with her. The photo clearly does not look like the man standing in front of us. Are we required to match the person to the picture exactly?</p>

<p>I am with 40 other people in the civil defense room of the Harrison County Courthouse. By noon, we will be official poll workers, ready for Mississippi's June 5 primaries for U.S. Senate and House seats.</p>

<p>More: Tell voters in real time if adversaries try to hack and manipulate elections</p>

<p>More: I agree with Donald Trump, we should have voter ID. Here's how and why.</p>

<p>I’m training to be a poll worker because I was born in Mississippi and my husband and I moved here three years ago. We registered to vote our first week back, and we got new state driver’s licenses to use as photo IDs to vote. The paperwork was more complicated than I expected — the state required an actual Social Security card, which I’d lost long ago and now needed to replace, which meant another trip to another office.</p>

<p>It felt like Mississippi was intentionally making each task difficult. I managed, but I wondered if and how others did. I vowed then to get involved in the voting process.</p>

<p>“So?” Taylor asks. “Can I vote?” I imagine him standing in front of me on Election Day, ready to challenge me.</p>

<p>“No?” says the woman in the front row.</p>

<p>The answer is yes, Taylor can still vote. “I might not look like I did a few years ago,” he says. “Some people gain weight. Some lose weight, but the ID still has their fat face. They can still vote.”</p>

<p>Taylor shows a Power Point slide explaining Current and Valid Photo ID. The word Current means within 10 years. Even if the ID expired 10 years ago, it’s considered current. Valid means your ID does not appear to be forged or fake.</p>

<p>All morning, Taylor teaches us.</p>

<p>A person over 18 can present any one of these IDs: A driver's license, a Photo ID card issued by a branch, department or entity of the State of Mississippi, a U.S. passport, a government employee ID card, a firearms license, a student photo ID issued by an accredited Mississippi university, college or community/junior college, a U.S. military ID, a tribal photo ID, any other photo ID issued by any branch, department, agency or entity of the U.S. government or any state government, a Mississippi Voter ID Card. If you don’t have any of these, you can apply for a free voter ID card at any Mississippi Circuit Clerk’s office.</p>

<p>“If your voter is belligerent,” Taylor says, “just smile.”</p>

<p>Phrasing is everything. He advises us not to say, “Democrat or Republican?” Rather, “Would you like to vote in the Democrat or Republican primary?”</p>

<p>If your voter is in the wrong precinct, tell her she must go to the precinct where she’s registered. This is important. In some states, you can vote anywhere. Not in Mississippi. Taylor says it’s often helpful to swing the laptop around at this point. “Show them where the poll book says they need to vote,” he says. “The ultimate authority is the poll book.”</p>

<p>Taylor holds up the blue plastic ballot box. That’s it. The paper trail. The trick will be to get the ballots safely and legally into that box. Then get that box safely and legally to the courthouse.</p>

<p>If an unusual occurrence takes place, we fill out a form marked Unusual Occurrences. Taylor calls it the CYA. The Cover Your Ass sheet.</p>

<p>And if we see police lingering or a squad car parked too close to polling, we should ask them to leave. Their presence counts as intimidation. “This might be your only chance to tell the police to scram,” Taylor says.</p>

<p>Taylor reminds us that no campaign materials or logos should be anywhere within 150 feet of the polls. If someone is wearing a campaign T-shirt, we should ask him to change or take off the shirt and wear it inside out. A woman asks about President Trump’s red Make America Great Again caps. Taylor says they no longer count as campaign material. “MAGA could also mean My Attorney Got Arrested.”</p>

<p>We view the tools of our democracy — the new touch screen laptops, the secrecy folders, the rolls of white tape, the ballot cards, and the flash drive that goes into the transparent Media Bag. He shows us the blue, green, red, and gold bags marked Affidavits, Spoiled Ballots, Absentee Ballots and Challenged Ballots. It looks like an REI camping kit.</p>

<p>We’re near the end.</p>

<p>Someone points out we haven’t gone over Challenged Ballots.</p>

<p>“Anybody can challenge a voter,” Taylor says in a measured tone. “It has been known to happen.”</p>

<p>Wait. What?</p>

<p>I imagine some Faulkner-like scenario of a man in overalls running into the voting room, yelling that his neighbor can’t vote because of a horse he stole or a barn he burned.</p>

<p>But this is no joke.</p>

<p>More: Turn Election Day into Election Weekend. We need more voter turnout, not less.</p>

<p>POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media</p>

<p>Most people protest a vote because of the state’s disenfranchising laws, Taylor says. Under Mississippi’s 1873 Constitution, once you’re convicted of a felony, you lose the right to vote, often, even after you’re served your sentence. Mississippi has the second-highest rate of disenfranchised voters in the country. A report from the Sentencing Project estimates that state law currently disenfranchises 218,181 Mississippians.</p>

<p>Taylor shows us the slide listing Mississippi’s disenfranchising crimes — murder, rape, bribery, theft, arson, perjury, forgery, timber larceny and more. No mention of pedophiles or drug dealers. They can still vote.</p>

<p>Even if the person is challenged, they might still be registered. Taylor puts his hand on one of the laptops we’ll use. “Just check the poll book. Why?”</p>

<p>Because the ultimate authority is the poll book, we say.</p>

<p>I’m sitting up straighter now. We all are. We are poll workers. We work in pairs. We use red ink. We are armed with forms. We have a checklist for everything.</p>

<p>“But what if the voter doesn’t have any ID?” a man in the back row asks. He’s still stuck on the IDs. The class responds: Fill out an affidavit! Tell her to run home and look! Tell her to get an ID and bring it to the courthouse within five days!</p>

<p>Taylor is solemn now. He urges us to do everything we can not to turn people away. Why? Because, he says, no voter should be refused the right to vote.</p>

<h2 id="westvirginiateachersvictoryshowspowerofwomenasmorebattlesloom">West Virginia teachers' victory shows 'power of women' as more battles loom</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alia E. Dastagir</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-07</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/03/08/west-virginia-teachers-victory-shows-power-women-more-battles-loom/403374002/ </p>

<p>It's back to school in West Virginia. Teachers across the Appalachian mountain state are reopening classrooms Wednesday, jubilant after their governor signed a 5 percent pay raise that ended their nine-day walkout. (March 7) AP</p>

<p>For nearly two weeks, teachers in West Virginia refused to go to work. They held massive rallies at the capitol almost daily, protesting low pay and rising health care costs. On the strike's ninth day, Gov. Jim Justice announced a deal to give all state employees a 5% raise and halt raising health insurance premiums. When it was over many teachers — exhausted, overjoyed and eager, they said, to get back to their students — wept.</p>

<p>The strike in West Virginia shows more than the power of collective organizing — it shows the power of women, political scientists and labor experts say.</p>

<p>More than three-quarters of public school teachers are female, the National Center for Education Statistics reported in 2017. Like so many gendered professions, teachers are notoriously underpaid and undervalued. Salaries for teachers in West Virginia rank 48th in the nation, according to the National Education Association, the country's largest teacher's union. To fight what they viewed as chronic mistreatment, educators went to battle with a male-dominated legislature that ranked 48th in the nation in terms of women's participation. They also faced a Republican governor who days before the strike had implied that they were “dumb bunnies.”</p>

<p>"Why did our governor and the senate president think that it was OK to disrespect the teachers in West Virginia that way? It's because we were women," said Carrena Rouse, president of the Boone County chapter of the American Federation of Teachers who has taught at Scott High School in Madison, W. Va., for 28 years. "Because they'd been used to getting away with that. And for me it was one of those points of, ‘No no no no — we’re not backing down from this thing. You picked the wrong fight.’”</p>

<p>Rouse, a mother of four boys, said many of the women she works with were fed up with what they saw as repeated assaults on both their profession and their gender. She and her colleagues, political scientists say, are part of a resurgence in women’s civic engagement.</p>

<p>“Women have a long history of labor activity, even before they had the right to vote,” said Jean Harris, a professor of political science and women's studies at the University of Scranton. But she said what the country's experiencing now is “a pattern of heightened participation by women of all ages, in all occupations and on all kinds of issues.”</p>

<p>At a time when many states are working to weaken the power of unions, 20,000 teachers in all 55 counties walked out of their classrooms, defying state law against their right to strike. Since many of the state's children receive free meals at school — West Virginia has a 17.9% poverty rate — teachers worked to provide food for them during the strike, one reason why many of their communities supported their efforts. The teachers' win may have inspired other workers, with strikes now being considered in Oklahoma and Arizona.</p>

<p>Personal takeaway from teacher picket line: West Virginia and U.S. need to rethink priorities</p>

<p>“I see it as the power of women engaged in collective organizing," said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the unions representing the educators in West Virginia. "I think if you looked at these disproportionately female professions, like teaching, people have basically been exploited for years because they care about kids. ... It was women taking a risk, deciding it had been too much."</p>

<p>The strike is part of a larger trend of women's activism in West Virginia, said Erin Cassese, a contributor to Gender Watch 2018, a non-partisan project of the Center for American Women and Politics and the Barbara Lee Family Foundation which is analyzing gender in the 2018 election. She said a new chapter of the National Organization for Women recently opened in Morgantown and a number of promising women candidates, Democrats and Republicans, are running in Congressional districts.</p>

<p>“I think that gender is going to continue to be an important dimension in electoral politics in the state," said Cassese, a West Virginia University political science professor.</p>

<p>Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women and Politics Institute at American University, said the strike may have ended, but lawmakers should expect those who participated to remain politically active. With the fight over high healthcare costs far from won and a constitutional amendment to end Medicaid funding for abortions on the table, more political battles loom large.</p>

<p>“[The strike] sends a clear signal to women that even in what has become a red state there are, when women mobilize, opportunities to take on policies that are to their advantage,” she said.</p>

<p>For her part, Rouse says she’s ready to fight.</p>

<p>"The women in this state deserve more. We're worthy of more. We're not just chattel. We're not a job that's traded for friends and family. Just because we're teachers doesn't mean that we deserve disrespect,” she said. "I think it's a countrywide problem where somewhere along the way it became OK to disrespect women. And I think we're coming back with a strong answer. I think we're coming back with the fire that I don't think they expected.”</p>

<p>YORK, Pa. — A 13-year-old girl has been charged with 15 felony counts of terroristic threats in connection with threats made to Central York School District last week.</p>

<p>The York County District Attorney's office announced the charges on Tuesday, the day after Central York resumed classes. School was closed three days last week because of the threats.</p>

<p>The girl is being charged as a juvenile because the offenses she's charged with don't meet the statutory criteria for an adult criminal offense, the district attorney's office said.</p>

<p>Unlike the adult system, there are no sentencing guidelines — minimum or maximum penalties — for juvenile offenders. A judge makes the ultimate disposition, according to Kyle King, a spokesman for the district attorney's office.</p>

<p>York defense attorney Chris Ferro also talked about the differences between the adult and juvenile criminal justice systems when it comes to possible punishments.</p>

<p>"There's a huge difference between the adult criminal justice system and the juvenile criminal justice system as it relates to penalty," Ferro said. "In the juvenile system, most sentencing is geared toward rehabilitation and treatment, not so much punishment."</p>

<p>Several mothers of Central York School District students explain their feelings after police have identified the source of the Central York School District threats. Anthony J. Machcinski, York Daily Record Anthony J. Machcinski, York Daily Record</p>

<p>There are no specific guidelines that mandate a specific penalty in the juvenile system, Ferro said. The judge has a lot of discretion with juvenile cases, and penalties could range from informal probation up to a long-term placement in a juvenile facility.</p>

<p>"There's always concerns of safety of the public, and I'm not saying that punishment doesn't play any role" in juvenile cases, Ferro said. "But the primary role is the child and the rehabilitative efforts to make sure this doesn't happen again."</p>

<p>One thing that is common in the criminal justice system is ordering the payment of restitution when appropriate. Restitution is "a fixed cost for the harm caused to a victim and it is something that would have to be paid by a juvenile" as part of their sentencing, Ferro said. He said it would have to be determined whether police overtime pay stemming from a criminal investigation could be recouped through restitution.</p>

<p>Police began investigating after two threats against Central York School District were discovered the night of Feb. 19 and the morning of Feb. 20. In response, police launched a task force and beefed up their presence at schools across the district. Central York School District, at the recommendation of police, closed Wednesday.</p>

<p>In the first threat, a Central York High School student on Feb. 19 overheard another in the hallway say, “Don’t come to school tomorrow.” Details became distorted as this information was shared and passed around on social media, police said.</p>

<p>A second threat, uncovered on social media the morning of Feb. 20, mentioned the police presence at the high school and in response, focused on the middle and elementary schools. Later that morning, another social media post threatened that the person would be "coming all week."</p>

<p>Classes resumed Monday. School officials said the day went well.</p>

<p>Big box stores retool their approach to entice a generation to visit their establishments. USA TODAY</p>

<p>The term "Millennial" gets thrown around so much in various studies, articles and general discussion that it's understandable if you thought the term had an agreed-upon definition.</p>

<p>But the definition of Millennial largely depends on whom you are talking to.</p>

<p>For example, the Pew Research Center — which has used cutoffs for Millennials ranging from 1992 to 1999 — never had an official definition for Millennial until Thursday when it declared that from here on it will define Millennials as people born between 1981 and 1996.</p>

<p>"Pew Research Center has been studying the Millennial generation for more than a decade," said Michael Dimock, president of the non-partisan, non-advocacy research giant. "But as we enter 2018, it’s become clear to us that it’s time to determine a cutoff point between Millennials and the next generation."</p>

<p>"In order to keep the Millennial generation analytically meaningful, and to begin looking at what might be unique about the next cohort, Pew Research Center will use 1996 as the last birth year for Millennials for our future work," Dimock said. "Anyone born between 1981 and 1996 (ages 22-37 in 2018) will be considered a Millennial, and anyone born from 1997 onward will be part of a new generation."</p>

<p>Although the next generation is often referred to as Generation Z, Pew decided "it's too early to give them a name" and will refer to them as post-Millennials until a common term takes hold.</p>

<p>"Generational cutoff points aren’t an exact science," Dimock said. And that point is illustrated by the fact that other "generational experts" have come up with very different cutoff points for Millennials.</p>

<p>Neil Howe and William Strauss, who are credited with coining the term Millennial in their 1991 book Generations, define the group as those born between 1982 and 2000. In his book, Not Everyone Gets a Trophy: How to Manage the Millennials, Bruce Tulgan defines two "waves" of Millennials: first wave (Generation Y) born 1978 to 1989, and second wave (Generation Z) born 1990 to 2000. And author David Stillman defines Millennials as people born between 1980 and 1994.</p>

<p>"Many have offered well-reasoned arguments for drawing that line a few years earlier or later than where we have," Dimock said. "Perhaps, as more data are collected over the years, a clear, singular delineation will emerge. We remain open to recalibrating if that occurs."</p>

<p>University of Virginia media studies professor Siva Vaidhyanathana — who said "at best" generational studies are "the equivalent of astrology and at worst a source of bigotry" — pointed to the muddy definitions as part of the problem with the concept of generations.</p>

<p>“I have been teaching at the university level for more than 20 years,” he said. “And ever since I started teaching, I’ve been told that I teach this strange creature called the Millennial. But nobody has been able to tell me when those Millennials arrived on Earth; no one has been able to tell me when those Millennials will be displaced and get out into the world so I am no longer teaching them; and every time I venture such a question I get a completely different set of answers, which is suspicious.”</p>

<p>Share your location, silence chatty group messages and hide embarrassing notification previews. These are some of the lesser known features of Apple's iPhone. Kim Komando, Special for USA TODAY</p>

<p>“Hey, can I call you?” I bet millions send this text every day. It’s common etiquette. You text first and see whether someone is busy. If you get a “Sure,” or “Y,” or “K,” you can ring that person up.</p>

<p>Texts used to be handy; now they’re an integral part of our lives. We hold entire conversations via text. We exchange GIFs, emojis, and videos with ease. Not sure what kind of butter to buy? Text your spouse a picture of two brands to get the answer.</p>

<p>Waiting for that response can be painful, especially if you’re not even sure the person has seen your text. But there is a way. Click here to find out if the recipient has read your text messages.</p>

<p>Here are iPhone texting tricks you wish you’ve known all along.</p>

<p>Reply directly from a notification</p>

<p>If you have an iPhone 6S (or later model), you’re probably familiar with 3D Touch even if you don’t use it very much. This feature lets you press your screen with different amounts of finger pressure to access more options. This is kind of like hovering over an icon with your mouse, but better. Once you start using 3D Touch, you get it.</p>

<p>For example, with 3D Touch, you don’t have to open the Messages app to reply to a message. Just do a long hard press on the lock-screen text notification itself to reply. If you’re in a hurry, this feature will save you time, although 3D Touch does require some practice.</p>

<p>Use 3D Touch for quick replies</p>

<p>You can also use 3D Touch for a long hard press on a text within the Messages app to send quick fun replies such as “like,” “heart,” “unlike,” “laughter” and question mark icons. This will spare you the task of browsing the full catalog of emojis for just the right one.</p>

<p>Related: Not sure what your teenager is texting about? Click here for a chart of inappropriate emojis. Warning: Some are NSFW.</p>

<p>Know how to copy and forward</p>

<p>Copying messages in Messenger can be tricky because it’s always hard to highlight a body of text on your phone using only your finger. But sometimes you want to forward the entire contents of text – to show it to someone else, to re-submit deleted info, or to archive important correspondence.</p>

<p>Instead of copying and pasting a message’s text to forward it, you can simply “long press” a message (similar to quick reply). Tap More on the bottom menu, and then select the arrow on the bottom left corner to forward it. The original message’s content will be copied as a new message. Just select the recipients as usual.</p>

<p>If it’s a really important text or conversation, save it outside of Messages. Click here to find out how to save your text messages.</p>

<p>Share your location with a tap</p>

<p>Why would you need to share your location with anyone on the Messages app? Parties, for one. You can easily direct lots of people to an obscure location, such as a cabin at the end of a spidery gravel road in the middle of the night. In theory, you could also use it for emergencies.</p>

<p>(For privacy reasons, you probably don’t want this feature on all the time. But in case you need it, you can easily share your location with anyone within the Messages app).</p>

<p>To share your location in the Messages app: Open a conversation thread then tap the little “i” icon in the upper-right corner of your screen to open the contact’s details.</p>

<p>To send your current location (including a map) to the particular contact, tap Send My Current Location.</p>

<p>If you want to send someone regular updates about your location, you can tap Share My Location instead.</p>

<p>On your kid’s phone, go to Contacts, and select your name.</p>

<p>On your own contact page, scroll down and tap Share My Location.</p>

<p>Choose between Share for One Hour, Share Until End of Day, or Share Indefinitely.</p>

<p>Save data with this quick fix</p>

<p>(Photo: Apple)</p>

<p>Sending photos via text messages can be data-intensive. If you have a mobile data cap, you can eat through it in no time. You don’t always need to send megabytes-worth of material by text message, especially when you’re not connected to Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>To save bandwidth, you can opt to send low-quality photos in your iPhone text messages instead. Here how’s you do it: Go to Settings >> Messages >> and scroll all the way down and toggle Low Quality Image Mode to On.</p>

<p>Stop the irritating alerts</p>

<p>The good news is that iPhones will send you two text alerts when you receive a message, as well as the optional accompanying sounds. This is a default setting, and you’ll receive the two alerts within a two-minute interval. While this is great for most occasions, I personally found it redundant.</p>

<p>To have your iPhone send single text alerts only, do this: Go to Settings >> Notifications >> Messages. Scroll down to Repeat Alert then set it to Never.</p>

<p>Silence maddening group messages</p>

<p>We often join a group-texting session, and we get the information we need, and then we think, “Okay, I’m done. No need for more texts.” But still the alerts ping, ping, and ping away, and they can easily get overwhelming. Thankfully, you can silence these group alerts on your iPhone.</p>

<p>To mute group message alerts, swipe left on the group message then tap Hide Alerts. You’ll then see a moon icon on the left side of the group to indicate that it’s muted. Nice.</p>

<p>More: Is your iPhone battery causing your smartphone to run slowly? Here's what to do</p>

<p>Make it harder to respond to the wrong message</p>

<p>Even seasoned texters can get confused about which conversation they’re responding to, especially if you have several group-texting sessions happening simultaneously. To avoid embarrassing miscommunications, you can organize your group-texts by giving them individual labels.</p>

<p>To name a group, simply open the conversation thread, tap the “i” icon on the top right then tap, Enter a Group Name.</p>

<p>Know who texts without looking at your phone</p>

<p>Similar to having special ringtones for your special someone, you also can set special text tones for specific contacts. This is great for knowing exactly who just sent you a text.</p>

<p>To set up a special text tone on your iPhone, select the specific Contact (on the Contacts app or the Phone app), then tap “Edit” on the upper right. Now on the “Text Tone” section, change it from “Default” to something else. You can also change the specific contact’s vibration alert in this section.</p>

<p>Block and silence the annoying ones</p>

<p>Do you have contacts who keep annoying you with text messages? Well, on the iPhone, you can simply block that contact and silence them.</p>

<p>Here’s how you do that: From the text conversation, tap the “i” icon on the top-right then tap the name or number at the tap. Select Block this Caller, then Block Contact to confirm. Don’t worry; you always have to option to unblock the contact later.</p>

<p>More: iPhone calculator + hidden backspace feature = Internet freakou</p>

<p>Hide embarrassing notification previews</p>

<p>Text notification previews are convenient. You can see the first few lines of a text before unlocking your phone, and thereby determine whether a response is urgent. The downside: Anyone can read your texts from the lock screen.</p>

<p>If you want to keep your text previews hidden on the lock screen and save yourself from potential embarrassment, go to Settings >> Notifications >> Messages then scroll down to Show Previews to set to When Unlocked or Never.</p>

<p>Start using this alternative to long texts</p>

<p>Don’t have time to tap away and send a long message to one of your friends? No problem.</p>

<p>You can record a voice note using Messages so your friend will receive an audio clip. It saves you time on long messages and also gives them the personal touch of hearing your voice.</p>

<p>Launch the Messages app on your iPhone or iPad.</p>

<p>Tap on an existing conversation with the person you would like to send a voice note to.</p>

<p>Tap and hold the microphone button and begin speaking into your phone’s microphone.</p>

<p>Swipe upwards to the quick send button (looks like a message bubble with an arrow in it).</p>

<p>If you mess up while recording, swipe your finger to the left in step 4 instead of upwards to cancel the voice message. Just tap and hold again to start the recording over.</p>

<h2 id="1in5americansaremakingaterrible401kmistake">1 in 5 Americans are making a terrible 401(k) mistake</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Matthew Frankel</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-02-11</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/retirement/2018/02/12/1-in-5-americans-are-making-a-terrible-401k-mistake/110251212/ </p>

<p>Balancing a retirement and college savings can be overwhelming. Here are 6 tips that will help ease the long-term planning. USA TODAY</p>

<p>If you aren't doing this one thing, you could cost yourself hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>Too many Americans underestimate the value of their employer-sponsored retirement savings accounts, particularly if the employer is willing to match some, or all, employee contributions. While the majority of workers with 401(k) plans contribute more than enough to take full advantage of their employer's matching program, there are still about 20% of people who don't.</p>

<p>This is perhaps one of the worst retirement mistakes you can make. Sure, it doesn't seem like a ton of money to be missing out on now, but you might be surprised at how much of a difference it can make when you eventually retire.</p>

<p>One of the worst retirement mistakes you can make</p>

<p>About 75% of companies offering 401(k) retirement plans offer some type of a matching program, generally based on an employee's contributions capped at a percentage of their salary. For example, a 401(k) matching policy may be "50% of employee contributions, up to 6% of total compensation." In other words, if you earn $50,000 per year and contribute $3,000 to your 401(k) — 6% of your salary — your employer will contribute an additional $1,500 on your behalf.</p>

<p>However, about one in five participants don't contribute enough to take full advantage of their employer match, according to several different surveys. Besides cashing out your 401(k) and spending the money, this is perhaps the worst retirement savings mistake you can make.</p>

<p>Why the employer match is so important</p>

<p>Here's a simplified example that shows why this is so important. Let's say that you earn $100,000 per year and that your employer will match 50% of your contributions, up to 5% of your salary. So, you choose to contribute $5,000 into your 401(k) each year and your employer matches 50% of your contributions for a total of $7,500 flowing into your account annually. Over a 30-year period, your account could be expected to grow to approximately $708,000, assuming 7% annualized investment returns.</p>

<p>On the other hand, let's say that you choose to contribute just 3% of your salary, which is a common automatic contribution level set by many employers. Including the employer match, this means that just $4,500 will go into your account per year. Each year, you're missing out on $1,000 in employer contributions that you could have received for contributing the 5% matching limit. What's more, a move like this can really add up over time — assuming the same 7% annualized returns, your account would only grow to about $425,000. That $283,000 difference could have a big impact on your financial security after retirement.</p>

<p>For this reason, the maximum contribution level your employer is willing to match should be the bare minimum you choose to put into your 401(k). Not doing so is literally turning down free money. Would you turn down a raise? Of course not. Not taking advantage of your employer match is just as silly.</p>

<p>It may seem like a lot now</p>

<p>This is an especially common mistake among younger people just starting out in their careers. Understandably, if you're starting your first job with an employer-sponsored retirement account, choosing to effectively reduce each of your paychecks by 5% or more to contribute to a retirement account may seem like a lot of money.</p>

<p>Plus, as I briefly mentioned earlier, many employers' 401(k) plans have automatic enrollment for new hires, often with a low contribution rate such as 2% or 3%. Many workers simply don't think to change it.</p>

<p>However, it's important to think about your employer's matching contributions as what they really are — a part of your compensation that you miss out on if you don't put enough into your retirement account.</p>

<h2 id="boysthesilentvictimsofsextrafficking">Boys — the silent victims of sex trafficking</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Tim Swarens</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-02-07</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/nation-now/2018/02/08/boys-silent-victims-sex-trafficking/1073799001/ </p>

<p>More than 1 million children, according to the International Labour Organization, are exploited each year in the commercial sex trade. IndyStar columnist Tim Swarens, through the support of a Society of Professional Journalists fellowship, spent more than a year investigating a lucrative business where children are abused with low risk to buyers or traffickers, despite tougher laws and heightened international awareness of the scourge. Google, Eli Lilly and Co., and Indiana Wesleyan University provided additional support for this project.</p>

<p>This is the fourth of 10 columns in the EXPLOITED series, which explores the cultural and economic forces that contribute to commercial sexual exploitation.</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO, Calif. — The silence nearly killed Tom Jones.</p>

<p>As a child, Jones was raped, abused and sold to men for sex. The brutality ended when he was 15. But, like many male victims, Jones didn’t seek help, didn’t tell anyone about the trauma he had suffered.</p>

<p>Instead, he buried his pain and shame deep inside, carrying the burden alone and in silence for another 15 years.</p>

<p>Silence did not equal acceptance. “I’m lucky, because I shouldn’t be here,” Jones says. “I put a lot of focus and energy into taking my own life.”</p>

<p>Two suicide attempts failed. And Jones says he was preparing for a third attempt when he decided finally to reach out for help.</p>

<p>More: How many people are victims of sex trafficking?</p>

<p>Even then, years after the exploitation ended, it was difficult for Jones to acknowledge what he had suffered. “I was very ashamed to talk to a therapist who I knew cared about me,” he says.</p>

<p>“Key informants pointed out their belief that law enforcement has very little understanding of (commercially exploited) boys. For example, when filing human trafficking reports, they would often ask: ‘Why couldn’t he get away? He’s a boy.’ One informant said she was forced to explain to law enforcement professionals before filing a report that boys and young men can be bought and sold just like girls.”</p>

<p>— “And Boys Too,” ECPAT-USA, 2013 report.</p>

<p>Tom Jones’ tortuous journey — from male child trafficking victim to adult survivor — is far more common than is often acknowledged by anti-trafficking organizations, law enforcement and the news media.</p>

<p>“Boys hear that it only happens to girls,” Steven Procopio, clinical director of MaleSurvivor, a network of therapists and survivors,says. “This is seen as a gender-biased, gender-specific issue.”</p>

<p>The United Nations’ International Labour Organization reinforced that mindset in September when it released updated estimates on the number of human trafficking victims worldwide. The ILO reported that of the 4.8 million people forced to work in the sex trade in 2016, virtually all were girls and women.</p>

<p>As I reported on this series, some nonprofit leaders involved in the fight against trafficking in the U.S. delivered the same message. Boys, they told me, are rarely the victims of commercial exploitation.</p>

<p>“It makes me very angry,” Jerome Elam, a male survivor who is CEO of the Trafficking in America Task Force, said. “The UN and others are not acknowledging the problem. They’re just not getting it in terms of the sex trafficking of males.”</p>

<p>Multiple studies support Elam and Procopio’s contention that boys are exploited far more often than is commonly understood.</p>

<p>In 2016, a Department of Justice-commissioned study, Youth Involvement in the Sex Trade, found that boys make up about 36% of children caught up in the U.S. sex industry (about 60% are female and less than 5% are transgender males and females).</p>

<p>In 2008, researchers from the John Jay School of Criminal Justice reported that boys account for about 45% of child trafficking victims in New York City.</p>

<p>In 2013, an ECPAT-USA report concluded that the “scope of (the commercial sexual exploitation of boys) is vastly under reported.” The researchers also cited the need to better identify male victims, to raise awareness about the harm caused by commercial exploitation and to provide more services designed specifically for boys.</p>

<p>But years later, little progress has been made either in identifying or providing help for male victims.</p>

<p>More: How do I report human trafficking?</p>

<p>The result is that tens of thousands of boys and men continue to suffer in silence. And like other victims of sexual abuse, they’re at greater risk of depression, suicide and chronic diseases. They’re more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. More likely to land in prison.</p>

<p>Relationships also suffer, with spouses and children frustrated and perplexed by their loved one’s bouts of depression, random anger and emotional numbness.</p>

<p>“They haven’t told even their families what they’ve been through,” Jones says.</p>

<p>“We were met with more resistance because we are helping boys. But we owe it to the world to see that boys are provided with the care they need.”</p>

<p>— Chris Smith, co-founder (with his wife, Anna) of Restore One, a North Carolina-based nonprofit providing treatment for trafficked boys.</p>

<p>Why do boys continue to be overlooked in efforts to combat trafficking? Male survivors and their advocates have strong opinions about the answers.</p>

<p>“We live in a culture where men are perpetrators and women are victims, and there are no gray areas,” Procopio of MaleSurvivor said. “There’s a lot sexism involved with this issue.”</p>

<p>Boys don’t fit the popular script of who is and isn’t a victim of trafficking. Liam Neeson didn’t bust through doors in the Taken movies to rescue his son. Journalists seldom write heartbreaking stories about 15-year-old boys sold on Backpage.</p>

<p>And even in 2018, Procopio notes, a dangerous myth persists that an adolescent boy who is exploited by an adult is somehow “lucky” to get the sex that every young male supposedly craves. In reality, male victims of commercial exploitation and sexual abuse suffer the same types of trauma as females. Their pain is just as devastating. There’s nothing lucky about it.</p>

<p>Elam points to another misconception that pushes boys into silence: The fear that the abused will become an abuser. Although it’s true that sexual abuse victims are at increased risk of harming others, a strong majority do not perpetuate the crime. Still, an unfair stigma that they pose a danger to children is often attached to male survivors.</p>

<p>All of which makes it harder for boys and men to break the silence.</p>

<p>“We’re not inclined to come out and say we were raped as children because we’re afraid we’ll be ridiculed,” Elam says.</p>

<p>The reluctance to speak up is understandable, but it carries damaging consequences. Victims feel even more isolated. Government agencies and nonprofits are reluctant to provide services for an invisible population. Police, teachers and others in regular contact with youth don’t receive training in how to identify and help male victims.</p>

<p>In many ways, it’s a repeat of how female victims were treated a decade ago. Although we still have far to go, we’ve thankfully come a long way in better identifying, assisting and accepting girls exploited in the sex trade. But we’re failing our boys.</p>

<p>Procopio and others say another form of bias — discrimination against gay and transgender males — also helps explain why boys aren’t acknowledged as victims and offered help. “There’s a lot of homophobia. But this issue is not about sexual orientation,” Procopio says. “Trafficking is about power and control.”</p>

<p>Gay and transgender youth are more likely to become trafficking victims, according to the Polaris Project, in part because family conflicts push many of them to run away from home. Once on the streets, runaway kids, no matter their gender or sexual orientation, are highly vulnerable to exploitation. Gay and transgender youth also are at significantly higher risk of physical violence than others working in the sex trade.</p>

<p>“When you wake up to it, when you see how big it is, I don’t know how you turn away.”</p>

<p>Tom Jones, sexual abuse survivor</p>

<p>Yet, according to the 2016 Youth in the Sex Trade study and other research, most male child trafficking victims aren’t gay. The majority are heterosexual boys manipulated or forced into having sex with men. As a consequence, Procopio notes, it’s common for straight male victims to question their sexual orientation long after the abuse ends.</p>

<p>In Southern California, Tom Jones, after surviving what he calls his era of silence, now pours his energy into reaching other men struggling with the aftermath of trafficking and abuse.</p>

<p>Jones leads a loose network of male survivors who are at various points on the path to healing. He encourages the men to enter counseling, but many aren’t ready for that step. In fact, he’s met only about a third of the network’s members face to face. Many of the survivors are not yet ready to engage in anything more threatening than sending and receiving text messages.</p>

<p>One man, despite years of interaction with Jones, won’t acknowledge that he suffered the abuse he describes. “He says it happened to a friend,” Jones says.</p>

<p>For many victims, the shame and guilt are still buried too deep to speak the truth, to shatter the silence that holds so many men as emotional prisoners.</p>

<p>But Jones, Elam and others keep speaking out on victims’ behalf, keeps shouting the message that boys are exploited in the sex trade far more often than many want to admit.</p>

<p>“When you wake up to it, when you see how big it is,” Jones says, “I don’t know how you turn away.”</p>

<h2 id="elimanningodellbeckhamjrstarindirtydancingsuperbowladfornfl">Eli Manning, Odell Beckham Jr. star in 'Dirty Dancing' Super Bowl ad for NFL</h2>

<p id="link">url: https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/Ad-Meter/2018/02/04/eli-manning-odell-beckham-jr-dirty-dancing-nfl-ad-super-bowl/305341002/ </p>

<p>Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. star in this ad for the NFL.</p>

<p>Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr. danced at the Super Bowl. And it looked like they were having the time of their lives.</p>

<p>The New York Giants stars two-stepped their way through the NFL’s Super Bowl ad in a spot-on parody of the Patrick Swayze-Jennifer Grey dance scene from the 1987 movie Dirty Dancing.</p>

<p>The commercial — set to the song (I’ve Had) The Time of My Life — was filmed in one day a couple of weeks ago at the Giants practice facility, according to Jaime Weston, NFL senior vice president of marketing. The ad finished a close second to Amazon’s “Alexa Lost her Voice” in USA TODAY’s 30th Ad Meter, presented by Kia, a ranking of ads based on consumer rankings.</p>

<p>“When the guys got there in the morning they got to work with the choreographer,” Weston says. “We were so lucky to have Stephanie Klemons, the choreographer on Hamilton. They came in, they were serious and they got to work learning their moves. While the shoot was being set up, they were on the other side of the field learning their steps.”</p>

<p>The NFL used to penalize touchdown celebrations. Now it choreographs them.</p>

<p>“We received a handful of concepts” from Grey, the ad agency, Weston says, “but when this one came in we said, ‘This is it.’”</p>

<p>Giants offensive linemen Brett Jones, John Greco, Chad Wheeler, D.J. Fluker and John Jerry joined in as backup dancers. Safety Landon Collins, on the sideline, got off a memorable line from the movie: “Let them dance.”</p>

<p>More: </p>

<p>All the Super Bowl 2018 ads from the first half in the order they were released</p>

<p>All the Super Bowl 2018 ads from the second half in the order they were released</p>

<p>“Just a little nod there, we thought, was perfect,” Weston says.</p>

<p>“That was actually my pick as the best spot of the Super Bowl,” says Shawn McBride, executive vice president, sports, for Ketchum Sports &amp; Entertainment. “The first thought that went through my mind was: ‘This ad is positioning Eli as the heir to Peyton’s title as MVP — most valuable pitchman — of the NFL.’”</p>

<p>MIDWEST CITY, Okla. — A 17-year-old Oklahoma high school student is facing obscenity and child pornography charges after authorities say he posted nude photos of students on a Snapchat page then tried to blackmail administrators when they turned off the school’s Wi-Fi access.</p>

<p>Midwest City Police Chief Brandon Clabes says the Carl Albert High School student faces 10 charges, including blackmail and transmitting obscenity and child pornography.</p>

<p>Clabes says the teen posted nude and provocative photos of students from a Snapchat account. Clabes says when the school switched off its Wi-Fi, the student threatened to post more photos if it wasn’t turned back on.</p>

<p>Clabes says investigators were able to identify the student after he sent another batch of photos last week.</p>

<p>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. — Taha Muntajibuddin remembers a third-grade classmate in Fort Worth, Texas, whose appearance drew relentless mockery and bullying from her fellow students, who nicknamed her "cootie kid."</p>

<p>The girl, one of the oldest siblings in the large Turpin family, wore the same filthy purple dress every day and had her hair tied back with a discarded foil wrapper from an old Hershey's bar, Mutajibuddin recalled. No one wanted to be near her because she smelled like mud and worse.</p>

<p>Last week, Mutajibuddin, who went to school with the girl years ago, wrote in a wrenching Facebook post that he got a "rude awakening" when he read the news accounts of the familial horror created by the girl's parents, David and Louise Turpin. The couple is accused of imprisoning, starving and torturing 12 of their children, half of them now adults ranging in age up to 29, at their home Perris home.</p>

<p>Muntajibuddin, a physician completing a residency in pediatric medicine in Houston, said he felt an "overwhelming sense of guilt and shame" about his former classmate, whom he remembers being tossed about "like a rag doll" by school bullies.</p>

<p>"Of course, none of us are responsible for the events that ensued, but you can't help but feel rotten when the classmate your peers made fun of for 'smelling like poop' quite literally had to sit in her own waste because she was chained to her bed," he wrote. "It is nothing but sobering to know that the person who sat across from you at the lunch table went home to squalor and filth while you went home to a warm meal and a bedtime story."</p>

<p>David and Louise Turpin were arrested on Sunday after Riverside County sheriff deputies found siblings malnourished in their Perris, Calif. home, Tuesday, January 16, 2018.</p>

<p>He said the girl was often made fun of constantly "because her clothes would sometimes look as though they had been dragged through mud, which she would also smell like on most days. I distinctly remember my entire third grade class scoffing at her one day because our teacher had asked her to discard a scrunchy she had used to tie her hair out of a discarded tin foil wrapper from an old Hershey's bar."</p>

<p>After that year, Muntajibuddin said, the girl moved away and "she was forgotten about after we moved on to the the next 'cootie kid.'"</p>

<p>Years later, while in medical school, Muntajibudden found himself searching social media for any trace of the Turpin girl, thinking that "somewhere, somehow, (she) was probably living her best life, showing up all of us gawky third-graders ... She was going to be that person at the reunion looking completely flawless and making six figures while the rest of us tried to conceal our receding hair lines and minimum wage jobs."</p>

<p>He added: "I feel like we all kind of have that hope that those people who were marginalized growing up (sometimes by our own hands) somehow grew past those circumstances, and essentially grew up to kick ass in real life. That's what I had hoped for (the girl). That she had used the insults that we hurled at her, the isolation we provided for her, and the ill-looks we gave her and used it as ammunition to forge a successful path in life."</p>

<p>But that's not what happened.</p>

<p>Muntajibuddin says he's read numerous articles on the case with disturbing details provided by authorities — like how the siblings were only allowed to shower once a year, were punished for as little as getting their wrists wet while washing hands and were barely being fed while their parents ate in front of them.</p>

<p>Looking back, Muntajibuddin says there should have been more than a phone call to police.</p>

<p>He wrote: "The resounding lesson here is a simple one, something that we're taught from the very beginning: be nice. Teach your children to be nice. If you see someone that's isolated, befriend them. If you see someone that's marginalized, befriend them. If you see someone that's different, befriend them. We can never completely put ourselves in others' shoes nor can we completely understand the circumstances that one is brought up in, but a simple act of kindness and acceptance may be the ray of hope that that person needs."</p>

<p>A Polish-born doctor in Michigan who has lived in the U.S. since he was 5 years old could face deportation due to two misdemeanors committed more than quarter century ago, his family says.</p>

<p>Lukasz Niec, 43, is an internist in Kalamazoo who has been a permanent resident since 1989. He was taken into custody at his home Jan. 16 by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, family members told the local WOOD-TV.</p>

<p>The "notice to appear" stems from two misdemeanors from 26 years ago — malicious destruction of property under $100 in January 1992, and a few months later receiving and concealing stolen property over $100. Niec was 17 at the time, and the youthful offender proceeding allowed young first offenders to avoid a criminal record if they stayed out of trouble.</p>

<p>But ICE is a federal agency, and family members complained that Niec did not know that the agency was not bound to honor the agreement, the family says.</p>

<p>“These misdemeanors were just an adolescent making mistakes and learning from them,” Niec's sister, Iwona Niec-Villaire, told WOOD-TV.</p>

<p>There have been other issues, however. The Michigan news website MLive reports that Niec pleaded guilty to a 2008 operating impaired by liquor offense in Kalamazoo County. As part of the plea agreement, the plea was withdrawn and the case dismissed after he completed probation. In 2013, a jury found him not guilty on a domestic violence charge.</p>

<p>Disposition of Niec's case could take months, and his family fears the worst. Niec's wife, Rachelle Burkart-Niec, stands behind her husband.</p>

<p>“He’s an excellent physician, he’s loving, he’s caring, he’s an honorable husband and he’s always helping others,” she told WOOD-TV.</p>

<p>Niec's sister said her brother doesn't even speak Polish.</p>

<p>“He cannot go back to Poland, a country he doesn’t know, he has no family at, both our parents passed away in the United States, he doesn’t know anyone, he wouldn’t know where to go,” Niec-Villaire said.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/01/04/use-computer-smartphone-new-broad-security-flaw-means-you-need-do-now/1004400001/ </p>

<p>Apple is to issue a fix for its products impacted by the ‘Spectre’ chip flaw, after major chipmakers disclosed flaws that leave nearly every modern computing device vulnerable to hackers. Newslook</p>

<p>SAN FRANCISCO — Apple says all of its Macs, iPhones and iPads contain a security flaw that requires an update. It's not alone. Any owner of a PC, tablet or smart phone should make sure that automatic software updates for their operating systems are enabled after security researchers this week revealed a broad flaw in Intel and other chips that could allow hackers to access data previously thought to be secure.</p>

<p>What you should do about it?</p>

<p>Every major software company has been pushing out updates to fix the problem. Make sure you allow your computers and phones to automatically install software updates and patches as they are released. These will likely be modified as companies craft the best work-arounds, so it’s not likely to be a one-time deal — update early and often!</p>

<p>Those on Microsoft products will needs to first determine which version of the Windows operating system they are running, then run a query on the Microsoft support site asking "update Windows" along with the version they're running.</p>

<p>Apple products will automatically update themselves, or at least prompt users to update them.</p>

<p>Google Chromebooks self update. Many, but not all, phones running the Android operating system also do, or will ask if the user wants their operating system updated. You can also go to the settings app on the phone, tap About Device and then tap System Updates to see if an update is available.</p>

<p>More: Intel chip design flaw that could let hackers access passwords prompts industrywide updates</p>

<p>Many security companies are suggesting users also make sure their security software is up to date. As soon as hackers create code to use this new flaw, security software will help flag and possibly stop them.</p>

<p>What products are affected?</p>

<p>Potentially everything that's got a central processing unit or CPU, which means PCs, Macs, laptops, smart phones and tablets. But patches are coming fast and furious.</p>

<p>Microsoft has already pushed out a patch for Windows 10 and other Windows versions will be updated on Tuesday, January 9. If you have auto updates enabled, you should get this upgrade.</p>

<p>Apple on Thursday said that it has already released patches in iOS 11.2, macOS 10.13.2, and tvOS 11.2 to help defend against Meltdown, and that Apple Watch is not affected by Meltdown. The upgrades come via auto updates.</p>

<p>The company plans to release mitigations in Safari to help defend against Spectre "in the coming days," it said in a blog. The company also said it will continue to develop and test further patches for future updates of its operating system.</p>

<p>Google has published a list of all its devices and software that might need updates and what users have to do to install them, though many (like Chromebooks) will self install.</p>

<p>Amazon’s AWS cloud computing service expected all its computing systems to be patched by the end of the day Wednesday. Customers were also told to patch their operating systems to be fully secured.</p>

<p>What chips are affected?</p>

<p>(Photo: Getty Images)</p>

<p>Intel, which makes most of the chips used in PCs, is the most heavily affected. It said Thursday it has already issued updates for the majority of CPUs — the chips that handle the instructions a computer receives from hardware and software, sometimes known as the "brain" of the computer — introduced within the past five years. By the end of next week it expects to have issued updates for more than 90% of processors introduced within the past five years.</p>

<p>Chip-maker Advanced Micro Devices, whose products are mostly used in corporate server computers and personal computers, originally said it didn’t believe its products were at risk for the flaw. It has since updated that to say that one of the potential attacks could be used on some of its chips. It encouraged its customers to use safe computing practices, including “not clicking on unrecognized hyperlinks, following strong password protocols, using secure networks, and accepting regular software updates.”</p>

<p>ARM, whose chips are primarily used in smart phones and electronic devices such as e-readers, televisions, cable boxes and cars, said that only a small subset of its chips were vulnerable and listed them on its website. It has also published a technical paper outlining how the flaws can be mitigated.</p>

<p>How did this happen?</p>

<p>There are actually two exploitable flaws, though they’re related. They have been given the James Bond-esque names Meltdown and Spectre. Both use what’s known as a side-channel analysis attack. Basically, malicious code can be written that allows an attacker to see information stored in what was previously believed to be a secure portion of a computer’s central processing unit, or CPU.</p>

<p>What's the problem that makes this possible?</p>

<p>(Photo: Intel)</p>

<p>It’s something no one had realized was an issue for 20-some years. Back in the early 1990s, in an effort to speed up computer processing, computer chip engineers hit on the idea of letting computers guess at what data would be needed next. It was called “speculative execution.” It’s something like a salesperson who sees a man pick out a pair of slacks in a store and so grabs a belt and a jacket that match because they might be what he looks for next.</p>

<p>In the computer, it could be that you go to the banking section of your password management program. The speculative execution function then pulls all your banking passwords into the protected memory portion of the CPU because it’s making a good guess you’ll ask for that next.</p>

<p>Meltdown allows full access to the protected memory space, so it’s potentially more dangerous. It appears to only affect Intel chips manufactured since 1995.</p>

<p>Spectre allows malicious code to trick access random portions of the protected memory. It is believed to affect processors made by Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and ARM.</p>

<p>The real issue is that the flaws allow cyber criminals a new set of tools to steal passwords and other critical data.</p>

<p>“The scope impacts a large set of the computing devices that we rely on, from PC to phones and back-end services consumers rely upon, such as servers and the cloud,” said McAfee chief technology officer Steve Grobman.</p>

<p>How much could the hackers see?</p>

<p>The exploit could allow an attacker to open a window that let's them look at what’s being rolled into and out of that protected memory space, says Atiq Raza, chairman and CEO of Virsec Systems, Inc and the former president of AMD. Depending how long the hackers can keep the window open “they could see a very significant amount of data scroll by. Even if it's just for a few seconds, a humongous amount of information could go through,” he said.</p>

<p>(Photo: NVIDIA)</p>

<p>How did this exist for so long?</p>

<p>An excellent question, which hasn't been answered yet.</p>

<p>The flaws were discovered over the last several months independently by several teams, including Google’s Project Zero security team, researchers at Graz University of Technology in Austria, the University of Adelaide in Australia and the universities of Pennsylvania and Maryland, along with researchers at security firms Cyberus Technology, Rambus and Data61.</p>

<p>The researchers alerted chip and software companies, which began writing patches and fixes. Everything was supposed to be announced on January 9th.</p>

<p>As companies started to make changes to their software to allow them to implement the patches, security researchers noticed something was going on. This created buzz in the broader computer security community. When the security news site The Register published a story on January 2, it became impossible to wait and Intel and Google went public with the information.</p>

<p>(Photo: Getty Images)</p>

<p>Has anyone actually made use of this exploit yet?</p>

<p>Not that we know of. It’s a very complex and rarified attack and one that until a few months ago no one even realized was possible. That said, exploiting this bug wouldn't leave traces so it's difficult to know if it's being used "in the wild," as security researchers say.</p>

<p>But the race is now on, says Tony Cole, vice president of global government and critical infrastructure with computer security company FireEye. “I’m sure everybody on the attacker side is busy reading everything that’s out and trying to figure out how to use this. It’s being worked on as we speak.”</p>

<h2 id="millennialsstriveforperfectionismmorethanpastgenerationsstudysays">Millennials strive for perfectionism more than past generations, study says</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Sean Rossman</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-03</p>

<p id="link">url: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/01/04/millennials-strive-perfectionism-more-than-past-generations/1002933001/ </p>

<p>College students today strive for perfection more than previous generations and it could be damaging to their mental health.</p>

<p>That's what two British researchers found in an analysis of nearly 42,000 college students from the United States, Canada and Britain, what they believe is the first study of the generational differences in perfectionism.</p>

<p>Lead author Thomas Curran of the University of Bath and co-author Andrew Hill of York St. John University describe perfectionism as "an irrational desire to achieve along with being overly critical of oneself and others.” In their study, published Dec. 28 in the journal Psychological Bulletin, college students from 1989 to 2016 took a test to measure self-oriented, other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism.</p>

<p>Modern-day students, the study found, display more characteristics of three types of perfectionism. The most drastic increase was attributed to perceived social expectations.</p>

<p>Read more: Youth suicide rates are rising. School and the Internet may be to blame.</p>

<p>The more recent students scored higher in all three forms of perfectionism. Between 1989 and 2016, the scores for socially prescribed perfectionism — or perceiving the excessive expectations of others— increased by 33%. Other-oriented expectations — putting unrealistic expectations on others — went up 16%, and self-oriented perfectionism — our irrational desire to be perfect — increased 10%.</p>

<p>“These findings suggest that recent generations of college students have higher expectations of themselves and others than previous generations,” Curran said. “Today’s young people are competing with each other in order to meet societal pressures to succeed and they feel that perfectionism is necessary in order to feel safe, socially connected and of worth.”</p>

<p>Curran expounded on the reasons for the rise in perfectionism, suggesting social media can drive perfectionism by causing young people to compare themselves to others, which might cause dissatisfaction with their bodies and social isolation. He said this theory has not been tested.</p>

<p>The perfectionism problem, Curran suggests, might be taking its toll on students' mental health. The study states increases in psychological difficulties such as depression and anxiety can be linked to perfectionism, which is a "core vulnerability to a variety of disorders, symptoms, and syndromes."</p>

<p>In recent years, American college students seeking mental health treatment increased. From 2009 to 2015, the average number of students seeking mental health treatment surged about 30%, far outpacing the increase in enrollment (5.6%), according to the Center for Collegiate Mental Health at Penn State University.</p>

<p>Drinking alcohol is a part of many of our lives no matter where you live. But alcohol abuse can take its toll on not only your health, but the economy as well. Buzz60</p>

<p>(Photo: monkeybusinessimages, Getty Images/iStockphoto)</p>

<p>'Tis the season to pass the bubbly and cheers to a spirited new year for many Americans. But, what if you keep up the habit beyond the holidays? How many drinks are safe throughout the week?</p>

<p>Women should have no more than one drink per day and men no more than two, according to Dietary Guidelines for Americans. This isn't necessarily a weekly recommendation of 7 to 14 drinks. Also, Dietary Guidelines doesn't recommend anyone who doesn't drink should start drinking.</p>

<p>Based on per capita consumption from alcoholic beverage sales data, the average American drinks roughly 1.35 drinks per day, 9.5 drinks per week and 494 drinks per year, said Aaron White, senior scientific advisor to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism director. But, White said that number is higher — 1.94 drinks a day, 13.6 per week and 705 a year when adjusting for age (looking at just adults 18 and older, the majority of the nation's drinkers).</p>

<p>More: Alcohol abuse: The drunkest city in every state</p>

<p>More: America’s 25 thriving industries include goat farming, breweries</p>

<p>Stuart Gitlow, past president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, said anyone with a family history of alcoholism or past problems with addiction shouldn’t have any alcoholic drinks.</p>

<p>For others, he said any dose isn’t really good for you, but there are safer amounts.</p>

<p>“An amount sufficient to feel it is not something you want to do on a daily basis," Gitlow said. "Once a week is probably fine, but more than that you are starting to get to a point where you are increasing your risks. The smaller the amount of alcohol, the smaller the risks.”</p>

<p>The American Society of Clinical Oncology, made up some of the nation's top cancer doctors, has said limiting alcoholic drinks is important for cancer prevention. The American Cancer Institute for Cancer Research links drinking to an increased risk of a host of cancers, including breast cancer. While even moderate amounts of alcohol can increase cancer risk, the Institute says moderate alcohol — no more than one drink a day for women and two for men — could protect against coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Nearly half of liver disease deaths involve alcohol, according to 2015 data from the NIAAA.</p>

<p>Alcohol use causes about 88,000 deaths annually, the NIAAA notes, making it the third leading preventable cause of death in the U.S.</p>

<h2 id="whoisdougjonescivilrightsactivistattorneyanduniversityofalabamaalum">Who is Doug Jones? Civil Rights activist, attorney and University of Alabama alum</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Brian Lyman</p>

<p>USA Today’s Paul Singer analyzes how Doug Jones scored the first Senate win for an Alabama Democrat in 25 years against scandal-ridden Roy Moore. Walbert Castillo, Jack Gruber</p>

<p>MONTGOMERY — Doug Jones special election victory over Roy Moore marks the first time Alabama has elected a Democrat to the Senate in 25 years. </p>

<p>But who is Jones?</p>

<p>Here's a primer on the newly elected Democratic Senator:</p>

<p>University of Alabama alum </p>

<p>One day in 1973, Doug Jones was in a cotton tie mill in Fairfield's steel works, where red-bithot steel billets 10 feet long would “go through this press that would reduce it down to metal that would be real thin metal that would tie up bales of cotton,”Jones had just finished his first year at the University of Alabama. His grades, he recalled in a recent interview, “weren’t that great” and his father, a longtime company veteran, decided his son “needed some incentive to work harder.”</p>

<p>Alabama senator-elect Doug Jones says his victory over GOP Roy Moore in Tuesday's special election marks a moment for national unity. Jones said he is "overwhelmed" by his win over Moore, who did not concede and talked about a recount. (Dec. 13) AP</p>

<p>So Jones worked six days a week, 10 hours a day at the mill, performing different jobs. On this day, the teenager helped collect scrap metal to go into a machine known as a scrap baller, which turned the excess into balls for salvage. As Jones and a co-worker fed the machine, it got stuck.</p>

<p>“You’ve got these big old hooks you’re supposed to use,” Jones said in a recent interview. “Well, the other old guy who was using it was not using the hook, so I didn’t use the hook either. I yanked on that big old ball of scrap when I did, and a piece of metal sprung up and hit me right between the eyes.”</p>

<p>Jones got away with a bleeding wound. It could have been worse.</p>

<p>“If it had been left or right in any eye, I know I would have lost an eye and it would have done serious damage and probably killed me,” he said. “It hit in the right spot, because I’m hard-headed as hell anyway.”</p>

<p>Jones graduated from the University of Alabama in 1976; his accident in the steel mill, he said, spurred him to improve his grades. At Alabama, he served in the Student Senate and as president of the Off-Campus Association; he also worked in the office of then-Lt. Gov. Jere Beasley. He later attended the Cumberland School of Law, stealing away from his classes in 1977 to watch then-Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley wage his successful prosecution of Bob Chambliss for the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in 1963.</p>

<p>Growing up in a steel town amid segregation </p>

<p>U.S. Steel established Fairfield, Ala., as a company town in the early 1910s. When Jones was born in 1954, the city was near its peak population, and the mills were woven into the landscape, from the sulphuric smell of the blast furnace to fires that lit up the sky.</p>

<p>“I can remember times as a kid where we knew, because of dad’s work and my grandfather’s, that the Ensley Works were going to be pouring one night, and it would light up the night sky,” Jones said. “People used to just go and get on the viaduct in Ensley and just watch the magnificence of that.”</p>

<p>But if it was a friendly neighborhood, there was also segregation. Jones did not attend classes with black students until he was in the seventh grade. Integration was difficult. Jones’ parents sent him to Bessemer High School for a time — but eventually, the white and black high schools in the area consolidated at Fairfield High School in 1969. Jones said “the kids adjusted very well” but added that there were “dust-ups.”</p>

<p>Gardner, one of the first blacks to attend Fairfield, recalled difficulties, including one white student sticking a spitball in his hair. But he said Jones tried to keep things calm.</p>

<p>“Whatever was about to happen, he was there to put it out,” he said. “Doug was always that person who saw both sides and wanted to help move things.”</p>

<p>After graduating the Cumberland School of Law in 1979, Doug Jones worked for a year as a staffer for Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.</p>

<p>(Photo: Doug Jones for Senate)</p>

<p>Jones said he remembered the school reinstating a “Miss Fairfield’ pageant in his senior year, which he emceed “in this godawful velvet tuxedo.” A young black freshman won the competition. Jones said that caused “happiness and thrills” on one side and “a lot of angst and frustration and anger with the white kids.” One student approached Jones and said their concerns stemmed from the fact she was a freshman.</p>

<p>“I called him out on that,” Jones said. “I said, ‘Come on, that’s just crap. You know that and I know that. This is about race. And we’ve got to get over that.’”</p>

<p>Attorney</p>

<p>“Doug is like a bulldog sometimes,” said Mike Coppage, a retired chief of the Birmingham Police Department who worked with Jones on the investigation of an abortion clinic bombing in 1998 that killed an off-duty police officer. “He sees what’s right, he knows what’s right and he’s going to do it.”</p>

<p>That tenacity from Fairfield to careers as both a sought-after criminal defense attorney and a U.S. Attorney who led successful prosecutions of Thomas Blanton and Frank Cherry for the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, which killed four little girls. Rick Bragg, a writer and journalist who later befriended Jones, said Jones worked like a “drumbeat” in the 2002 Cherry trial.</p>

<p>“It was methodical,” he said in a phone interview. “There weren’t any surprises lurking. He just looked like he was in control of the situation.”</p>

<p>It’s also led him to a campaign for U.S. Senate that, by any measure, will be an uphill climb for a Democrat in deep-red Alabama. Jones is hoping voters respond to his life story, which touches on many aspects of Alabama’s history — including its industrial heritage, which gave Jones and many other Alabamians a start in the middle class.</p>

<p>U.S. Attorney and bombing of women's clinic </p>

<p>Jones felt “he would have a good shot” of returning to the U.S. Attorney’s office when Bill Clinton won the 1992 presidential election. Still, Jones was hesitant at first: The Democrats had a rough midterm in 1994, and it wasn’t clear Clinton might win re-election. Jones knew to take the job, he would “have to shut down a law practice, and I didn’t want to do that for just a few months or a year.”</p>

<p>But after Clinton’s re-election in 1996 — and another candidate deciding to bow out for personal reasons – Jones got the nomination and the confirmation in 1997.</p>

<p>Joyce White Vance, who worked with Jones in the late '90s and served as U.S. Attorney in Birmingham from 2009 until earlier this year, said the head of the office always has a full plate.</p>

<p>“Every day you go to work as a U.S. Attorney, you have a long list of tasks you want to accomplish, and most of them get shoved aside by the contingencies of the day,” she said.</p>

<p>Jones said he felt his earlier work as a defense attorney helped him as a U.S. Attorney.</p>

<p>"It really helps you understand the entire system – that everyone has a role, and everyone has to talk to each other," he said.</p>

<p>Clips from Jones’ time show the U.S. Attorney’s Office pursuing embezzlement and fraud cases, including one out of Winston County that involved the purchase of absentee ballots with cash, beer, and liquor. During that time, Jones worked with then-Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor, a Republican who is now a U.S. Circuit Court Judge.</p>

<p>Jones said early on he was “very candid” with Pryor about issues he had with joint federal and state investigations that targeted his clients when he was a defense attorney. But Jones said he and Pryor worked well together.</p>

<p>“We were so compatible in our goals in the criminal justice arena that we had some very good working relationships on some cases,” he said.</p>

<p>On Jan. 29, 1998, Jones got a call about an explosion at the New Woman, All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham. He arrived in time to see a nurse injured in the bombing loaded into an ambulance. Very soon he saw the body of 35-year-old police officer Robert Sanderson, killed in the blast.</p>

<p>“It just seizes you by the throat to witness that,” Jones said. “And I said, ‘Oh my God, what can we do for him.’ ” Jones took a step toward the clinic. An FBI agent stopped him, telling him there could be a secondary device in the area.</p>

<p>As reporters gathered on the scene, the law enforcement agencies involved gathered in a Baptist student union nearby. Coppage said Jones took charge.</p>

<p>“He took ownership,” he said. “He said ‘This is affecting our city and our community. We’re going to make sure we work this thing through the end.’”</p>

<p>The Birmingham Police Department had a “tremendous evidence collection unit,” said Coppage. The investigators also got an assist from the Bureau of Alchohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), whose bomb response unit happened to be training in Atlanta the day of the bombing. “They came in and worked hand-in-hand with our folks,” Coppage said.</p>

<p>The former chief said the agencies worked together “seamlessly” on the case. ATF's ability to reconstruct the bomb within a few weeks impressed Jones. Coppage said Jones made sure Birmingham Police were at the table with federal agencies pursuing the case, due to the death of one of their own.</p>

<p>“He understood where we were coming from during clinic bombing,” he said. “He was very respectful, very thoughtful of our opinions.”</p>

<p>Investigators benefited from key breaks early. A UAB student who heard the blast on the morning of the 29th saw a suspect running from the scene and went to follow him. Later joined by an attorney, the two ended up identifying the suspect — who would turn out to be Eric Rudolph — and getting his license plate numbers. “Without that young man and that lawyer, Rudolph would have killed again,” Jones said.</p>

<p>Jones got an indictment against Rudolph, but never the chance to try him in court. “I was so hoping by the time I left office that we would have at least captured him,” Jones said. “That didn’t happen. He was on the run for five years.”</p>

<p>Law enforcement captured Rudolph in 2003 and pleaded guilty to the bombing of the clinic and an Atlanta club in 1998. When he came to Birmingham in 2005, Jones made sure clinic staff and Birmingham Police were on the front row.</p>

<p>“We did justice to our officer and justice to our community,” Coppage said. “It was surreal. It was over after all that work.”</p>

<p>While Bill Baxley managed in 1977 to convict Bob Chambliss for his role in the bombing of the 16th Street Baptist church, law enforcement for years had suspected others of involvement. A 1965 FBI memo had identified Blanton, Cherry and Herman Cash (who died in 1994) as possible co-conspirators in the case.</p>

<p>“The church was well aware, as the families were, that there were others out there somewhere,” said Rev. Chris Hamlin, who pastored 16th Street Baptist Church in the late 1990s. “Cherry and Blanton — those were very common names.”</p>

<p>The wheels for the next round of convictions began moving in 1993 when black clergy in Birmingham met with the FBI, and the case reopened. Jones took over the case when he became U.S. Attorney four years later.</p>

<p>“The community deserved an answer if we could provide it,” he said. “But at very least, they deserve a real look and an investigation to get to the bottom of it.”</p>

<p>Hamlin also wanted to be certain that prosecutors could actually put the suspects in prison.</p>

<p>“My concern was, ‘Don’t reopen the case if they were not certain they could get the conviction,’” he said. “I didn’t think it was fair to take the families through that.”</p>

<p>It was a formidable undertaking.</p>

<p>“The evidence was old, many witnesses were deceased or had faded memories, and physical evidence had to be located,” Vance said. “It was a dogged determination to track down every piece of evidence where it might be.” Coppage recalled "digging through the basement" of the police department's headquarters to find evidence.</p>

<p>The team had some breaks that previous investigators didn’t. Family members turned on Frank Cherry. Several spoke before the grand jury investigating the case. When his granddaughter spoke to the grand jury in 1999, Cherry told The Associated Press that she was a “dope head” and a “prostitute.”</p>

<p>“Cherry used to run his mouth a lot,” Jones said. “Sometimes when you think you’ve gotten away with murder, you run your mouth a lot. He did that with several people. A number of those folks came forward.”</p>

<p>Thomas Blanton, Jones said, “was not as talkative,” but investigators had a break: A cardboard box in an FBI evidence room contained recording obtained from a bug planted in Blanton’s apartment in June of 1964, where he told his wife he had missed a date with her because “we were making the bomb.” (Baxley said in 2002 he was never told of the existence of the tape when he built his case against Chambliss.) Another witness, who had been working on protecting buildings and who saw Chambliss, Blanton and Cherry and others scoping out the church two weeks before the bombing, also agreed to testify.</p>

<p>Securing the tape into evidence required jumping through “a bunch of hoops,” but prosecutors managed to get it into court, in part thanks to arguments Pryor made before the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>

<p>Blanton went on trial first, in 2001. The proceedings took place in state court, but Jones was able to lead the prosecution. John Cross, the pastor of 16th Street Baptist, told the court about finding the girls’ bodies “all stacked on top of each other, clung together.” A former girlfriend of Blanton’s said he tried to run down a black pedestrian, saying after “All I want is a chance to kill one of those black bastards.” The audio from the tape was played, which included a statement from Blanton that “They ain’t going to catch me when I bomb my next church.”</p>

<p>Blanton’s attorneys challenged the fidelity of the audio and said Blanton never explicitly said he bombed the church. In his closing arguments, Jones’ team flashed images of the girls killed in the bombing and the scene of the church.</p>

<p>“Tom Blanton saw change and didn’t like it,” Jones told the jury.</p>

<p>The jury took two and a half hours to convict Blanton.</p>

<p>“Doug’s style is grounded in competence,” Vance said. “He is a really good storyteller, in the sense he has a remarkable grasp of the facts and law.”</p>

<p>Blanton was sentenced to life in prison. He remains incarcerated at St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville.</p>

<p>In 2002, Cherry stood trial. Cherry had initially pleaded health issues in trying to avoid trial and claimed that he didn’t learn of the bombing until after. But Cherry faced testimony from family members, including an ex-wife, who testified he “got out of the car and put the bomb under the stairs (of the church) the night before.”</p>

<p>Bragg, who covered the trial for the The New York Times, said Jones “painted a picture” for the jury of the girls getting ready for services at the church.</p>

<p>“That could be because he’s a real smart lawyer, but if you watched him through the course of the trial, you could see he took this personally,” he said. “This was something that offended him.”</p>

<p>Jones said he “felt very, very strongly that those children and those families deserved to have a day in court.”</p>

<p>“That case had such an impact on the community where I grew up,” he said. “It was always a stain. The firehoses and dogs were always a stain. But when four children die in a bomb blast on a Sunday morning in a house of God, it’s hard to erase that stain.”</p>

<p>After six hours of deliberation, the jury convicted Cherry, who, like Blanton, got a sentence of life in prison. Cherry died at Kilby Correctional Facility in 2004.</p>

<p>The convictions, Hamlin said, “sent a powerful signal to other who committed hate crimes against the movement.”</p>

<p>After the trial, Jones would speak about the case around the country.</p>

<p>“I truly underestimated how important those cases were to a lot of people, not just in Alabama but all over America, for people who thought they would never see that justice for those families, or see a white southerner do it,” he said. “It truly makes you appreciate the value of every man, woman, and child in this country regardless of their race, religion or sexual orientation. The worth of people comes into focus.”</p>

<p>'He baits his own hook'</p>

<p>Jones briefly pursued a run for U.S. Senate in 2002 but dropped out due to fundraising issues. He trails Republican nominee Roy Moore, a former Alabama chief justice, in most early polls, but to this point has held his own in fundraising. Vance – whose husband Robert ran a tight race against Moore for chief justice in 2012 -- said Jones is focused on a “ vision of Alabama where there is opportunity for everyone.”</p>

<p>“Everybody in Alabama politics knows what the demographics say,” she said. “There’s no doubt this is going to be a tough, tough race.”</p>

<p>In his spare time, Jones enjoys fishing and hunting, particularly deer hunting, saying there is “nothing like getting out in the quiet of the early afternoon and waiting for the right one to come out.”</p>

<p>“He baits his own hook,” Bragg said. “He’s not afraid to get his hands dirty and he’s not afraid to get a little sunburn.”</p>

<p>Jones and his wife Louise are also active at Canterbury United Methodist Church in Mountain Brook, where they take part in Bible studies, including housing rehabilitation. Rev. Bill Morgan, a former pastor of the church, said “they were just people you could count on.”</p>

<p>“All his life, he’s just been part of his church,” he said. “In my observation, he just sees the natural connection between how you connect your faith with how you lead your life.”</p>

<p>Jones also has a baseball memorabilia collection, with signed balls from Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio as well as come from presidents Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush.</p>

<p>“He’s a real southern guy,” Bragg said. “I think he proves you can be thoughtful and smart as hell and still know which end of the shotgun to hold.”</p>

<p>President Trump signed two proclamations on Monday, formally scaling back two sprawling national monuments in Utah: Bears Ears and Grand-Staircase Escalante. Trump traveled to Salt Lake City on to make the announcement and sign the declaration. (Dec. 4) AP</p>

<p>ST. GEORGE, Utah — President Trump signed an executive order Monday cutting millions of acres out of Utah's two largest national monuments and attempting to settle scores on more than 20 years worth of battles over how to protect the state's vast public lands.</p>

<p>The order, signed after a brief speech made from Salt Lake City, cuts some 2 million acres from the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante monuments, splitting them into five smaller pieces and fulfilling a promise made to the state's all-Republican congressional delegation to overturn monument designations made by Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.</p>

<p>A 'monumental mistake'</p>

<p>For the tribal leaders of Native American tribes who live in the area, the move was seen as an affront to their sovereignty, and members of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, a group of five Native American tribes that lobbied for the Bears Ears monument, have vowed to challenge the new order in court.</p>

<p>“More than 150 years ago, the federal government removed our ancestors from Bears Ears at gunpoint and sent them on the ‘Long Walk,’ but we came back,” said Davis Filfred, a Navajo Nation council delegate, in a written statement. “The president’s proposal is an attack on tribes and will be remembered as equally disgraceful — but once again we’ll be back. We know how to persist; we know how to fight; and we will fight to defend Bears Ears.”</p>

<p>Various organizations have vowed to fight any proposed changes to the monuments, citing legal questions about whether Trump actually has the authority to overturn monument designations made by his predecessors.</p>

<p>“Today’s illegal proclamations by President Trump represent the single greatest attack a president has ever launched against America’s federal public lands," said Scott Groene, executive director of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. "It is certain that the legacies of both (Trump) and (Hatch), who goaded him into this despicable act, will be forever tainted."</p>

<p>Rose Marcario, president and CEO of outdoors company Patagonia, said her company would join the effort to overturn Trump's order.</p>

<p>"The Administration’s unlawful actions betray our shared responsibility to protect iconic places for future generations and represent the largest elimination of protected land in American history," she said. "We’ve fought to protect these places since we were founded and now we’ll continue that fight in the courts."</p>

<p>Polling has suggested that shrinking the monuments would be popular with some Utahns, but national figures suggest little support outside of the Beehive State. A large majority of the comments received during a public comment period on the proposal were in favor of maintaining the monuments as they were.</p>

<p>Protests and lawsuits</p>

<p>Experts suggest the battle over Utah's monuments could lead to an unprecedented test of presidential powers via the Antiquities Act, which Theodore Roosevelt signed into law in 1906 to protect public lands.</p>

<p>The law gives the president broad power to establish national monuments as a way to protect federal land that contains “historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest.”</p>

<p>Under the law, a president can create a monument, but there is no specific language granting authority to rescind or change a designation. Although Congress has abolished monuments 11 times, no president has ever done so.</p>

<p>Shrinking a monument or changing its boundaries could be more complicated.</p>

<p>A Congressional Research Service report on the topic from late last year noted that past presidents have deleted acres from outside monuments by claiming that they didn’t meet the Antiquities Act standard of protecting the “smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected.”</p>

<p>Protesters gather before a visit by President Donald Trump to announce that he is scaling back two sprawling national monuments, Monday Dec. 4, 2017, in Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>Supporters of the Bears Ears National Monument, led by a coalition made up of the Uintah and Ouray Ute, Hopi, Ute Mountain and Zuni tribal governments, sought the protection “to safeguard the homelands of our ancestors.”</p>

<p>The report concluded the president also has broad authority to modify the management of monuments, although “the outer boundaries of this authority, too, appear to be untested.”</p>

<p>Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who reviewed the Utah monuments along with two dozen others at Trump's order earlier this year, said he thought there was "no doubt" the president could amend a monument.</p>

<p>“Legally, it’s untested,” Zinke said. “I would think that (if) the president would nullify a monument, it would be challenged and then the court would determine whether or not the legal framework allows it or not.”</p>
