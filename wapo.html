<p>There have been so many worthy stories since our last installment of Trump Watch, I hardly know where to begin. Nearly all of course are related to the border separations. But here are a few of the more egregious . . .</p>

<ul>
<li>Trump’s executive order has created a new border crisis, as immigration officials will now need to figure out how to reconcile his “zero-tolerance” order with the order not to separate families with existing law, which limits the detention of minor immigrants to 20 days.</li>

<li>Parents are now struggling to navigate the bureaucratic labyrinth to find their kids.</li>

<li>U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents set up a “checkpoint” on Interstate 95 in Maine to inquire about motorists’ citizenship.</li>

<li>Here’s a story about a 3-year-old boy in immigration court.</li>

<li>In most cases, the crime that the Trump administration finds so serious that it merits the separation of families (entering the country illegally) has typically resulted in a $10 fine (and deportation).</li>

<li>Sinclair Broadcast Group is forcing all of its news stations to air a commentary by a former Trump campaign official arguing that media accounts of the separations have been exaggerated.</li>

<li>The real “hoax” in all of this is the ceaseless onslaught of lies from Trump and his administration about immigration in America. My colleague Catherine Rampell takes on the herculean task of breaking them all down.</li>

<li>Here are the companies making millions off the detention, transport and holding of migrant children.</li>

<li>Here’s some important background on how Trump inherited the machinery to enact these policies from his predecessors, and how moral panic over sex and human trafficking gave the administration cover for the separation policy.</li>

<li>The Justice Department denied a Salvadoran woman’s asylum claim because she provided “material support” to terrorists — by working as a slave laborer.</li>

<li>In non-immigration news, sources say the National Enquirer shared stories about Trump with Trump lawyer Michael Cohen before publication.</li>

<li>Congress is considering a bill that would give the Justice Department — and Attorney General Jeff Sessions — massive new powers to wage the war on drugs.</li>

<li>And in a speech to the National Sheriffs’ Association this week that was buried under the immigration coverage, Sessions laid out his vision for federal criminal-justice policy. He is advocating a return to Reagan-era drug and sentencing policy.</li>

<h2 id="whatifwetreatedviolentcrimethewaywetreatebola">What if we treated violent crime the way we treat Ebola?</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-17</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/06/18/what-if-we-treated-violent-crime-the-way-we-treat-ebola/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Last month, I expressed some skepticism about a new study cited by Attorney General Jeff Sessions that blames something called the “ACLU effect” for the 2016 spike in homicides in Chicago. The theory is that an agreement between the city and the civil liberties organization resulted in fewer stops and stop-and-frisks by Chicago police, which caused an increase in violence. You can read the post to see why I don’t find that convincing.</p>

<p>So what did cause the increase? And why hasn’t crime dropped in Chicago the way it has in, say, New York?</p>

<p>One interesting difference between the two cities is that New York doesn’t have anywhere near the gang violence that Chicago does. About a decade ago, a study by the Justice Policy Institute offered a reason for that. The interventionist, public-health-based approach adopted by New York in the 1970s and 1980s was simply more effective than the heavy-handed suppression approach in cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles. “The evidence that punitive responses to youth crime do not effectively increase public safety mounts,” the authors concluded. They recommended “implementation of evidence-based practices to treat young people who are in conflict with the law” and urged that “funding for such programs should be routed through the health and human services system, where they have been proven to be more effective than in the criminal justice system.”</p>

<p>Content from Cleveland Clinic</p>

<p>"We don't have barriers between the science part of Cleveland Clinic and the clinical part. Knowledge and experience flow both ways." </p>

<p>The good news is that funding such programs tends to be cheaper than funding anti-gang task forces and other aggressive law enforcement approaches. The bad news is that it’s often hard to convince people that such programs really are effective.</p>

<p>In Chicago, a group called Cure Violence has been successful in reducing violence in nearly every area of the city it has been tried. The organization takes a public-health-based approach to violence, sending trained counselors (sometimes former gang members and formerly incarcerated people) to intervene in disputes before they turn bloody. In March 2015, the state of Illinois cut funding for the organization, reducing the number of workers from 71 to 10. Until then, shootings in the communities where the organization was operating had been in steady decline. After the cuts, shootings began to soar. Moreover, the only police district in the city where the group had enough staff to continue to operate also happened to be the only district where shootings dropped between 2014 and 2017.</p>

<p>Gary Slutkin, the founder and chief executive of Cure Violence, agreed to an email interview.</p>

<p>Tell us what Cure Violence does, and what it has been doing in Chicago in particular.</p>

<p>Cure Violence is a global violence prevention initiative whose sole purpose is to reduce violence through the application of public health methods. I am a physician and infectious disease specialist who worked with the World Health Organization on epidemics of cholera, tuberculosis and AIDS. I became involved in violence prevention when I returned to the U.S. and saw unavoidable similarities between the spread of disease and the spread of violence in U.S. cities — in Chicago, but also in all of the cities I studied. I summarized what I found in an Institute of Medicine Report in 2013.</p>

<p>So the approach to managing this epidemic is the same as for other health epidemics: early detection and interruption of events and transmission (spread), identification and treatment of those at highest risk, and changing overall community norms.</p>

<p>Currently, Cure Violence operates through partnerships in about 50 communities across more than 20 cities in the U.S., as well as in 10 countries – including in Latin America (Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Colombia and elsewhere), Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<p>In the summer and fall of 2017, Cure Violence got a return of funding to operate at 10 sites in Chicago, and other community groups got funds from philanthropy to operate similar intervention programs in 8 sites (with overlap) for a total of 15 sites.</p>

<p>How are you funded? </p>

<p>Cure Violence has been funded over the years by government, foundations and philanthropy. Major funders in the U.S. have been the U.S. [Department] of Justice and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Major funders of our international work have been mostly the international development community such as the U.S. Agency for International Development, the World Bank, IDB (Inter-American Development Bank), and others.</p>

<p>Cure Violence city and community sites in the U.S. are funded by a variety of sources – public and private. In Chicago, Cure Violence sites have historically been largely funded by the State of Illinois and philanthropy. Today, most of the sites are funded by the State of Illinois, with several others funded by a group of foundations that are also supporting violence prevention efforts around the city.</p>

<p>In other cities, the funding structure varies.New York City is primarily funded by city government, with some communities supported by state or federal funds. Baltimore started as primarily federally funded, but has since received significant private funding, and just recently received state funding for new expansion. Latin America is funded by USAID, IDB, UBS Optimus, and other private foundations</p>

<p>Cure Violence receives a lot of requests from communities, so the demand is usually greater than what we can deliver. This is especially the case for poor cities.</p>

<p>You’ve claimed that empirical evidence overwhelmingly shows that your approach is working. Can you give us a summary of that evidence? </p>

<p>The program has been independently evaluated several times in several different locations and has consistently shown large reductions [in] violence – as much as 70 percent.</p>

<p>The first implementation of our approach began in Chicago in 2000 in West Garfield Park. We saw a 67 percent reduction in shootings and killings. We then replicated the approach in four other communities with an average drop of 45 percent. We’ve been continuously operating in Chicago since, but with ups and downs in our funding, usually related to state budgets. As funding has increased or decreased, we’ve seen an inverse relationship with violence every time.</p>

<p>(Image courtesy of Cure Violence. Note: CeaseFire is now called Cure Violence.)</p>

<p>There have since been three independent evaluations of our work to reduce shootings and killings in Chicago, as well as several other independent evaluations in other cities, also with strong results.</p>

<p>A recent evaluation of the NYC program is perhaps most convincing. It was a very sophisticated analysis, done by experienced researchers using police data, hospital data, interviews and surveys. It showed not only reductions in shootings by up to 63 percent, and a change in norms (towards rejecting the use of violence). It also showed that the program resulted in an increase in confidence in police. We’ve heard from several people that this study convinced them even more that the Cure Violence approach really worked.</p>

<p>Here are some U.S. evaluation highlights (there [are] more — see our website):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>New York City: 37 to 50 percent reduction in gun injuries, 63 percent reduction in shootings, increased confidence in and willingness to contact law enforcement, evidence of norm change on violence</p></li>

<li><p>Baltimore: Up to 56 percent reduction in killings, 44 percent reduction in shootings, evidence of norm change</p></li>

<li><p>Chicago: 41 to 73 percent reduction in shootings and killings, 100 percent reduction in retaliations </p></li>

<li><p>Chicago (hospital): 50 percent reduction in re-injury </p></li>

<li><p>New Orleans: 47 percent reduction in shootings victims, 44 percent reduction in shooting re-injury</p></li>

<li><p>Philadelphia: 30 percent reduction in shootings</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There will be an evaluation of the Trinidad replication released soon – their local presentation showed a 67 percent drop in shootings and killings.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently cited a paper that blamed the “ACLU effect” for the rise in homicides in the city in 2016. But some have pointed to a reduction in funding to groups like yours. What’s the evidence for the latter? </p>

<p>The simplest answer to your question is to point out that violence in Chicago shot up immediately after a large program was shut down that was specifically designed to prevent violence and had been repeatedly shown to be highly effective. When you dig deeper into the data, the case for the increase in violence in Chicago being linked to cuts to Cure Violence becomes even stronger. The data shows that the increase occurred at the same time and in the same places as the cut to Cure Violence, and that at the one site in which funding continued, violence continued to go down. The increase in killings was very predicable. In fact we did predict it at the time.</p>

<p>(Image courtesy of Cure Violence. Note: CeaseFire is now called Cure Violence.)</p>

<p>The evidence is summarized here, with a longer analysis linked to in the report. The correlation isn’t just about when, it’s also about where.</p>

<p>Cure Violence funding was cut in March 2015, which resulted in us being shut down at all sites but one. The increase in violence also began in March 2015, not in 2016 as is commonly reported, and it grew throughout the summer in comparison to prior years.</p>

<p>The one site that remained operational continued to have reductions. Also, not only did the areas that were shut down show increases, but the largest increase occurred in the district where Cure Violence had the most workers (and the longest lasting and most embedded workers).</p>

<p>Further, this has also happened before, and it has reversed before with the return of funding and staffing. For example, in 2007, 18 months of interrupted funding from a budget impasse and political fight resulted in an increase of 50 killings and 400 shootings. Violence then dropped rapidly when Cure Violence was re-funded and able to get up and running again. We saw the same thing in 2011-2012. Way back in 2004, Cure Violence received an increase in funding that allowed us to go from five sites to 15, and then to 20, and from 20 workers to 80. Killings in the areas where we were working dropped 50 percent. Killings across the entire city dropped 25 percent.</p>

<p>The wide disparity in the crime rate between New York and Chicago has spurred a lot of speculation about what New York has done right, and what Chicago has done wrong. What’s your theory?</p>

<p>The difference in how New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago have addressed community violence is incredibly instructive to communities everywhere. New York City embraced the health approach to preventing violence beginning in 2009 and Los Angeles in 2006 – and they have never stopped. We have done all the training and support in NYC (there are now 18 sites, expanding to 22) working with the community groups, health department and mayor’s office. We helped Los Angeles get organized in 2005 and 2006, but they’ve since adapted it to their own needs — and have done very well. Both cities have had uninterrupted funding.</p>

<p>New York City invests more than $25 million a year. This has resulted in reduced levels of violence, as confirmed by two independent evaluations. At a community level, this means that among people at high risk for involvement in violence, intervention is happening much earlier, and in a way that is much more helpful, supportive, and acceptable. So in addition to the reduction in violence, the program is helping people stay out of prison, it’s preventing negative interactions with police, it’s helping with employment, and much more. Cure Violence has effectively replaced stop and frisk in New York. Practically, that means the city is primarily helping people day to day, rather than harassing or bothering them.</p>

<p>For two and-a-half years in Chicago, beginning in March of 2015, no one was filling those roles. Most critically, no one was working to stop the spread of contagious violence, the kind where one act leads to retaliation, which leads to another retaliation, and so on. This is a major reason why Chicago went from just over 400 to about 760 or so murders annually in just a matter of 2 years. It was essentially an unmanaged epidemic. This part of the problem is being remedied now that funding has returned, from both the state and from philanthropic organizations – for Cure Violence and for other critically important community partner organizations doing great work..</p>

<p>Let’s say every large city adopted the Cure Violence model. What would policing look in those cities? </p>

<p>What we say is that we need to treat violence as a health issue, and what we advocate for is the effective prevention of violent behavior through highly specific public health methods.</p>

<p>All other epidemics are managed by public health. They’re managed from the inside out, with health officials guiding and training healthcare workers, collecting and using data, and ensuring results. By managing violence as a health issue, we’re able to detect potential violence before it happens, to mediate conflicts before they turn violent. These interventions are done by credible, highly trained workers. (They get over 100 hours of training before the start, then ongoing on the job.) They know how to talk to people in these communities, and they’re known throughout the community as a resource in violence prevention. Our workers identify those most likely to be violent, then intervene to reduce the risk. They also work to change norms in the community so that violence is discouraged. This is very similar to how health workers help people in [cases of] Ebola, cholera and other epidemics. You change behavior to prevent the disease from spreading.</p>

<p>If this is done effectively, and resourced properly, violence can be prevented so that police are not needed as frequently — and are much less likely to be needed for highly traumatic and stressful violent events. Policing would be a backup, a last resort. Policing in cities would look much more like policing in the suburbs. We’d need much less from law enforcement day to day.</p>

<p>I managed a TB epidemic in San Francisco. We put about five people out of 2,500 in jail, temporarily. But only kept [them] there the minimum time necessary — until they were no longer infectious. Police were backup only. Both the police and immigration wanted to get more involved, but it was the health workers who did the detection and encouraged the changes in behavior. I also managed a cholera epidemic in Somalia where a Somali general wanted to shoot the patients to stop the epidemic. They didn’t understand the means of spread. During the last Ebola epidemic in West Africa, some of the policing efforts actually contributed to the spread of the virus. In the end, it again was health workers who changed the course of the outbreak.</p>

<p>For the most part, our behavioral norms are formed, maintained and changed through the expectations of others — mostly our peers. This is especially true when it comes to dangerous or violent acts. Much as we’d like to believe otherwise, the imposition of consequences has little effect on norms. Young people especially are much more concerned with what their friends think than with what consequences law enforcement may impose for their actions. That’s why local and credible health workers are so effective, and punitive approaches are less effective. Whether we do or don’t use condoms, do or don’t smoke cigarettes, and most of our behaviors are much more contingent on what our peers think than about laws, police or consequences.</p>

<p>Right now, there is an enormous gap in reducing violence that the health field needs to fill. In many places where these programs are operating, the police already know to, and do leave, retaliation prevention and violence detection to interrupters and outreach workers. Yet the public is not aware of this because our work is largely behind the scenes (as with all public health), and we don’t make public announcements every time we prevent an act of violence. We’ll of course still need police and courts if someone breaks the law — that is their role. However, there will be a lot less law-breaking when public health is brought to sufficient scale.</p>

<p>You’ve mentioned some studies showing that public confidence in the police has actually increased in the neighborhoods where you’ve been working. Why do you think that is?</p>

<p>Without more study, its impossible to know for certain why confidence in policing increased. What we do know is that these communities had large reductions in violence, and they had workers who were mediating very dangerous conflicts. One hypothesis is that the police were less likely to be involved in highly traumatic and stressful situations — the kind that drive distrust in law enforcement. Another hypothesis [is that] when there’s less violence, the community feels safer, and when the community feels safer, they think the police are doing a good job.</p>

<p>How does the law enforcement community react to your group — in Chicago and elsewhere? Are they supportive? Antagonistic? Indifferent? Is there a difference between the attitudes of police leadership and rank and file cops?</p>

<p>Most police accept us and get the approach, and that’s true among both the leadership and the rank and file. Our staff and I have been thanked by many police officers for our work. Many police leaders credit our workers for the reductions in violence in their community. What these police officers realize is that Cure Violence workers can make their jobs easier by de-escalating situations, by dealing with individuals who are known to be high risk and by reducing overall violence in the community. All of this makes police officers safer themselves and more respected in a community.</p>

<p>Generally, the police officers who work closely with Cure Violence are highly positive, while in areas where the program is new, they may be more reluctant. Some police officers can also be reluctant to praise our work publicly. Some have trouble accepting workers who were formerly involved in violent crimes. This attitude is a holdover of the “bad people” theory — which of course is what we used to think about people who contracted diseases. That attitude tends to change as they start to understand and work with the health approach.</p>

<p>I was going to ask about that. Many of your counselors and “violence interrupters” are formerly incarcerated people, or people previously involved with gangs or violent crime. Can you explain why you use them, and why you think they’re effective?</p>

<p>Utilizing credible workers is a standard practice of public health. I’ve used it for other epidemics for 20 years. To change the behavior of sex workers, we hire former sex workers. To change sanitary habits in refugee camps, you hire refugees. When you are trying to change behavior, it is far more effective to use credible, trusted people — people who have shared interest and experience with the people whose behavior you’re trying to change. When the workers are from the same background and same community as the clients, the program is more trusted, influential and credible. It’s easier to follow up.</p>

<p>What are the biggest misconceptions about violence? What else should the public know about how to prevent it?</p>

<p>Here are some of the things we’ve learned from our work:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Violence is the only contagious epidemic that isn’t primarily managed by the health sector. So what we have in most cities with a crime problem are unmanaged or undermanaged epidemics of violence. This includes mass shootings. What we have in Latin America and the Middle East are also unmanaged epidemics of violence. There is much more that can be done to prevent these epidemics.</p></li>

<li><p>The breadth and scope of data showing both that violence is contagious and that health approaches are effective is overwhelming. There are thousands of studies showing violence to be a health problem and hundreds showing that it’s contagious. Most people think prevention is complicated, or takes a long time. The evidence that intervention works is also overwhelming. Also, the results come fast — usually in the first few months — and the results are sustained. </p></li>

<li><p>We can also apply these approaches to mass shootings. We generally know who the people are who are at most risk for being violent, yet we are failing to do enough to prevent them from acting. The people who are at risk have health or social problems and they often give warning signs, but those who have concerns either don’t want to go to officials (they don’t want to get their friend or family member in trouble based merely on suspicion) or the officials they go to don’t have the skills or time for prevention. </p></li>

<li><p>People think that if you have a serious problem, you need police. The most serious problems need intervention — fast solutions with interrupters. </p></li>

<li><p>In many communities, we see not only a large reduction in violence but a complete eradication of killings for months, or even years. In epidemic control, you work toward elimination of the contagion, not merely a reduction. A reduction of Ebola would not be acceptable, since the contagion can spread quickly. Similarly, we employ specific techniques aimed at eliminating violence completely. Just a few events could cause another outbreak.</p></li>

<li><p>Most importantly, public health epidemic control techniques have been highly underutilized for reducing the violence epidemics that continue to plague us and for which we keep being frustrated. Public health has the expertise to find and stop rare events before they happen, prevent spread, and change behaviors. We are greatly underutilizing this expertise, although more and more cities are now beginning to step up.</p></li>

<h2 id="jeffsessionsblamestheacluforchicagoshomiciderateheswrong">Jeff Sessions blames the ACLU for Chicago’s homicide rate. He’s wrong.</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-14</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/05/15/jeff-sessions-blames-the-aclu-for-chicagos-homicide-rate-hes-wrong/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>In two speeches now, one on May 8 to the Gatlinburg Law Enforcement Training Conference, and then one Monday night to the National Association of Police Organizations (an association of organizations!), Attorney General Jeff Sessions has blamed the ACLU for the surge in Chicago homicides in 2016.</p>

<p>The source for this claim is a recent paper by Paul Cassell and Richard Fowles, two professors at the University of Utah. Cassell, it’s worth pointing out, is a former federal judge and defender of law-and-order policy. He recently represented (successfully) the Utah police officer who was facing criminal charges for shooting and killing Danielle Willard. (He also blogs at the Volokh Conspiracy, formerly hosted here at The Washington Post, and now hosted at Reason magazine.)</p>

<p>In their paper, Cassell and Fowles claim that murders spiked in Chicago because of an agreement between the city and the ACLU that requires police in the city to document each street stop they conduct. Note that the agreement does not prohibit the stops. It only asks that they be documented to assess whether police are violating the rights of Chicago residents. The aim is to determine if these stops are being done because of reasonable suspicion or if they’re motivated by unconstitutional racial or ethnic bias. The number of stops plummeted by 75 percent the following year — 2016, the same year that saw a 60 percent spike in homicides. Cassell and Fowles link the two statistics to come up with the “ACLU effect” that Sessions is touting:</p>

<p>“We conclude that, because of fewer stop and frisks in 2016, a conservative estimate is that approximately 236 additional homicides and 1115 additional shootings occurred that year. A reasonable estimate of the social costs associated with these additional homicides and shootings is about $1,500,000,000. And these costs are concentrated in Chicago’s African-American and Hispanic communities.”</p>

<p>The study has been criticized in a number of places, including by Salvador Rizzo here at The Washington Post, and by John Rappaport at Slate. The main criticism is that street stops in other cities have also fallen — in some places pretty dramatically — without a corresponding rise in homicides such as the one we’ve seen in Chicago. For example, Street stops in New York City fell from 685,000 in 2011 to just under 23,000 in 2015. Despite dire warnings from supporters of stop and frisk that the city was about to endure a bloodbath, the city’s homicide rate hit record lows.</p>

<p>In their paper, Cassell and Fowles dismiss what happened in New York as an “anomaly.” They suggest that the two cities may have seen different results because New York has more police per capita than Chicago.</p>

<p>Another problem in equating New York’s circumstances with Chicago’s is that the level of police power is different. New York has high levels of law enforcement. For example, if we look to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports for 2016, New York had 51,399 police employees compared to 13,135 for Chicago, which even when adjusted for population size, means that New York’s overall police force was, on a per capita basis, about 25% larger than Chicago’s. But this comparison fails to capture the true workload differences between the two cities. Using the same crime (homicide) as used by the Crime Lab study, New York had about 153 law enforcement employees for every homicide committed in the city, while Chicago had only about 17 employees for every homicide committed — about a 800% difference.</p>

<p>But this number is inflated by the NYPD’s substantial bureaucratic bloat — NYPD employs about 5,000 people who aren’t uniformed police officers. It seems unlikely that civilian employees working in, say, the NYPD human resources department are going to do much to deter crime. If we look at the number of actual police officers — Chicago actually has slightly more cops per capita than New York.</p>

<p>But New York is far from an anomaly. As Rizzo points out, cities such as Newark, Seattle and Philadelphia also dramatically decreased the number of stop and frisks and didn’t see a Chicago-like spike in homicides. Philadelphia, for example, entered into a consent decree in 2011 that reduced the number of stop and frisks. Two years later, homicides in the city hit a 45-year low. (The city did see a five-year high in homicides in 2017, but also saw an increase in gun arrests the same year. Meanwhile, all other violent crime declined.) Rappaport also notes that homicides did spike in other cities in 2016 at rates similar to Chicago, but those cities did not significantly alter their policies on stop and frisk. All of this suggests that the spike was driven by other factors.</p>

<p>The ACLU itself also responded to the Cassell-Fowles study. The group noted that the agreement with the city of Chicago was similar to a state law that took effect in 2016 requiring all police agencies in the state to create a record of street stops. None of the state’s other largest cities saw a significant increase in homicides.</p>

<p>Critics of the study also point out that Illinois has been reducing funding for a number of anti-violence initiatives over the past several years, some of which have been found to produce real results. The critics also note a possible phenomenon we’ve discussed at length here at The Watch: As minority communities lose trust in and respect for the police, they stop cooperating with law enforcement. Crime goes up. There’s good anecdotal evidence for this. Crime has spiked in places such as Baltimore, the St. Louis area, Cleveland and Chicago. Perhaps not coincidentally, the Justice Department (before Sessions took over) issued blistering reports for each of these cities showing widespread police abuse, little unaccountability for bad cops, rampant racial profiling, and constitutional violations so common that they’re customary. More recently, a study in Milwaukee found that after high-profile incidents of possible police abuse, 911 calls from black neighborhoods declined. The same researchers found a similar pattern after other high-profile police shootings in other parts of the country.</p>

<p>There’s ample reason for Chicago residents to distrust their police department. The city, of course, saw the release of video of the Laquan McDonald video. The city is still sorting out the repercussions from the revelation that for two decades some officers tortured people without consequence. The recent Justice Department report on the Chicago Police Department was jaw-dropping. A Chicago Reporter investigation found that between 2011 and 2016, the city paid out over $280 million to settle police brutality lawsuits. In 2015, the Guardian reported that city police took suspects to “black sites” where they were detained and beaten.</p>

<p>Over at the Volokh Conspiracy, Cassell has written an unsatisfying response to some of these criticisms. In response to the argument that the state’s decrease (or in some cases, elimination) of funding for anti-violence programs may have contributed to the homicide spike, Cassell writes, “For example, Rappaport suggests that a reduction in funding for a social program known as “Ceasefire” might be the cause. An analysis by the Chicago Crime Lab found that this explanation doesn’t fit, because the cessation in funding was well before the spike took place.”</p>

<p>It’s interesting that Cassell favorably cites the Chicago Crime Lab, because the same report is also dismissive of the theory that fewer police stops caused the murder spike.</p>

<p>As for CeaseFire, the report’s language isn’t outright dismissive; it only suggests that the timing isn’t conducive to studying cause and effect. And the funding wasn’t cut off “well before” the spike began; it was less than a year. Moreover, as Rappaport notes, a recent Northwestern study did find that CeaseFire (now called Cure Violence) “reduced shootings by 41 to 73 percent in seven Chicago communities.” The group itself also has some convincing data showing that after funding was cut, homicides rose dramatically in the communities where the group had previously been working.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Chicago Crime Lab report does address the funding cuts to community and anti-violence programs more generally. Far from concluding that the cuts had no impact, it instead explains that there isn’t enough data available to say one way or the other:</p>

<p>. . . the recent deterioration in the financial condition of the state of Illinois, and the resulting budget impasse, seems to have caused disruptions for many community organizations that rely on state funding. The cumulative effect of these service disruptions and their impact on gun violence in 2016, however, is difficult to gauge without more detailed data on their exact magnitude and timing.</p>

<p>As for the argument that public scandals and high-profile shootings such as that of Laquan McDonald may have caused Chicago’s black residents to be less trustful of police, Cassell writes:</p>

<p>. . . in any event, we collected monthly 9-1-1 call data from Chicago during the relevant time period. Directly contradicting Rappaport’s speculative hypothesis, the call data show a longterm downward trend—no sharp break around the time of the McDonald video release.</p>

<p>Of course, the argument that Chicago’s black residents have a fractured relationship with the city’s police doesn’t start and stop with the McDonald video. It’s about the torture scandal. It’s about the abuses documented in the Justice Department report. It’s about the hundreds of millions of dollars paid out for police brutality settlements. It is, in fact, precisely the sort of culmination of scandals, reports and day-to-day interactions that would result in the “longterm downward trend” Cassell describes. And according to Five Thirty Eight, the spike in both fatal and nonfatal shootings began just after the release of the McDonald video in November 2015, not after the implementation of the new policy in January 2016.</p>

<p>But the strongest evidence that Chicago residents — and black residents in particular — are losing trust in their police department is polling data. For example, here’s a Chicago Tribune editorial about a poll released in February 2016, the same year of the homicide spike that’s the subject of the Cassell-Fowles study.</p>

<p>Most Chicagoans — 70 percent of all respondents — said they don’t believe police officers treat all citizens fairly. Nearly as many — 64 percent — said cover-ups and a code of silence in the Chicago Police Department are widespread problems. … Only 20 percent of respondents said they believe city cops treat all citizens fairly.</p>

<p>Distrust is rampant citywide, but perceptions vary by race. Among whites, 53 percent said they don’t think the police treat everyone fairly, while one-third said they do. But in the African-American community, faith in the police to do their job well is practically nonexistent. Do Chicago police treat all citizens fairly? Among blacks, 85 percent said no, while just 6 percent said yes. Among Hispanics: 69 percent said no, while 23 percent said yes.</p>

<p>A separate 2016 Northwestern study found that among Chicago’s black residents who had been stopped and frisked, trust in police dropped by 45 percent.</p>

<p>For comparison, national polling done at about the same time put overall trust in police at 57 percent, and support among blacks at 30 percent.</p>

<p>Cassell also responds to the criticism that his study focuses only on one city, and that their conclusions about Chicago are contradicted by data from other cities.</p>

<p>[Rappaport] also notes that in 2016, other cities had homicide spikes, suggesting that homicides can increase for reasons apart from changes in police tactics. But our research tried to explain what was going on in one important city—Chicago—where our research tools and data could explore what was happening. Every city has its own story to tell, and we have tried to tell one chapter of Chicago’s.</p>

<p>But of course the intent of the paper is to prescribe stop and frisk as a national policy. That’s certainly how Sessions is using their study. And it’s how the authors themselves characterize its conclusions.</p>

<p>. . . these findings shed important light on the on-going national debate about stop and frisk policies. The fact that America’s “Second City” suffered so badly from a decline in stop and frisks suggests that the arguably contrary experience in New York City may be an anomaly. The costs of crime—and particularly gun crimes—are too significant to avoid considering every possible measure for reducing the toll. The evidence gathered here suggests that stop and frisk policies may be truly lifesaving measures that have to be considered as part of any effective law enforcement response to gun violence.</p>

<p>In other words, they’re suggesting that Chicago is the norm, New York is the anomaly, and that stop and frisk should be considered “part of any effective law enforcement response to gun violence.” (Emphasis added.)</p>

<p>In closing, Cassell points out that he isn’t trying to “scapegoat anyone.” But of course he is. In specifically naming the ACLU, and putting the organization in the title of his paper, he’s giving fodder to politicians such as Sessions to blame Chicago’s murders on the people and groups who work to protect the constitutional rights of Chicago’s residents. It’s red meat for law-and-order voters.</p>

<p>Even if Cassell and Fowles are correct (and again, I don’t think they are), the communities where stop and frisk is most heavily enforced are essentially Fourth Amendment free. According to the survey done in conjunction with that 2016 Northwestern study, nearly 7 in 10 young black men in Chicago had been stopped and frisked in the previous year. And according to that study, many had been subjected to it more than once: “Blacks and Hispanics were also repeatedly targeted and stopped multiple times in the course of a year, especially while they were out walking.” In one neighborhood, blacks made up 9 percent of the population, but comprised 60 percent of police stops. Citywide, 7 in 10 streets stops were black suspects, and blacks were far more likely to be frisked after a stop.</p>

<p>(These disparities have continued after implementation of the new policy, though the number of overall stops has dropped dramatically.) Overall, just 6 percent of stops produced drugs or weapons. A common response here is that blacks are more likely to commit crimes; therefore, they’re more likely to be targeted by police. The problem is, that assumption isn’t backed up by the data. A Chicago Sun-Times study found that just 2 percent of all stops produced a gun, and another 4 percent produced guns or other contraband. That means that 94 percent of the people stopped were innocent. Importantly, those figures were consistent across races and ethnic groups.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting again that the ACLU agreement with the city did not prohibit street stops or stop and frisks. It merely required that the city’s police officers document those stops so their constitutionality could be assessed at a later date. Cassell and other defenders of stop and frisk argue that the burden of filling out a form dissuaded the city’s cops from making such stops. That’s one possible explanation, though it’s always interesting when defenders of law enforcement argue that police officers are so sensitive that they’ll simply stop doing their jobs at the slightest inconvenience or risk of oversight. Another possible explanation is that city police knew that most of the stops that they had been making were unconstitutional — they were based on little more than the race or ethnicity of the suspect. They knew that documenting such stops would get them into trouble, so they stopped making the unconstitutional stops. In fact, before the new policy, the ACLU of Illinois estimated that at least half of such stops in Chicago were unconstitutional.</p>

<p>It’s of course important to point out when law-and-order types (or anyone else) have mistaken correlation with causation, as Cassell and Fowles seem to have done. And the good news is that there’s plenty of evidence to support the notion that constitutional policing is pretty effective at keeping the country safe. But in the end, the Fourth Amendment and other constitutional protections aren’t (or at least shouldn’t be) subject to a cost-benefit analysis. If we were to repeal the Bill of Rights entirely and give police free rein, crime would probably drop pretty dramatically. After all, violent crime is nearly nonexistent in most totalitarian states. We value our rights more. Sometimes, valuing our rights means sacrificing public safety. Fortunately, when it comes to stop and frisk, that just doesn’t appear to be true, no matter how many times Jeff Sessions says it.</p>

<h2 id="yetanotherbitemarkconvictionisunraveling">Yet another bite-mark conviction is unraveling</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-20</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/05/21/yet-another-bite-mark-conviction-is-unraveling/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>In 1991, a Pennsylvania man named John Kunco was convicted of raping and beating a 55-year-old woman the previous December. The state’s case against Kunco was based almost entirely on the testimony of two bite-mark analysts. The police collected more than 40 other samples of forensic materials, including blood, hair and clothing fibers. None of it implicated Kunco. The bite-mark testimony was the only physical evidence linking him to the crime.</p>

<p>Even in the best case scenarios, bite mark evidence is of dubious scientific value. But this case was especially problematic. The police did photograph an alleged bite mark on the victim’s shoulder shortly after the crime, but they neglected to include a ruler to scale the image. They also failed to swab the bite itself for saliva.</p>

<p>The police began to look at Kunco after the victim claimed that her assailant’s voice sounded like the voice of a former maintenance worker in her apartment building named “John.” But she also said she had only spoken to Kunco once. She never saw her attacker, and only positively identified Kunco based on his voice, and even then, not based on Kunco’s voice itself, but on a detective’s imitation of Kunco’s lisp. Kunco became the main suspect.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for police and prosecutors, as forensic reports came back on the material collected at the scene, there was nothing to implicate Kunco. Five months after the crime, the police still had little evidence against him.</p>

<p>To properly contextualize what happened next, we need to consider when this happened. Kunco’s trial occurred during the heyday of bite-mark analysis, and of pattern-matching forensics in general. Violent crime was soaring, and politicians were bending over backwards to give police and prosecutors new tools to keep the country safe. Anyone who could contribute to putting bad guys away was generally viewed with little skepticism. Advanced DNA testing that would reveal entire fields of forensics to be badly flawed was still a few years away.</p>

<p>One forensics superstar of this era was Michael West, a cocky dentist from Hattiesburg, Miss., who claimed that by shining florescent light on skin and donning a pair of yellow goggles, he could see wounds that had been inflicted months before, and had long ago healed (or so it would seem!). Over the years, West has claimed that the idea for this method — which he called “The West Phenomenon” — came to him while he was giving lectures in China and was told about an ancient Chinese surgeon who noticed that battlefield wounds looked different in light that had been filtered through a silk tent. But in researching our recent book, “The Cadaver King and the Country Dentist”, my co-author Tucker Carrington and I found some local news reports from the early 1980s indicating that West likely got the idea from a Kansas forensic dentist named Thomas Krauss. West has since been discredited and no longer testifies, but his influence on the early development of bite-mark analysis can’t be overstated.</p>

<p>American Board of Forensic Odontology (ABFO)-certified bite mark analysts Michael N. Sobel and Thomas J. David were familiar with West and his revolutionary new method of analysis. In an article they would later write for the Journal of Forensic Sciences, they described how they utilized the use of ultraviolet light to “recapture” the mark on the Pennsylvania woman’s shoulder. (They credit West in a footnote.) Sobel and David claimed not only that they could recreate the bite, but they could also say that it was a match to John Kunco’s teeth, using the meaningless standard “to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.” Courtesy of forensic skeptic Michael Bowers, you can see the original photo next to the “recaptured” bite below.</p>

<p>Kunco also had an alibi. Not only was he home with his girlfriend and their newborn baby on the night of the attack, his landlord testified that he was actually speaking to Kunco on the phone at the exact time that police believe the attack took place. It didn’t matter. Kunco was convicted, and given a prison sentence of 45 years to 90 years.</p>

<p>The bite-mark evidence was critical to the state’s case. Consider this passage, from the prosecutor’s closing statement to the jury:</p>

<p>[T]here’s no way, no way on this earth, for Mr. Kunco to explain how his tooth marks got on Donna Seaman’s shoulder unless you accept the fact that he’s the one who attacked and brutalized Mrs. Seaman. That’s the only explanation, ladies and gentlemen. That’s why the evidence is better than fingerprints or hair samples . . . . [T]he bite mark on [Donna] Seaman’s shoulder was as good as a fingerprint. And I submit to you it was that, ladies and gentlemen, for all intents and purposes. Ladies and gentlemen, I’d submit to you that John Kunco should have just signed his name on Donna Seaman’s back, because the bite mark on Donna Seaman’s shoulder belongs to John Kunco.</p>

<p>Kunco has always maintained his innocence. In 2009, DNA excluded Kunco as the source of biological material found on a lamp cord used to strangle the victim. Also in 2009, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report that was strongly critical of the pattern-matching fields of forensics, and was particularly critical of bite mark analysis. Kunco was one of the first people convicted with bite mark evidence to file an appeal based on that report.</p>

<p>Again, he was denied. To get a new trial after you’ve exhausted your appeals, you generally have to show that you’ve found new evidence that points to your innocence, that this new evidence wasn’t available at the time of trial, and you have to file your claim that’s based on that new evidence within one year of when that evidence could have reasonably discovered.</p>

<p>A Pennsylvania judge ruled that Kunco had failed the last requirement. Though Kunco had filed his claim within one year of the publication of the NAS report, she ruled that nearly all of the research that the report was based upon had been published well earlier. That’s all true, but it’s yet another illustration of a problem that we’ve covered quite a bit here at The Watch — defendants who get caught up in this conundrum just can’t win. There is no set point at which a field of forensics widely accepted by the courts officially becomes “discredited.” This particular ruling came in 2011. The judge was correct to point out that bite-mark analysis had been under heavy scrutiny for more than a decade. And yet, to this day, no court in America has upheld a challenge to the validity of such evidence and refused to allow a jury to hear about it. People like Kunco, then, are trapped. File before the court that hears your case thinks science has declared a dubious field of forensics “discredited,” and you’ll lose, and you may be procedurally barred from raising the issue again. But if you wait until more than a year after the first or second or fifth scientific report, and the court may rule that you’ve waited too long.</p>

<p>The judge in Kunco’s case went on to rule that even if Kunco had filed in time, the NAS report did not really discredit bite-mark evidence. To make this point, she misstated what the NAS report actually said. In her opinion, she wrote:</p>

<p>The [NAS] Report does not, however, conclude that the use of bitemark analysis and comparison has lost general acceptance in the scientific community of forensic odontology. Rather, it specifically acknowledges that “the majority of forensic odontologists are satisfied that bite marks can demonstrate sufficient detail for positive identification.”</p>

<p>This is true. But this is like writing, “astrology has not lost general acceptance within the community of astrologers.” Of course “a majority” of forensic odontologists think bite mark analysis is legitimate, because the term “forensic odontologist” is the term of choice used by people who practice bite-mark analysis. (There are a handful of people who use the the term to describe the scientifically-sound practice of using dental records to identify human remains.)</p>

<p>Here’s the portion of the report that includes the clause the judge quoted, with full context:</p>

<p>Although the majority of forensic odontologists are satisfied that bite marks can demonstrate sufficient detail for positive identification, no scientific studies support this assessment, and no large population studies have been conducted. In numerous instances, experts diverge widely in their evaluations of the same bite mark evidence, which has led to questioning of the value and scientific objectivity of such evidence.</p>

<p>Bite mark testimony has been criticized basically on the same grounds as testimony by questioned document examiners and microscopic hair examiners. The committee received no evidence of an existing scientific basis for identifying an individual to the exclusion of all others.</p>

<p>This is far from the only time the 2009 NAS report has been selectively excerpted to convey a sentiment that pretty much contradicts what the authors of the report intended.</p>

<p>Kunco caught a break in 2016, when two bite-mark skeptics within the ABFO submitted affidavits that were critical of Sobel’s and David’s trial testimony. Sobel and David then submitted their own affidavits retracting their testimony and analysis. Without the bite-mark testimony, the state’s case against Kunco consists of (1) the victim’s identification of his voice based not on utterances from Kunco himself, but on a detective’s impersonation of Kunco, and (2) testimony from a woman who claimed to have heard Kunco make a sexual comment about vegetables at a party. (The victim was penetrated with a cucumber.) That comment was not corroborated by others at the party.</p>

<p>Last year, Kunco’s attorneys asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to order more advanced DNA testing on the other biological material preserved from the case. Incredibly, prosecutors fought this. They were prepared to keep Kunco in prison (and potentially allow a rapist to remain free) based only on those two flimsy pieces of evidence. The court disagreed, and ordered testing on the rape kit, the victim’s underwear and girdle and the blanket that was under her when she was attacked.</p>

<p>Last week, Kunco’s attorneys announced that they believe the new tests have exonerated their client. Kunco will get a hearing this week to determine whether he should receive bail while he continues to fight his conviction. If he is eventually cleared, he will be the 31st person either arrested or charged based on bite mark analysis who was later exonerated.</p>

<p>Kunco’s case is merely the latest example of how our criminal justice system just isn’t equipped to distinguish legitimate science from charlatanism. It’s bad enough that the courts let jurors here scientifically suspect expert testimony. Far worse is the appeals’ courts lousy record at correcting those errors, and the strict adherence to procedural requirements, even when doing so is pretty obviously contrary to the interests of justice.</p>

<p>Consider that in 2011 — 10 years after Kunco’s conviction — a judge denied his request for a new trial based on the argument that bite mark analysis is unreliable not because he was necessarily wrong, but because the ample scientific evidence supporting Kunco’s argument had been around for more than a decade, and thus, he had waited too long to use it to his advantage. In addition to the glaring injustice at play here, to punish Kunco for waiting too long to file his claim suggests that he incurred some sort of advantage, or was “gaming the system” by staying in prison much longer than he needed to. It’s absurd.</p>

<p>Now consider that last year, six years after that ruling — a ruling in which, remember, a judge found that Kunco should have argued that bite-mark evidence was illegitimate eight, nine, or even 10 years earlier than he did — bite-mark evidence was again the subject of dispute in a Pennsylvania courtroom. In Blair County, prosecutors were attempting to introduce bite-mark evidence at the murder trial of Paul Aaron Ross. The defense objected, making the same arguments Kunco had, and that countless other defendants have made. In response, the prosecution misquoted the NAS report just as the judge in Kunco’s case had. They also made the same ridiculous argument that in determining whether bite-mark analysis has been accepted within the scientific community, the relevant “scientific community” should be limited to other bite-mark analysts.</p>

<p>The judge ruled in favor of the prosecution.</p>

<p>Corey Williams, center, with lawyers Amir Ali, left, and Blythe Taplin at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in Angola. (Courtesy of Amir Ali)</p>

<p>There was some good news this week in two cases we’ve been following here at The Watch.</p>

<p>The first is the release of Corey Williams in Louisiana. Williams was prosecuted by Hugo Holland, one of the country’s most gung-ho death-penalty prosecutors. Holland was forced to resign in 2012 for supplying false information on a form to procure a cache of M-16s for an ad-hoc SWAT team he had formed with fellow prosecutors. I wrote a long piece about Holland last year. Here’s a summary of Williams’s case from that article:</p>

<p>Williams has an IQ of 68, and suffers from the effects of severe lead poisoning as a child. When the police came to arrest him for the murder of a pizza delivery man, they found him cowering under a bed sheet. Williams, 16 at the time, was one of four young men at the house. One of the other men’s fingerprints were on the murder weapon. Another had the victim’s blood on his sweatshirt. And yet only Williams was charged with first-degree murder. Holland was the prosecutor.</p>

<p>For the first several hours of his interrogation, Williams maintained that he played no role in the murder, and his account was consistent with all the other evidence. He said he was with the other teens when the others decided to rob the delivery man. Williams said he wanted no part of it. When one of the boys then shot the delivery man, Williams fled in fear.</p>

<p>Yet after six hours of questioning late into the night, and without food, water or sleep, Williams finally confessed. He told his interrogators, “I’m ready to go home and lay down.” As Mark Joseph Stern wrote in 2015 for Slate, before Williams’s confession, the police had already pieced together the most probable narrative for the crime, based on interviews with the other teens and other witnesses. In that narrative, Williams was innocent. Williams’s confession was nonsensical and didn’t fit with the known evidence. But after he gave it, the other teens changed their stories to implicate him. At Williams’s trial, Holland told the jury that for the other teens to have conspired to frame Williams would be the greatest conspiracy since the murder of JFK.</p>

<p>Williams was convicted and sentenced to death in 2000. Because of his disability, that sentence was later changed to life without parole, over Holland’s objections.</p>

<p>For 10 years, Holland had said that the tapes of the interviews with the other teens didn’t exist. Instead, Williams’s attorneys, the courts and the jury that convicted Williams had to settle for summaries of those interrogations provided by the state. But in 2015, Williams’s attorneys finally obtained the recordings of the police interrogations of the other teens. They were damning. They revealed that not only was Holland wrong about a conspiracy, but even the interrogating officers believed at the time that the other teens were framing Williams.</p>

<p>Holland’s team also failed to turn over a host of other exculpatory evidence, including statements from witnesses who saw one of the other teens carrying the murder weapon both before and immediately after the crime; statements from police investigators themselves indicating they believed Williams was innocent and had been set up by the others; and statements that one of the other teens and his relatives had threatened witnesses to change their stories. (Note: In October, the Louisiana Supreme Court declined to hear Williams’ appeal. There was no opinion, although two justices dissented.)</p>

<p>All of that evidence was withheld by the same prosecutor who is now being hired to handle death penalty cases all over Louisiana.</p>

<p>That last line was a reference to the main story of that post: After Holland was fired, he was hired by parishes all over the state of Louisiana on a contractual basis, often specifically to handle death-penalty cases. Within just a few years, his freelancing gigs doubled the salary he was making when he was fired. (Williams’s case wasn’t the first time Holland has been accused of misconduct or of not turning over exculpatory evidence.)</p>

<p>The unquestionably good news is that Williams left prison this week. The bad news is that he did so after accepting a deal that required him to plead guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter. It’s completely understandable why Williams’s attorneys negotiated the deal and why he accepted it. Louisiana’s appellate courts are notoriously unfriendly to accusations of prosecutor misconduct. The New Yorker reported that of the 28 death sentences overturned in the state since 1976, 25 were due at least in part to prosecutor misconduct. But only two of those were overturned by state courts; federal courts intervened in all of the others.</p>

<p>This means that while Williams is free, he will also be saddled with a felony conviction. It also means that there will not be an official finding that the state withheld evidence. Nor will this be counted among the state’s many death-row exonerations or its growing tally of exonerations more generally. (Williams was originally sentenced to die. That sentence was revoked due to his disability.)</p>

<p>To be clear, Williams being free is wonderful news. But what he had to do to leave prison demonstrates how even when the criminal-justice system finally admits it got it wrong, it does so in a way that assigns the least culpability possible to the people who are most culpable for the injustice.</p>

<p>The second case showing this is that of John Kunco in Pennsylvania. I’ve been following Kunco’s case for nearly 10 years. As I wrote last week, he was convicted based on testimony from bite-mark analysts that was dubious even in the context of that already dubious field of forensics. The two bite-mark analysts who testified for the state retracted their testimony in 2016. DNA testing done on a lamp cord allegedly used to strangle the victim had already excluded Kunco. Then, last week, Kunco’s attorneys claimed that DNA testing on the rape kit, undergarments worn by the victim and a blanket found at the crime scene would exonerate their client.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a Pennsylvania judge threw out Kunco’s conviction, finding that had the new evidence been presented at trial, the jury likely would not have returned a conviction.</p>

<p>The victims of these injustices go well beyond the wrongly convicted themselves. From the Pittsburgh Tribune:</p>

<p>Loren Kunco was an infant when her father was convicted and said she only learned about the case from her mother, who always believed he was innocent.</p>

<p>She visited her father in prison until the age of 5 but had not seen him since, until Wednesday. She was in court to watch him win his three-decade struggle for freedom.</p>

<p>“I think I always knew he was innocent. The original case file, it’s right in your face that he’s innocent,” Loren Kunco said.</p>

<p>And of course, there’s also the problem that if Kunco is indeed innocent, the real perpetrator either remained free.</p>

<p>Here again, the good news for the wrongly convicted comes with a few caveats. First, the office of Westmoreland County District Attorney John W. Peck has already announced it will appeal the judge’s ruling. That would be an absurd and cruel thing to do. Without the bite-mark evidence, there are only two real pieces of evidence against Kunco. The first is one witness’s claim to have heard him make a sexual comment about vegetables at a party (the victim was assaulted with a cucumber), a claim that was uncorroborated by anyone else at the party. The other piece of evidence is the victim’s alleged identification of Kunco by his lisp. But the victim didn’t identify Kunco’s lisp after hearing Kunco himself talk. She identified him based on a detective’s imitation of Kunco’s lisp. On the other side of the ledger, Kunco had an alibi that was corroborated by the mother of his newborn child and by his landlord. And now there’s the DNA evidence.</p>

<p>More broadly, while this case is yet another example of the utter unreliability of bite-mark analysis, the judge’s ruling will have no effect on the state’s ability to use such evidence in the future. Another Pennsylvania judge approved bite-mark evidence in a separate murder trial just last year. </p>

<p>Again we see in stark detail just how bad the system can be at correcting its mistakes. It has taken 27 years for a judge to finally admit that John Kunco’s conviction was an injustice, and only after DNA testing. But even now, prosecutors still aren’t conceding. Kunco will be free on bail, but the charges still loom over him. Meanwhile, not only has there been no effort to change the procedures that allowed such flawed evidence to be heard by a jury in the first place, the same sort of evidence is still used against other defendants in other trials in Pennsylvania. Our criminal-justice system is terribly bad at admitting and correcting its mistakes. But it’s even worse at learning from them.</p>

<h2 id="issouthcarolinaspoliceoversightdepartmentreallyallthatindependent">Is South Carolina’s police-oversight department really all that independent?</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>Myrtle Beach, S.C., police officer David Belue, after conducting a drug raid on suspect Julian Betton in 2015. (Surveillance video from public files in Betton v. Knowles.)</p>

<p>Back in 2015, I wrote a four-part series on policing in South Carolina. One of the central themes of the series was a state police agency called the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, or SLED. This is generally considered the most elite police agency in the state. It participates in drug investigations, corruption investigations and, perhaps most importantly, when there is an officer-involved shooting, it is SLED that comes to investigate (this is true in all of the state except for Richland County).</p>

<p>At first blush, this seems like a decent system — better than most. Having an outside police agency investigate shootings by cops is certainly preferably to handling such investigations internally. But in my reporting for the series, I found that SLED isn’t as independent and elite as the agency is often portrayed. SLED is staffed with officers who come from other police agencies across the state, and often, SLED agents are assigned to investigate their former colleagues, a practice which critics in South Carolina told me means that in truth, the agency isn’t objective or independent at all.</p>

<p>Last week, I posted about new developments in the case of Julian Betton, a South Carolina man who was shot nine times, left paralyzed and nearly killed during a drug raid on his home over two pot sales totaling $100. The new developments raise yet more serious questions about SLED and the effectiveness of its investigations. I’ll lay all of that out in a minute. But first, here’s a quick summary of the criticisms of SLED I found in that series in 2015.</p>

<p>While several critics laid out the problems with SLED’s organizational structure and the way it assigns officers to shooting investigations, it was the actions of SLED investigators in specific cases that were most troubling. In the police shooting death of Lori Jean Ellis, for example, police officers broke into Ellis’s house over some unpaid fines and an open container violation, then shot her to death after claiming she pointed and fired a rifle at them. The officers described hearing a loud bang, then seeing a muzzle flash and smoke emanating from the barrel of the gun Ellis was allegedly holding. But as it turns out, the only gun in Ellis’s home was a pellet gun, which is incapable of producing a loud bang, a muzzle flash or smoke. The gun was also nonfunctional and wasn’t in her possession when the officers entered the home. Moreover, forensics investigators hired by Ellis’s estate plausibly argue that the trajectory of the bullets fired by the officers indicate that the incident couldn’t possibly have happened the way the police claim it did.</p>

<p>The SLED investigators didn’t probe any of these inconsistencies. The officers involved in the Ellis raid were also allowed to sit in a room together and confer before they were questioned. When an attorney for Ellis’s family asked one SLED investigator if these contradictions suggested that the officers weren’t telling the truth, he replied, “But they are telling the truth.” When asked how he could know that, he replied, “Because they’re police officers, and I believe what they’re telling me.” That officer, Paul Grant, has since been promoted and is now the assistant chief at SLED.</p>

<p>When another investigator, James Flowers, was asked why he didn’t ask the officers about the holes in their story, he replied, “I didn’t feel it necessary.” When pressed, he replied, “As the lead investigator for the state’s premiere law enforcement agency, it is my responsibility to put this case together. After looking at this information, I deemed that it was not necessary to interview that officer again. And that was the decision that I made.”</p>

<p>But Flowers, despite being the lead investigator, wasn’t aware of some crucial facts in the case, including that one bullet grazed Ellis’s shoulder, and he mistakenly thought one bullet had pierced Ellis’s door. (This was important, because the actual bullet holes suggested that the officers didn’t have a line of sight to Ellis herself, which casts doubt on their reports of seeing her fire a gun at them.) Most troubling, Flowers admitted that he hadn’t even read the forensics reports on the shooting — and that he typically didn’t read the full forensics reports in the cases he investigates.</p>

<p>In another police shooting death, that of Ernest Russell Jr., an anti-drug task force conducted a no-knock raid on Russell’s home for suspected misdemeanor gambling. According to the officers, they shot and killed Russell only after announcing themselves multiple times and demanding that he drop the gun he was holding. The officer who shot Russell stated that he warned Russell at least 14 times to drop his gun and show his hands. In between, he had time to scan the room. He mentioned seeing both the informant in the room and details from Russell’s gun. But in the body cam footage of the raid, only about 4.5 seconds pass from the time the police enter the house until Russell is shot. The audio picked up just one warning (an instruction to Russell to “get your hands up,” which suggests that the officer didn’t see Russell holding a gun). The camera was briefly out of earshot as the lead officer entered the house, but only for a couple seconds.</p>

<p>Here again, SLED investigators made no attempt to ask the officers about the clear discrepancy between the video and the police report. In fact, the report that SLED sent to the county solicitor (South Carolina’s equivalent of a district attorney) doesn’t even mention the word video. It does refer to the fact that one officer was wearing a body camera, but oddly implies that the camera only took still photos, and only captured portions of the interior of Russel’s home, not the critical moments leading up to the shooting.</p>

<p>In fact, it isn’t even clear that SLED investigators viewed the video. When an attorney for Russell’s family attempted to obtain the video, neither SLED nor the police agencies involved in the raid seemed to know where it was. The attorney finally contacted the officer who was wearing the camera, who then turned over the footage. In other words, as SLED investigated this shooting, one of the officers involved in the raid — and who, consequently, was also under investigation — was in possession of critical video footage of the entire incident. Despite the potential for litigation, once its investigation was complete, SLED never bothered to secure the footage from him. SLED’s report on the raid also refers to the police officers as “victims” and Russell as the “suspect.” That’s odd verbiage for an allegedly objective report, especially consider that Russell was shot to death, and was the only person injured in the incident.</p>

<p>There are lots of other examples in the series. Back in 2015, SLED did not respond to my queries or my request to interview Mark Keel, the head of the agency. After my series ran, Keel did give an interview to a local publication in which he made unspecified allegations about “inaccuracies,” dismissed my reporting as “misleading” and called it the work of someone who “believe[s] that law enforcement is somehow evil.” On a local blog, SLED investigator James Flowers called the series a “hit piece” and erroneously claimed that it was “written by a civil attorney.”</p>

<p>Let’s get back to the Julian Betton case. The members of the 15th Circuit Drug Enforcement Unit that raided Betton made a number of statements about the raid that were later proved false. Their claim that Betton fired a gun at them, for example, was refuted by forensics reports which found that the gun hadn’t been recently fired. The claim — made by nearly every member of the raid team — that they repeatedly knocked, announced and waited for an answer before forcibly entering Betton’s home also was disproved by surveillance video showing that they entered within seconds of arriving and that no one knocked on the door. The video also strongly suggests that if anyone did make an announcement, it was near-simultaneous with the battering ram hitting the door, or shortly after. Task force members also claimed they were wearing clothing that clearly indicated they were police. Here too, the video strongly suggests otherwise.</p>

<p>The SLED report on the Betton raid only briefly mentions the surveillance video. As in the Russell case, SLED investigators made no effort to press the task force members on why their police reports and statements to SLED investigators were directly contradicted by the video.</p>

<p>But this was all laid out in my series from last year (and well reported in local media). In my post last week, I noted a damning new report by a federal magistrate, supported by court filings, which shows that this particular narcotics task force routinely conducted illegal no-knock raids. One member of the task force erroneously claimed that there is no knock-and-announce requirement. Of course there is, unless the police specifically obtain a no-knock warrant, which task force members said they rarely bothered to do. Another task force member was completely off base on how long police must wait after knocking and announcing before entering a home. Still another said he had never been trained on the matter.</p>

<p>Worse, attorneys for Betton also discovered that the task force’s manual made no mention of how to serve search warrants. Warrant service is perhaps the most fraught and volatile undertaking of a drug enforcement unit. This unit has no set policies on when to obtain a no-knock warrant, what to wear during a raid, what team member should knock and announce, how long they should wait before entering, or even the tactical maneuvers the team should use upon entering. It was all ad hoc.</p>

<p>All of the new information I wrote about last week was discovered by Betton’s legal team. None of it was uncovered by SLED. So South Carolina’s premiere law enforcement agency, the agency entrusted to thoroughly and fairly investigate police shootings, looked into the Betton shooting. Its report on the raid was the impetus for South Carolina solicitor Kevin Bracket’s decision to clear the officers of any wrongdoing. And yet…</p>

<ul>
<li><p>SLED failed to note the clear contradictions between the surveillance footage and the officers’ statements, contradictions confirmed by both a federal magistrate and the Myrtle Beach chief of police.</p></li>

<li><p>SLED failed to note that the video shows the officers clearly violated the knock-and-announce rule.</p></li>

<li><p>SLED took at face value the officers’ claims that their clothing clearly indicated they were police, despite video evidence to the contrary.</p></li>

<li><p>SLED failed to ask the task force officers why nearly all of them claimed that they had knocked, announced and waited before entering, despite video footage showing that this wasn’t true.</p></li>

<li><p>SLED failed to ask why several officers claimed to have heard or seen Betton fire a gun at them, when ballistics testing shows that he hadn’t.</p></li>

<li><p>SLED investigators clearly did not ask the task force members if they understood the knock-and-announce rule, given that several of them do not.</p></li>

<li><p>SLED investigators either failed to discover or simply ignored the fact that the task force does not have a written policy for the service of search warrants.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Again, these aren’t trivial matters. They are the details that determine whether the raid itself was legal, whether Betton was justified in brandishing a weapon to defend himself and whether the officers were then justified in opening fire on him. You simply can’t determine whether this raid was legal, whether the police officers violated any laws and whether Betton’s civil rights were violated without this information. Yet SLED investigators appear to have made little to no effort to ascertain any of it. They simply interviewed the officers, the witnesses and Betton and left it at that. Bracket then based his decision to clear the officers on SLED’s report.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, according to deposition testimony from solicitor Jimmy Richardson, SLED itself has periodically had officers serve on the task force. (These task forces, which are often state and federally funded, are typically made up of police officers from several local jurisdictions, as well as occasional officers from state and even federal agencies.)</p>

<p>This raises two other important points. First, SLED was investigating a task force for which some of its agents have previously worked. Again, this calls the agency’s alleged independence into question. Second, and more importantly, if Richardson is correct, SLED agents worked on a narcotics task force that routinely violated the Fourth Amendment. SLED agents also worked on a task force that had no written policy for serving search warrants. Those problems were never relayed back to SLED. And SLED investigators were still unable to discover those problems even after the task force shot and nearly killed a man. Somehow, investigators for Betton were able to discover critical details about this unit that SLED overlooked, even as some of its own agents worked with the unit. That would seem to raise some questions about the agency’s elite and esteemed reputation.</p>

<p>I reached out to SLED again before writing this post. A spokesperson responded via email:</p>

<p>As the agency that investigated the case, we may be called upon to provide testimony in this civil proceeding. It would be inappropriate to discuss any specifics while the civil action is open. We decline your request. </p>

<p>It’s worth noting that in the past, SLED has also ignored or refused my requests to discuss cases that are closed and no longer in litigation.</p>

<p>In the past, SLED officials have said that their task in investigating police shootings is merely to gather evidence, not to make pronouncements on whether police shootings are justified. That’s true. The ultimate decision is made by the state’s solicitors. But the solicitors’ decisions are based on the SLED reports. And if the SLED reports don’t probe inconsistencies, contradictions and outright lies in police accounts, the solicitors aren’t making fully informed decisions.</p>

<p>SLED officials also insist they only investigate whether police officers committed a crime — that the agency doesn’t look into whether someone’s civil rights were violated, whether shootings could have been prevented, or whether changes to policies or tactics could prevent more shootings from occurring. But in my original series, I found that if a SLED report finds no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, many police agencies in the state view that report as complete vindication. Clearly, there’s a disconnect here.</p>

<p>In the end, all else being equal, having police shootings investigated by an outside law enforcement agency is certainly preferable to having them investigated internally. But that agency must be truly impartial and independent. When the oversight agency has only the appearance of integrity and impartiality, the result is not only the papering over of injustices but also the entire state is then imbued with a false sense of security about how the state’s police agencies actually operate. Faux accountability is more destructive than no accountability at all.</p>

<p>Police advocates often cite incidents such as the Betton raid and this particular task force’s routine Fourth Amendment violations as little more than a few “bad apples” in a profession otherwise populated by honest, hard-working police officers. Perhaps that’s true. Perhaps most police officers do fall into the latter category. But when the bad actors aren’t held accountable — indeed, when they’re validated by oversight agencies — the problem isn’t just a few bad actors. The problem is systemic.</p>

<h2 id="makingamurdererfalseconfessionsandbadexperttestimony">‘Making a Murderer,’ false confessions and bad expert testimony</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/06/13/making-a-murderer-false-confessions-and-bad-expert-testimony/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Brendan Dassey appears at the Manitowoc County Courthouse in Manitowoc, Wis., in April 2007. (Dan Powers/The Post-Crescent/Pool)</p>

<p>Over at the New York Times, Adam Liptak writes about the possibility of the U.S. Supreme Court taking up the case of Brendan Dassey, the 16-year-old whose interrogation and confession were included in the Netflix series “Making a Murderer.” Dassey’s attorneys argue that his confession should have been suppressed, citing the way both Dassey and his mother were manipulated and basically bullied by interrogators, as well as emerging evidence that juveniles are especially prone to false confessions, especially under harsh questioning.</p>

<p>The Wisconsin Supreme Court disagreed and upheld Dassey’s conviction. But a federal district court judge and a panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit found that the confession should have been suppressed. The full 7th Circuit then reversed again. That’s where the case stands today.</p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court could simply decide not to hear the case, in which case Dassey’s conviction would stand. They could also uphold the conviction on the grounds that the 7th Circuit did, finding that his claims aren’t compelling enough to get him past the 1996 law (commonly known as AEDPA) that limits when federal courts can review state court rulings. In other words, the court may not delve much into the issue of false confessions among juveniles, and find instead that this is an issue that, under that 1996 law, should be left to state courts to decide.</p>

<p>In our new book, my co-author and I look at a case that I think provides a pretty vivid illustration of why this shouldn’t be an issue left to the state courts. Tyler Edmonds was just 13 when he was accused of killing his sister’s husband. According to prosecutors, Edmonds and his sister waited until the victim was asleep, then the two both held a gun and simultaneously pulled the trigger, killing the man. Edmonds would later say that his sister confessed to him, but urged him to take the blame, and claim that he accidentally fired the gun while playing with it. Since he was a juvenile, she said, they’d go easy on him. If she was convicted, she told him they’d send her to the electric chair.</p>

<p>During his initial questioning, Edmonds denied any role in the murder. But he was later separated from his mother. At one point, he was put in a room with his sister, who slipped him a note again urging him to confess, or she’d be given the death penalty. After that, Edmonds confessed. But his confession wasn’t consistent with the crime scene, or with other facts known to police. And he confessed in a way that didn’t completely take full responsibility for the crime — it was Edmonds who first laid out the two-people-holding-the-gun theory. Three days later, after talking to his mother and other relatives, Edmonds retracted the entire confession, explaining that he thought if he took partial responsibility, he’d save his sister from execution.</p>

<p>As it turns out, Edmonds’s confession raised a number of red flags. He wasn’t just a minor; he was just 13. He was questioned outside the presence of a parent. He was emotionally and psychologically immature for his age. He also adored his sister, making him more susceptible to her manipulation. Edmonds also confessed in a way that minimized his role in the crime. His confession wasn’t consistent with the facts of the case. And he quickly and completely retracted. All of these are common indicators in a false confession. The defense was prepared to call an expert witness to testify to all of this. But prosecutors objected, and asked for a hearing (known as a Daubert hearing) on the scientific validity of expert testimony about false confessions. The trial judge granted a daylong hearing on the question before ultimately deciding that the research in support of the idea that juveniles can be pressured into false confessions wasn’t scientifically reliable. Edmonds’s expert would not be permitted to testify.</p>

<p>The judge first did what judges often do in these situations. He looked at what other judges had done. He found that about half the courts that ruled on the matter had ruled against allowing such testimony in. Thus, he concluded, the notion of false confessions had yet to be accepted in the scientific community. But how judges have ruled on a challenge to expert testimony is quite a bit different than what science says about the matter. And in fact, more than a decade before Edmonds’s trial, a review of peer-reviewed research on the matter found more than 800 published reports in support of the idea that false confessions do indeed occur. And as former Mississippi Supreme Court justice Oliver Diaz would later point out in a concurring opinion, while the trial judge claimed that only six people were researching the issue at the time, in fact more than 60 authors had published on the topic. In support of his opinion to exclude the testimony, the judge cited just three experts. One of them had never published a peer-reviewed study on the topic. Another was former federal judge Paul Cassell, who is not a psychiatrist or psychiatric researcher, but a partisan legal pundit and longtime victims’ rights advocate.</p>

<p>If that all wasn’t bad enough, the state also put on its own scientifically dubious evidence. As the prosecutor told jurors in her opening statement, “You’re going to hear how Kristi stood behind him and held him and you’re going to hear how they both put their finger on the trigger and you’re going to hear how they both shot and killed Joey Fulgham.”</p>

<p>That’s an extraordinary claim that would be nearly impossible to prove. Yet the state tried, with the controversial, longtime Mississippi medical examiner Steven Hayne. When asked whether the wounds in Fulgham’s body were consistent with Edmonds’s confession (as opposed to his retraction), Hayne replied, “Within a reasonable medical certainty, it’s consistent with the scenario provided to me.” That, of course, would be the scenario in which two people fired the gun. Asked later to clarify — was he really claiming that the bullet holes suggested there were two people holding the gun that fired the bullets? — Hayne replied, “I would favor that a second party be involved in that positioning of the weapon.”</p>

<p>This, of course, is nonsense. There’s simply no way a medical examiner can look at bullet holes and know how many people were holding the gun that fired those bullets. Edmonds’s attorneys rightly objected and requested a Daubert hearing of their own. Incredibly, the trial judge — the same judge that granted a daylong hearing after which he ultimately refused to allow in expert testimony about false confessions — wouldn’t even grant a hearing on the scientific validity of the two-people-holding-the-gun theory. So that’s what the jury heard. And it convicted Edmonds.</p>

<p>Edmonds appealed and lost at the Mississippi Court of Appeals. He then appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court. He lost there too, at least at first. The justices initially voted to uphold his conviction. But after Diaz wrote a blistering dissent excoriating his fellow justices, they voted again and came down 6-3 in favor of overturning the conviction because of Hayne’s testimony. That in itself was noteworthy — it was the first time in two decades of cases that they had tossed out the testimony of the now-discredited medical examiner. But the majority also ruled that the trial judge was right to exclude the false confession testimony, finding that it “couldn’t be empirically tested.” (Never mind that courts routinely allow all sorts of expert testimony that can’t be “empirically tested,” including most fields of forensics.)</p>

<p>Edmonds was tried again. Without the dubious forensic testimony, he was quickly acquitted. Remarkably, the state later accepted his false confession argument in an attempt to prevent Edmonds from being compensated for his wrongful conviction. The state argued that because his confession was “manufactured evidence,” he had aided in his own conviction. Under state law, he was therefore ineligible for compensation.</p>

<p>According to the defense attorneys I’ve talked to in Mississippi, the portion of the Mississippi Supreme Court’s Edmonds decision dealing with false confessions is the most recent such decision from that court. This means that any defendant who wants to introduce expert testimony on false confessions would face an uphill battle, given the court’s line about about empirical testing.</p>

<p>AEDPA was a bad law for a lot of reasons. But its limitations on federal review of state court decisions might be the biggest one.</p>

<h2 id="behindthescenesprosecutorlobbieswieldimmensepower">Behind the scenes, prosecutor lobbies wield immense power</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-22</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/04/23/behind-the-scenes-prosecutor-lobbies-wield-immense-power/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Over at In Justice Today, Josie Duffy Rice takes a look at the powerful state prosecutor lobby, which has scuttled criminal justice reform efforts across the country.</p>

<p>Just a few months ago, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo seemed sure that criminal justice reform was imminent. During his annual State of the State address in January, he called for a legislative package that would limit civil asset forfeiture, reform discovery, reduce trial delays, and most notably, significantly reduce the use of cash bail. “For far too long, our antiquated criminal justice system has created a two-tier system where outcomes depend purely on economic status — undermining the bedrock principle that one is innocent until proven guilty,” Cuomo said. …</p>

<p>Until late March, it looked as if significant change might move forward. But then, suddenly, it was over. The budget, signed earlier this month and primarily negotiated in private by the governor and just three powerful legislators, did not include the criminal justice reforms Cuomo so adamantly supported just weeks ago. Despite what he said to Akeem, the budget doesn’t fund bail reform at all. …</p>

<p>Whose fault is it that criminal justice reform failed in New York? While there’s plenty of blame to go around — a corrupt legislature, Cuomo’s craven maneuvering, the bail bond lobby — there’s one behind-the-scenes player whose influence gets little attention: the District Attorney’s Association of the State of New York (DAASNY).</p>

<p>DAASNY has been shaping criminal justice legislation in New York for over a century. The association’s membership includes all 62 elected district attorneys in the state, as well as many assistant prosecutors. In many ways DAASNY is like any other professional organization: It holds trainings, hosts conferences, and issues a newsletter. But its enormous leverage in the state legislature makes it uncommonly powerful. DAASNY largely serves as a lobbying group — and a very effective one.</p>

<p>Rice tells similar stories from other states, such as how the prosecutor lobby in Alabama defeated a civil asset forfeiture reform bill, despite overwhelming support from Alabama voters and interest groups from across the political spectrum. In California, a prosecutors’ group stalled bail reform. In Arizona, a group is pushing for tougher drug sentences and fighting forfeiture and bail reforms. In Indiana, they’re fighting marijuana decriminalization. And in Nebraska, a group fought against checks on the use of jailhouse informants.</p>

<p>It’s particularly bothersome when these groups lobby with taxpayer money, either directly or indirectly. As I reported here at The Watch last year, that appears to be the case with the Louisiana District Attorneys Association (LDAA), whose chief lobbyist — a prosecutor named Hugo Holland who was forced to resign as assistant district attorney for Caddo Parish several years ago — appears to be paid with public funds from one or more of the state’s parishes. But it can also happen indirectly, such as when prosecutors lobby legislatures themselves while they’re on the clock. As one reform activist put it, if public defenders were using taxpayer dollars to lobby for shorter sentences, it would be on the front page of every newspaper. But these prosecutor groups get away with it, I guess because they’re seen by lawmakers more as knowledgeable policy experts than partisan interest groups. But that they always seem to come down on the side of longer sentences, less leniency and more punitiveness ought to call such assumptions into question.</p>

<p>Rice closes by noting that the Louisiana legislature recently considered two bills that would have held the state’s prosecutors more accountable. If you read this page at all regularly, you know that Louisiana is one of the worst states in the country when it comes to prosecutor misconduct. The state’s defense attorneys and their assistants have a long history of Brady violations, including in death-sentence cases, and it it has one of the highest wrongful conviction rates in America. Rice notes that after opposition from the LDAA, neither bill made it out of committee.</p>

<p>Hugo Holland in Lake Charles, La., in August 2016. (Scott Clause/The Daily Advertiser/AP)</p>

<p>Last year here at The Watch, we posted a long investigation of Hugo Holland, a fired Louisiana prosecutor who found a second career as a sort of freelance prosecutor in death-penalty cases. In fact, he has more than doubled his old salary as an assistant district attorney by working as a hired gun all over the state. One of the cases in that piece was that of Corey Williams, an intellectually disabled man who appears to have been framed for a murder that was committed when he was 16. Lawyers for Williams have alleged that Holland withheld quite a bit of exculpatory evidence from Williams’ defense team.</p>

<p>Having lost in state court, Williams’ lawyers are now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear his case. They are joined by 44 former prosecutors and Justice Department officials who signed on to Williams’ petition, including Michael Mukasey, who served as the attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.</p>

<p>Witnesses saw several older men steal money and pizza from [Jarvis] Griffin and saw Williams running from the house alone with nothing in his hands after the shooting, according to his lawyers. One of the older men, Chris Moore, was the only witness who identified Williams as the shooter.</p>

<p>Fingerprints found on the murder weapon belonged to one of the other older men, and the victim’s blood was found on clothing worn by a third older man, according to Williams’ lawyers.</p>

<p>Police officers found Williams hiding under a sheet on a couch at his grandmother’s house. He initially denied killing Griffin but changed his story after police questioned him through the night.</p>

<p>“His confession was brief, devoid of corroborating details,” his lawyers wrote in their March 2 petition to the Supreme Court. “Having just assumed responsibility for a homicide, Corey told the officers, ‘I’m tired. I’m ready to go home and lay down.'”</p>

<p>Williams’ lawyers say his conviction was based primarily on that confession and the testimony of Moore. Only after Williams’ trial did his attorneys obtain recordings of witness interviews pointing to his innocence. The withheld recordings showed police had suspected the older men were plotting to frame Williams for the killing, according to Williams’ lawyers.</p>

<p>As I pointed out last year, this case seems especially egregious because Holland, at one point, told the jury that for the other teens to have conspired to implicate Williams would have amounted to the greatest conspiracy since the killing of President John F. Kennedy. (Make of that what you will, I guess.) Except the tapes the state was sitting on appear to show that even the police thought that was exactly what was happening.</p>

<p>Williams was originally sentenced to death. That sentence was changed to life in prison after Williams’ lawyers demonstrated his disability, which they say comes from lead poisoning during his childhood. Holland opposed removing the death sentence, too.</p>

<p>(Mark Ralston/Agence France-Presse/Getty Images)</p>

<p>Like a lot of other doctors, child welfare advocates and forensic specialists, John Plunkett at first bought into the theory of Shaken Baby Syndrome (SBS). This is the theory that an autopsy on a young, recently deceased child reveals three symptoms — bleeding in the back of the eyes, brain swelling, and bleeding in the subdural space just above the brain — those injuries could only have been caused by violent shaking. The diagnosis gained popularity in the 1990s, then became more common still after the high-profile trial and conviction of British nanny Louise Woodward in 1997.</p>

<p>It’s a convenient diagnosis for prosecutors, in that it provides a cause of death (violent shaking), a culprit (whoever was last with the child before death) and even intent (prosecutors often argue that the violent, extended shaking establishes mens rea.) According to a 2015 survey by The Washington Post and the Medill Justice Project, there were about 1,800 SBS prosecutions between 2001 and 2015, with 1,600 resulting in convictions.</p>

<p>But in the late 1990s, Plunkett — a forensic pathologist in Minnesota — began to have doubts about the diagnosis. He started investigating cases in which children had died in a manner similar to the way accused caregivers had described the deaths of the children they were watching — by short-distance falls. What he found alarmed him. In 2001, Plunkett published a study detailing how he had found symptoms similar to those in the SBS diagnosis in children who had fallen off playground equipment. It was a landmark study. If a short-distance fall could produce symptoms similar to those in SBS cases, the SBS diagnosis that said symptoms could only come from shaking was wrong. By that point, hundreds of people had been convicted based on SBS testimony from medical experts. Some of them were undoubtedly guilty. But if Plunkett was right, some of them almost certainly weren’t.</p>

<p>Content from Prime Video</p>

<p>Naturally, defense attorneys began asking Plunkett to testify. He obliged. The same year his study was published, Plunkett testified in the trial of Lisa Stickney, a licensed day care worker in Oregon. She had been charged with murder for the death of a young boy in her care. According to Stickney, she was in another room when she heard a thud. She rushed over and found the boy on the floor near an overturned chair, with blood coming from his head. But according to prosecutors, an autopsy showed the boy had the symptoms that conventional wisdom held could only have come from violent shaking. Thanks in large part to Plunkett’s testimony, Stickney was acquitted.</p>

<p>The acquittal was another landmark moment in the SBS story. Plunkett was now a threat to SBS cases all over the country. The office of Deschutes County, Ore., District Attorney Michael Dugan responded with something unprecedented — it criminally charged an expert witness over testimony he had given in court. One of the state’s experts also filed an ethics complaint against Stickney’s other expert witness. The actual charges were filed by ssociate District Attorney Cliff Lu — four counts of “false swearing,” a misdemeanor charge related to perjury. Dugan’s office also contacted other prosecutors across the country to tell them that Plunkett was under criminal investigation. It was a pretty obvious effort to silence him — to prevent him from testifying in other cases. No defense attorney was about to call a witness if they jury would also learn that he was facing criminal charges over testimony he had given in court.</p>

<p>Because the charges stemmed from Plunkett’s testimony in an SBS case prosecuted by Dugan’s office, he and his assistants were eventually forced to withdraw from the case. The charges were then picked up by the office of the Oregon Attorney General. Perhaps this was just a reach by a rogue DA’s office. Perhaps once the state attorney general and his staff of professionals reviewed the case, they’d see the charges for the farce that they were. Nope. Oregon assistant Attorney General Eric Wasmann took up the case and brought Plunkett to trial.</p>

<p>I’ve been covering the forensics and the criminal justice system for 12 years. There have been some really bad expert witnesses to take the stand in U.S. courts. More than a few of them have been the main reason why an innocent person went to prison — and even to death row. I can only think of a couple of instances in which the expert was criminally prosecuted, and those cases were only after overwhelming evidence of really egregious misconduct, such as faking test results. The charges against Plunkett were about inconsequential details for which the worst possible explanation was simply that Plunkett had misremembered. Half the charges were dropped before trial. A judge acquitted him on the other two.</p>

<p>One of the remaining charges involved another expert witness named Mary Case. She was an ardent supporter of the SBS diagnosis. Plunkett was asked in court if he had ever participated in another trial in which Case was involved. He replied that to his knowledge he hadn’t. It turns out he had. But this was a man who testified in court many, many times. He had often been asked about Case’s work, even if she wasn’t testifying for the other side. That’s an incredibly petty inaccuracy on which to pursue criminal charges. Plunkett had little to gain by deliberately giving a false answer to that question. Even Case herself — who again, believed Plunkett was wrong about SBS — told the ABA Journal in 2005, “I felt it was kind of a petty charge and I didn’t want to be involved . . . his liberty or his livelihood could be lost for saying something slightly incorrect.” Asked why an expert witness like Plunkett could be facing criminal charges, Case responded that he must have “angered the prosecutor.”</p>

<p>Today, the scientific consensus on SBS has since shifted significantly in Plunkett’s direction. In 2015, the Post asked biomechanical engineer Chris Van Ee to measure the acceleration to the head produced by shaking versus that of a short-distance fall. Van Ee’s experiments found that the falls produced orders of magnitude more acceleration. Other researchers have found that other conditions ranging from bacterial infections to genetic conditions can produce symptoms to those commonly associated with SBS. Even the man who helped introduced the theory behind SBS now says the science is in doubt and has called for a review of SBS cases.</p>

<p>According to the National Registry of Exonerations, 16 SBS convictions have been overturned. Plunkett’s obituary puts the figure at 300, and claims that he participated in 50 of those cases. I’m not sure of the source for that figure, and it’s the first I’ve seen of it. But whatever the number, Plunkett deserves credit for being among the first to sound the alarm about wrongful SBS convictions. His study was the first step toward those exonerations.</p>

<p>Someone like Plunkett may not be the first person to come to mind when we think about whistleblowers, but that’s exactly what he was. I doubt he could have anticipated the unhinged reaction to his study and testimony — who could? But even after the criminal case and attacks on his credibility, he continued to speak out about SBS, and he continued to testify. In addition to the criminal charges, he also had to beat back ethics complaints, as have other SBS skeptics in both the United States and Europe. He certainly didn’t get rich from his heresy — one defense attorney interviewed by the ABA Journal pointed out that Plunkett often didn’t charge for his testimony.</p>

<p>Plunkett has bascially been vindicated in the years since his trial. What about the people who went after him? According to his LinkedIn profile, Eric Wassman is now a circuit court judge pro tem. As of February, Cliff Lu was still an assistant district attorney in Deschutes County. Former DA Michael Dugan was soundly defeated in 2010 after 23 years in office, and amid allegations of sexual discrimination and possible wrongful convictions. Dugan appears to have since joined the Malheur County, Ore., DA’s office as an assistant district attorney, where in 2014 he was pursuing a racketeering case against two men for selling medical marijuana. In 2015, Deschutes County endured another forensics scandal — county officials revealed that as many as 1,500 drug cases may have been tainted by a corrupt crime lab analyst.</p>

<p>John Plunkett died last week after a long battle with cancer. He was 70 years old. He ought to be remembered alongside people like John Edland, Michael Bowers and Mary and Peter Bush, and Emily Ward — people who tried to sound the alarm about dubious forensics, and were attacked and pilloried for doing so.</p>

<p>And among the wrongly accused whom Plunkett’s advocacy helped to free, I can only imagine that he’ll be remembered as a hero.</p>

<h2 id="theongoingmythsandmisconceptionsaboutaccidentaladdiction">The ongoing myths and misconceptions about ‘accidental addiction’</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>Oxycodone pills (John Moore/Getty Images)</p>

<p>Over at Reason, Jacob Sullum has written a much-needed corrective to the prevailing narrative about opioid addiction — that there is a widespread problem of “accidental addiction” among pain patients. It’s a destructive narrative, because it makes it more difficult for people in real pain to find doctors willing to treat them.</p>

<p>Contrary to the impression left by most press coverage of the issue, opioid-related deaths do not usually involve drug-naive patients who accidentally get hooked while being treated for pain. Instead, they usually involve people with histories of substance abuse and psychological problems who use multiple drugs, not just opioids . . .</p>

<p>But the truth is that patients who take opioids for pain rarely become addicted. A 2018 study found that just 1 percent of people who took prescription pain medication following surgery showed signs of “opioid misuse,” a broader category than addiction. Even when patients take opioids for chronic pain, only a small minority of them become addicted. The risk of fatal poisoning is even lower—on the order of two-hundredths of a percent annually, judging from a 2015 study.</p>

<p>Despite such reassuring numbers, the government is responding to the “opioid epidemic” as if opioid addiction were a disease caused by exposure to opioids, a simplistic view that ignores the personal, social, and economic factors that make these drugs attractive to some people. Treating pain medication as a disease vector, the government has restricted access to it by monitoring prescriptions, investigating doctors, and imposing new limits on how much can be prescribed, for how long, and under what circumstances. That approach hurts pain patients by depriving them of the analgesics they need to make their lives livable, and it hurts nonmedical users by driving them into a black market where the drugs are deadlier.</p>

<p>A large majority of opioid-related deaths now involve illicitly produced substances, primarily heroin and fentanyl. As usual, the government’s efforts to get between people and the drugs they want have not prevented drug use, but they have made it more dangerous.</p>

<p>And more data:</p>

<p>According to a 2014 analysis of data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 54 percent of nonmedical users got prescription opioids for free from friends or relatives. Another 16 percent bought or stole pills from friends or relatives, while 4 percent bought them from strangers. About 6 percent mentioned other sources, including online purchases, forged prescriptions, and theft from doctors’ offices or pharmacies. Just 20 percent of nonmedical users said they obtained opioids through prescriptions written for them.</p>

<p>Although some people who now obtain opioids indirectly may have had prescriptions at some point, these results undercut the notion that nonmedical users typically start as bona fide patients. Even among the heaviest users, just 27 percent had prescriptions at the time of the survey, and it is not clear how many of those were legitimate at the outset. In most cases, says Sidney Schnoll, a physician specializing in addiction and pain treatment who works for the consulting firm Pinney Associates, “These are people who were drug-seeking. They are not people who went to a physician, got a prescription, and suddenly became addicted to the drug.”</p>

<p>. . . A study reported in The BMJ this year tracked 568,612 opioid-naive patients who took prescription pain medication following surgery and found that 5,906, or 1 percent, showed signs of “opioid misuse” during the course of the study, which included data from 2008 through 2016. Although some studies have described “rates of misuse, abuse, and addiction-related aberrant behaviors” as high as 26 percent among chronic pain patients, Volkow and McLellan reported, “rates of carefully diagnosed addiction” average less than 8 percent.</p>

<p>Fatal overdoses among patients are even rarer. A 2015 study reported in the journal PLOS One followed chronic pain patients treated with narcotics for up to 13 years and found that one in 550 died from an opioid-related overdose, which is a risk of less than 0.2 percent over the course of the study. A 2015 study of opioid-related deaths in North Carolina, reported in Pain Medicine, found 478 fatalities among 2.2 million residents who were prescribed opioids in 2010, an annual rate of 0.022 percent.</p>

<p>Despite what you may have read elsewhere, the Drug Enforcement Administration hasn’t exactly been going easy on doctors who overprescribe. In the 1990s and 2000s, the agency targeted lots of doctors with highly publicized investigations. (I know this because I wrote about some of them.) The intent of these investigations — and the news conferences and media releases that went with them — was to scare doctors away from prescribing opioids. It worked. A lot of competent and conscientious doctors left pain treatment.</p>

<p>But the pain their patients were experiencing didn’t go away. The demand for relief persisted. Unfortunately, but not at all surprisingly, that demand was filled by less scrupulous, less careful “pill mill” doctors willing to write prescriptions for addicts and legitimate patients alike, with about the same amount of care and attention for either. (The government and anti-opioid interests also tend to conflate addiction with dependence, which is a separate problem. Diabetics, for example, are dependent on insulin. They aren’t addicted to it.)</p>

<p>The basic problem here is that drug cops shouldn’t be dictating medical policy. If doctors are overprescribing, medical licensure boards should intervene. But as we saw for decades with the medical use of marijuana, when it comes to controlled substances, drug warriors don’t see nuance. They tend to view intoxicating drugs with a Puritan fervor. The research suggests that one way to get more people off opioid painkillers, for example, would be to ensure better access to medical marijuana. The current U.S. attorney general isn’t having that. He advises people suffering from chronic pain to take an aspirin instead.</p>

<p>We need rational, evidence-based opioid policy that balances the the medical needs of people in pain with the government’s interest in preventing addiction and overdose deaths. Right now, the latter is dominating the debate. Worse, it’s not at all clear that limiting access to prescription opioids actually prevents addiction and overdose.</p>

<h2 id="manshotat57timesduringraidoverd100potsalegetsd275millionsettlement">Man shot at 57 times during raid over $100 pot sale gets $2.75 million settlement</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-26</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/03/27/man-shot-at-57-times-during-raid-over-100-pot-sale-gets-2-75-million-settlement/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>I first wrote about Julian Betton’s case in my 2016 series on policing in South Carolina. Betton was raided by a multi-jurisdictional narcotics task force after a police informant bought $50 worth of marijuana from him two times. The police broke down Betton’s door with a battering ram, then fired at least 57 bullets at him, hitting him nine times. He lost portions of his gallbladder, colon, bowel and rectum, and is paralyzed from the waist down. He also suffered damage to his liver, lung, small intestine and pancreas. Two of his vertebrae were damaged, and another was partially destroyed. Another bullet shattered his leg.</p>

<p>In their remarkably consistent after-action reports and interviews, members of the raid team initially claimed they fired only after Betton shot at them first. They had to change that narrative when the crime lab revealed that Betton’s gun hadn’t been fired. They then claimed they opened fire when he pointed his gun at them. They claimed he had no right to do so because — again in remarkably similar, almost word-for-word descriptions — they knocked and announced themselves repeatedly before breaking down his door. Several of the officers were wearing body cameras. Those cameras might have shown us whether members of the raid team had indeed knocked and announced themselves several times before smashing Betton’s door with a battering ram. But curiously, all the raid team members who were wearing body cameras neglected to activate them prior to the raid. Curiouser still, they all did activate their cameras after the raid went down, and after Betton lay in his own home, bloodied and nearly dead.</p>

<p>He was placed under arrest at the hospital where he was recovering, and charged for the marijuana and for pointing a gun at police officers. He woke from his coma handcuffed to his hospital bed.</p>

<p>What the police didn’t know is that Betton had a security camera. There’s no audio, but the camera clearly shows that the police almost certainly didn’t knock and announce at all before smashing down Betton’s door. At most, it’s at least possible that one officer knocked or announced, though it seems unlikely that there was time to do both. The raid team members also all claimed that the first officers into Betton’s home were wearing clothing that clearly indicated they were police. Betton’s video shows that this, too, was a lie.</p>

<p>The raid and the shooting of Betton were then reviewed by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), the state police agency that reviews nearly all of the state’s police shootings. Incredibly, despite having access to the security camera footage, SLED investigators found no wrongdoing on the part of the raid team. Worse, the SLED report didn’t even attempt to explain the significant discrepancies between the footage and the well-rehearsed police reports.</p>

<p>Last year, prosecutors dropped the gun charges against Betton, a pretty good indication that they were convinced either that he never pointed his gun at the raiding cops or, more likely, that the cops didn’t properly knock and announce themselves, in which case he had every right to point a gun at them, at least until he realized they were police officers.</p>

<p>Now, officers from two police agencies that participate in the task force as well as the prosecutor’s office that oversees the unit have settled with Betton for $2.75 million. That, too, seems to be a good indication that town officials know that this raid team messed up, and messed up pretty badly. The city of Myrtle Beach did not participate in the settlement, so Betton’s lawsuit against that city and the officer from the city police department who was involved in the raid will continue.</p>

<p>The main focus of my 2016 series on policing in South Carolina was how deficient SLED appears to be at investigating police shootings. The agency is widely thought to be the most elite law enforcement outfit in the state. Yet my review of shootings found that SLED investigators routinely failed to investigate contradictions and falsehoods in police reports, often made little effort to follow up when police accounts of a shooting were directly contradicted by video or forensic evidence, and sometimes failed to even mention those contradictions. One SLED investigator admitted under oath that he doesn’t even read forensics and crime lab reports. Another said he didn’t bother following up on contradictions between crime lab reports and police reports in an officer-involved shooting “because they’re police officers and I believe what they’re telling me.”</p>

<p>The really troubling thing about all of this is that because SLED is an outside police agency, and because it is viewed as elite, when investigators from the agency clear cops for shootings, they come with a great deal of cachet and credibility. Or at least perceived credibility. And an outside investigation that’s perceived as credible and unbiased, but is actually neither, is arguably more destructive to good policing and good government than not handing the investigation over to an outside agency at all.</p>

<p>After my series ran, SLED chief Mark Keel gave an interview to Statehouse Report in which he made unspecified allegations that the series was “inaccurate” and “misleading,” and dismissed my reporting as the work of someone who wants “to believe that law enforcement is somehow evil.”</p>

<p>Let’s go back to the Betton case. SLED cleared the raid team without noting that the task force members’ reports of the raid appear to have been coordinated and rehearsed, and that those coordinated, rehearsed reports were initially wrong about Betton firing his gun and about the raid team’s attire, and in claiming that members of the raid team repeatedly knocked and announced themselves. Yet local prosecutors didn’t believe there was sufficient evidence that Betton had pointed his gun at the raid team to charge him for doing so. And here’s the thing: If Betton didn’t point his gun, the raid team had no justification to shoot at him 57 times.</p>

<p>Now, officials in two jurisdictions and the local prosecutor’s office seem to believe that the raid team messed up badly enough that they’re willing to pay Betton $2.75 million — which suggests that they think there’s a good chance that a jury would have awarded Betton quite a bit more. It’s difficult to get a jury to rule against police officers, even in really egregious cases. So whoever decided on this settlement undoubtedly concluded that the raid team’s actions were about as bad as it gets.</p>

<p>So the city and local officials outside of SLED who have reviewed this case seem to have reached conclusions that are starkly different from the SLED investigators’ conclusions. But because the SLED investigators found no wrongdoing by the raid team, the only party who will be punished for the damage done to Julian Betton’s body will be South Carolina’s taxpayers.</p>

<p>In 2009, a Mississippi jury convicted Christopher Brandon of killing his girlfriend’s 15-month-old son. Brandon claimed that the boy fell off a bed and struck his head on a toy, but the state’s expert witness, a controversial medical examiner named Steven Hayne, testified that the child had the symptoms of shaken baby syndrome (SBS).</p>

<p>At the time of Brandon’s trial, SBS was already highly contentious. It emerged as a popular diagnosis in the late ’90s and early 2000s, particularly after the high-profile conviction of British au pair Louise Woodward in 1997. Forensic pathologists and child advocates claimed that if a trio of specific symptoms were present in a deceased child — bleeding at the back of the eye, bleeding in the protective area of the brain, brain swelling — the child could have died only from violent shaking. But scientists had begun expressing doubts, and studies were showing that the same symptoms can be caused by infections, genetic conditions and short falls.</p>

<p>Brandon’s attorney asked the court for funds to hire his own expert. The court refused, so the jury heard only from Hayne, the state’s expert, who testified that the child had died from shaking. He pointed to a textbook that, he said, debunked the criticism of SBS. The textbook actually said the opposite. Hayne then cited a study that doesn’t appear to exist. Brandon was sentenced to life in prison. When his attorneys filed an appeal questioning the SBS diagnosis and the syndrome itself and pointing out the discrepancies in the state’s case, the Mississippi attorney general said Hayne must have been referring to one of two conferences on SBS — both of which took place after Brandon’s trial . (Disclosure: Tucker Carrington’s office represents Brandon.) A 2013 study by the Medill Justice Project at Northwestern University estimated that SBS played a role in about 3,000 convictions.</p>

<p>Since the onset in the 1990s of DNA testing — which, unlike most fields of forensics, was born in the scientific community — we’ve learned that many forensic specialities aren’t nearly as accurate as their practitioners have claimed. Studies from the National Academy of Sciences and the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology have concluded that there’s insufficient research to support the claims of the broad field of “pattern matching” forensics, which includes analyses of such things as hair fiber, bite marks, “tool marks” and tire tread.</p>

<p>These forensic specialties were never subjected to the rigors of scientific inquiry — double-blind testing, peer review — before they were accepted in courtrooms. Most are entirely subjective: An analyst will look at two marks or patterns and determine whether they’re a “match.” Most of these disciplines can’t even calculate a margin of error.</p>

<p>The scientific process is slow and deliberate: A study is published. Other studies verify, contradict or refine its results. There’s no set point at which science declares a theory proven or disproven. It’s about the process itself and the gradual accumulation of knowledge.</p>

<p>Courts work under a different set of rules. Statutes of limitations toll, procedural rules impose deadlines, and there’s an emphasis on finality. With science, revision and correction are part of the process — it’s okay to be wrong. The criminal justice system tends to operate as if its very legitimacy requires the certainty of a closed tomb.</p>

<p>At the trial level, juries hear far too much dubious science, whether it’s an unproven field like bite mark matching or blood splatter analysis, exaggerated claims in a field like hair fiber analysis, or analysts testifying outside their area of expertise. It’s difficult to say how many convictions have involved faulty or suspect forensics, but the FBI estimated in 2015 that its hair fiber analysts had testified in about 3,000 cases — and that’s merely one subspecialty of forensics, and only at the federal level. Extrapolating from the database of DNA exonerations, the Innocence Project estimates that bad forensics contributes to about 45 percent of wrongful convictions.</p>

<p>But flawed evidence presented at trial is only part of the problem. Even once a field of forensics or a particular expert has been discredited, the courts have made it extremely difficult for those convicted by bad science to get a new trial.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court makes judges responsible for determining what is good science. They already decide what evidence is allowed at trial, so asking them to do the same for expert testimony may seem intuitive. But judges are trained to do legal analyses, not scientific ones. They generally deal with challenges to expert testimony by looking at what other judges have said. If a previous court has allowed a field of forensic evidence, subsequent courts will, too.</p>

<p>The history of bite mark jurisprudence shows how poorly the courts scrutinize expert testimony. The 1975 California case People v. Marx was the first time an appellate court allowed bite mark testimony. Three dentists claimed that they could match bite marks on the victim’s nose to the teeth of the defendant. California followed a federal guideline that allowed the defendant to challenge the scientific validity of scientific testimony, but the appeals court ruled that bite mark matching was less science than a matter of common sense.</p>

<p>Three years later, another California appeals court cited Marx in upholding bite mark testimony once again, noting the “superior trustworthiness of the scientific bite mark approach.” But the Marx judges had explicitly noted that the analysis wasn’t scientific. Nonetheless, other courts began citing the case. By 1987, 21 state appellate courts across the United States had accepted bite mark analysis, without a single dissenting opinion. By 2004, courts in 37 U.S. jurisdictions had accepted it.</p>

<p>In the 1990s, DNA testing began to show that bite mark analysis wasn’t as reliable as its practitioners claimed. We now know that such analysis has led to more than two dozen wrongful arrests and convictions. And a growing number of studies have found no scientific evidence to support its two core assumptions — that teeth are as unique as fingerprints and that human skin can record this uniqueness with enough detail to identify someone.</p>

<p>Yet, to date, every time a defendant has challenged the scientific validity of bite mark analysis, the court has upheld it, including a Pennsylvania court last year. Judges point out that lots of other courts across the country have ruled that bite mark evidence is legitimate. In fact, in at least three states, the controlling case law on such evidence is a case in which the defendant was later exonerated. In Wisconsin, the controlling precedent is a 1986 ruling in which the judges went on for paragraphs about the impeccable scientific credentials of the bite mark witnesses. The court declared that the analysts had been so utterly convincing as “to exclude to a moral certainty every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.” That conviction was overturned based on DNA evidence in 2009, after the defendant spent 23 years in prison.</p>

<p>Courts have been more amenable to SBS defendants. The National Registry of Exonerations lists 16 SBS convictions that have been overturned. But so far, there has been no systematic effort to review old convictions. (In August 2014, the Mississippi Supreme Court granted Brandon an evidentiary hearing, which has yet to take place.)</p>

<p>Once they’ve been convicted because of expert testimony of dubious scientific validity, defendants are usually on their own to find an attorney to challenge that evidence after the fact. And they face daunting procedural barriers. Where science questions the wisdom of the past, the legal system tends to rely on it. So once expert testimony is allowed and a verdict is rendered, the courts put a premium on finality — on precedent and consistency. At that point, even good science often can’t fix the error.</p>

<p>To get a new trial, a defendant must show that he has discovered new evidence, demonstrate that the new evidence was not discoverable at the time of trial and file his claim within a year of when the new evidence could have reasonably been discovered. The last requirement is especially onerous. For a prisoner convicted with bite mark testimony, when does the clock start ticking on the window to file his petition?</p>

<p>File your case too soon — say, after the first few studies have been published — and the court may rule that the expertise used to convict you hasn’t yet been discredited. You could now be procedurally barred from raising the issue again. But wait for a stronger scientific consensus before filing, and the court could rule that you’ve missed the one-year deadline.</p>

<p>It gets even trickier when the issue is not a field of forensics but an expert in a legitimate field who gives scientifically objectionable testimony. For 20 years, defendants have tried to challenge Steven Hayne’s credibility and credentials. They’ve lost almost every time, even as media reports and defense attorneys have raised doubts about Hayne’s work habits, professionalism and objectivity. (Hayne has denied accusations that he performed too many autopsies or was a rubber stamp for prosecutors. In 2008, he was barred from doing autopsies for state prosecutors. He now testifies for the defense and in civil cases.)</p>

<p>James Koon was convicted in Louisiana in 1996 for killing an infant whose autopsy Hayne performed. Koon filed for a new trial in 2012, arguing that the revelations about Hayne’s credibility constituted newly discovered evidence. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit unanimously held in 2014 that “the witness for Louisiana, Dr. Steven Hayne, a now-discredited Mississippi coroner, lied about his qualifications as an expert and thus gave unreliable testimony about the cause of death.”</p>

<p>Yet Koon was still denied a new trial, because the court ruled that he had missed the one-year window for his claim. He’d filed within a year of learning about Hayne but not within a year of media exposés, complaints to professional organizations and even a concurring opinion by a state supreme court justice in 2007.</p>

<p>Even as those criticisms were being published, courts continued to affirm Hayne’s status as an expert witness. In fact, the very same federal court of appeals had upheld Hayne’s credibility earlier in 2014. There’s just no way Koon could have won.</p>

<p>Even among discredited medical examiners, Hayne is something of an outlier. By his own admission, he performed 1,200 to 1,800 autopsies a year in Mississippi for almost 20 years. Most professional organizations recommend no more than 300 a year. But if the courts can’t provide a just outcome to people convicted by an outlier expert, there’s even less reason to think they’ll get it right on the closer calls.</p>

<p>Our courts strive for finality because, the thinking goes, if verdicts can be overturned on a whim, the public will lose faith in the integrity of the system. And if the courts were to truly reckon with the mess wrought by bad forensics, we’d see a lot of overturned verdicts, certainly enough to sow doubt about the system.</p>

<p>But refusing to rectify unjust verdicts doesn’t preserve the integrity of our system, only the appearance of it. Meanwhile, innocent people remain behind bars.</p>

<h2 id="newrevelationsintheastonishinglyrecklessandincompetentdeathsentenceprosecutionofalfreddewaynebrown">New revelations in the astonishingly reckless and incompetent death-sentence prosecution of Alfred Dewayne Brown</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-18</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/03/19/new-revelations-in-the-astonishingly-reckless-and-incompetent-death-sentence-prosecution-of-alfred-dewayne-brown/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Alfred Dewayne Brown hugs his lawyer Brian Stolarz in Houston on June 9, 2015, the day after Brown’s release from jail. (Brian Stolarz)</p>

<p>A few years ago, we covered the case of Alfred Dewayne Brown here at The Watch. Brown was wrongly convicted of murder in Harris County, Texas. The flaws in Brown’s conviction were first exposed by the Houston Chronicle. Here are the key details, from one of those previous posts:</p>

<p>The [key] witness in the 2003 case was Ericka Jean Dockery, the then-girlfriend of Alfred Dewayne Brown, who was accused of murdering a Houston police officer during an armed robbery. Dockery was Brown’s alibi. He claimed he was at her house when the murder took place. Brown also claimed to have called [Dockery] at her work from her house that morning. Dockery initially supported Brown’s story. But after aggressive questioning from a Harris County grand jury, including threats to charge her with perjury and take away her children, Dockery changed her story, and became a key witness for the prosecution. Brown was convicted and sentenced to death.</p>

<p>Seven years later, a phone record confirming Brown’s story about calling Dockery from her apartment was found in the garage of one of the Houston detectives investigating the case.</p>

<p>Houston Chronicle columnist Lisa Falkenberg then discovered that the foreman of the grand jury berated Dockery into changing her testimony, to the point of threatening the loss of her children. What’s more, the foreman was a longtime cop with the Houston Police Department. Another member of the grand jury also had ties to law enforcement. And we first reported here at The Watch that this particular officer had served on at least nine other grand juries. We reported not only that cops served on Harris County grand juries pretty regularly, but also that the grand juries themselves tended to have troublingly close relationships with law enforcement. This was because Harris County used an antiquated method of selecting grand juries called the key-man system, which allowed prosecutors to stack the deliberative bodies with people who tend to be more pro-law enforcement and pro-prosecution.</p>

<p>Brown was eventually exonerated and released. And Texas has since passed a law eliminating the key-man system.</p>

<p>But now we get a new revelation about the prosecutor in the case. From the Houston Chronicle:</p>

<p>A prosecutor who obtained a wrongful conviction that sent a Houston man to death row for nearly 10 years didn’t just withhold evidence but also denied under oath that he had information that supported Alfred Dewayne Brown’s alibi, court records show.</p>

<p>In a sworn statement from 2008, former Harris County prosecutor Dan Rizzo said he did not withhold telephone records that could have been aided Brown’s defense. The Houston Chronicle obtained a copy of the statement this week.</p>

<p>The denial stands in sharp contrast to a newly recovered email released Friday by the Harris County District Attorney’s Office that shows a detective told Rizzo about the phone records in 2003 before Brown’s trial. Rizzo never disclosed it to the defense.</p>

<p>And then those records, which again supported Brown’s alibi, weren’t found in the public record for the case. They somehow ended up in the garage of one of the detectives who investigated the case. Somehow.</p>

<p>“It’s absolutely perjury,” said criminal defense attorney Pat McCann, who has no connection to the case. “Mr. Rizzo has an astonishingly flexible relationship with the truth.”</p>

<p>Rizzo could not be reached for comment Thursday, and the Texas District and County Attorneys Association declined to weigh in.</p>

<p>Some former colleagues defended the retired assistant district attorney, labeling him a “good man” who simply “missed some details.”</p>

<p>“I will never believe that Dan Rizzo would ever intentionally violate the Brady rule, that he would intentionally hide evidence,” said retired longtime prosecutor Ted Wilson. “Was this a screw-up? No question about it. But I do not believe that Dan Rizzo intentionally did that.”</p>

<p>Just to illustrate the preposterousness of calling this a mere “screw-up” by a prosecutor who “missed some details,” let’s recap what actually happened:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Alfred Dewayne Brown is accused of killing a police officer.</p></li>

<li><p>The grand jury investigating the case is stacked with pro-police jurors, including a cop (who serves as foreman) and a guy who had recently served as president of a group that raises money for the families of fallen police officers and firefighters. Again, this is the grand jury that is investigating the killing of a police officer. </p></li>

<li><p>Brown has an alibi. He was staying at Dockery’s apartment at the time of the crime and placed a call to her office from there.</p></li>

<li><p>The detectives investigating the case at some point obtain the phone records proving Brown’s alibi.</p></li>

<li><p>One detective emails prosecutor Dan Rizzo to inform him of the exculpatory phone records.</p></li>

<li><p>Rizzo not only never turns the phone records over to Brown’s attorneys, he also later issues a sworn statement that he never possessed any records that would have supported Brown’s alibi.</p></li>

<li><p>Meanwhile, Dockery tells the grand jury the truth — that Brown called her at work from her apartment. For this, the grand jury foreman — again, a cop serving on a jury investigating the killing of another cop — berates her, threatens to charge with perjury and threatens to take away her children.</p></li>

<li><p>For good measure, Rizzo files felony aggravated perjury charges against Dockery. She spends about seven weeks in jail. She is the mother of three young children. She’s given a clear choice: Tell prosecutors what they wanted to hear, and she’ll go free. Stick with Brown’s alibi, and she’ll remain behind bars.</p></li>

<li><p>Dockery finally changes her story. She not only says Brown told to her to lie to back up his alibi, but that Brown’s brother threatened her children. Rizzo still refuses to drop the perjury charges, which gives him continued leverage over the woman. At trial, she goes even further and claims Brown confessed to her. Brown is convicted and sentenced to death.</p></li>

<li><p>Seven years later, investigators for Brown’s defense find phone records confirming Brown’s alibi. They’re found in the garage of a police detective. Dockery retracts her incriminating statements and testimony. Brown is exonerated and released in 2015.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Given all of this, it’s hard to see how Rizzo merely didn’t see or merely overlooked the phone records, and somehow had “forgotten” about the email notifying him of their existence. Rizzo went to great pains to defeat Brown’s alibi, including threatening and jailing a woman on false perjury charges until she changed her story (at which point, it’s worth noting, she actually committed perjury). Phone records are pretty easy for law enforcement officials to obtain. Rizzo’s suspect had an alibi. Phone records would confirm or disprove that alibi. It should have been the first thing he looked for. If the phone records weren’t in the police files on the case, he should have asked why not, or he should have obtained them himself.</p>

<p>At the very least, this is egregious prosecutorial incompetence. Even looking at all of this in a light most favorable to Rizzo, the former prosecutor jailed a woman and threatened to take away her children until she gave him false testimony; failed to notice and turn over evidence that was not only exculpatory but exonerating; and never bothered to look for or obtain the records that would easily have validated or contradicted his suspect’s alibi. And in the end, all of that resulted in the state of Texas sending an innocent man to death row.</p>

<p>Brown is still trying to get compensated for his time on death row. Rizzo is retired and still collecting his pension.</p>

<h2 id="whyarepolicedepartmentsstillusingdrugfieldtests">Why are police departments still using drug field tests?</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-12</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/03/13/why-are-police-departments-still-using-drug-field-tests/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>The Miami Herald reports that a Tampa Bay mother of four spent five months in jail after a drug field test erroneously tested positive for oxycodone. It took that long for her husband to accumulate the money to post bail. It then took another seven months before the state crime lab showed the field test to be in error.</p>

<p>Here at The Watch, we’ve been keeping a running list of the items that have resulted in false positives on these field tests. That list includes sage, chocolate chip cookies, motor oil, spearmint, Dr. Bronner’s Magic Soap, tortilla dough, deodorant, billiards chalk, patchouli, flour, eucalyptus, breath mints, Jolly Ranchers, Krispy Kreme donut glaze, exposure to air and loose-leaf tea. The latter item triggered a SWAT raid on an innocent couple and their two children.</p>

<p>In 2016, a report by Pro Publica and the New York Times found widespread false positives and user errors by cops when administering the most popular tests. Precise error rates are hard to calculate, because some test results can be affected by variables such as weather conditions, user error and lighting conditions. Some studies have shown error rates ranging from 1 in 5 false positives to 1 in 3. But even those disturbing figures can get worse if you create an incentive for a police officer to want a positive result. In 2009, the Marijuana Policy Project used the KN Reagent field test on 42 substances that weren’t marijuana. They were able to get false positives on 70 percent of them.</p>

<p>The ProPublica report also found that the most commonly used tests didn’t include warnings about the high false-positive rate, despite a 2000 guideline from the Justice Department to do so. Surprisingly, the report found that more than half of those wrongly charged after a false positive actually pleaded guilty, an indication of how the threat of serious jail time can persuade innocent people to falsely confess.</p>

<p>Yet even after the 2016 ProPublica-New York Times report was published and received nationwide attention, police departments across the country continued to use the flawed field kids. In Las Vegas, the police department continued to use the kits despite repeated warnings from the crime lab that they were unreliable. In fact, in 2014 the crime lab sent a report to the DOJ warning that the tests were resulting in false convictions, and that better technology was available and should be adopted. The police department responded by expanding the use of the flawed field tests.</p>

<p>Police agencies that still use the tests claim that they’re primarily used as a preliminary test, after which the substance in question is sent to a crime lab for more definitive tests. In other words, field-test results aren’t submitted as evidence in trials. But that isn’t always true. A Pro Publica review of 2015 drug cases in Las Vegas found that thousands of people were convicted due to field-test results.</p>

<p>But even in jurisdictions where only lab tests — not field tests — are allowed in court, people will still get arrested, jailed for months and possibly tricked into accepting plea bargains because of false positives. The people most likely to be caught up in all of this are of course the poor, who can’t afford bail, are sidled with an overworked public defender who may pressure them into accepting a plea bargain, and who may be more inclined to plead guilty to possession charge in exchange for, say, probation, than to remain in jail (again, because they can’t afford bail) while waiting to fight a more serious charge.</p>

<p>So why do police agencies keep using the tests? One reason is undoubtedly that drug arrests are usually seen as a sign of productivity. Federal anti-drug grants are often tied to raw arrest figures, as are the performance evaluations of individual officers.</p>

<p>But asset forfeiture is probably the bigger incentive. If a field test turns up positive on a substance found in your car, the officer who pulled you over can seize your cash, any other property in the vehicle and even the car itself. We’ve seen numerous stories about police agencies who give motorists the option of signing over their cash and going on their way, or insisting on fighting for their property, at which point they’ll be arrested, jailed and perhaps eventually tried who knows how many months into the future. Most sign over their property. It’s easy to see why even an innocent person would do so. In most cases, the hassle wouldn’t worth the cost of whatever cash a motorist may be carrying. In these cases, the positive test result is never scrutinized.</p>

<p>Imagine having a tool that magically persuaded people to voluntarily hand over whatever cash they were carrying. Who wouldn’t be tempted to use it early and often?</p>

<p>I’m glad to see that the woman in Florida is suing. That’s the only thing that might change all of this. It really ought to be a national scandal. Police agencies are making arrests, jailing people, coercing innocent people to plead guilty and seizing property by relying on tests that, by now, they have reason to know are wholly unreliable. (Note, too, how these tests haven’t been shown to return false negatives. The manufacturers of these kits know what the police agencies want.) The only way it will stop is if there are real consequences for the cities, counties and states whose police agencies continue to use them.</p>

<h2 id="thecaseofthebloodyboltcutters">The case of the bloody bolt cutters</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-03-08</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/03/09/the-case-of-the-bloody-bolt-cutters/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>As I explained in a post last week, I have a new book out, which I co-wrote with Tucker Carrington. The book is about Steven Hayne and Michael West, two forensic experts who dominated the autopsy system in Mississippi for nearly 20 years. In researching the book, my co-author and I found far too many examples of forensic malfeasance by these two than we could fit into a 400-page book. So I’ll be posting a few cases from the “director’s cut” manuscript here at The Watch.</p>

<p>Today’s case begins in June of 1991, after Ken Strickland and David Duplantis escaped from a cell in the Lauderdale County, Miss., jail. The two men embarked on a murderous, multiday crime spree that ultimately earned them both death sentences. There’s little doubt that the two men were guilty of the crimes they were accused of committing after their escape. There was ample evidence against them. But the prosecutors apparently wanted more, so they brought in Hayne and West to perform some of their voodoo forensics. Hayne and West had in fact been advertising their ability to match wound patterns using infrared light.</p>

<p>After clearing the prison walls, Strickland and Duplantis swiped some bubble gum and a pair of bolt cutters from a nearby stockyard. Strickland’s former landlord had read about the escape and feared that Strickland might stop by his old residence. The house she once rented to Strickland was now occupied by a recently divorced woman. The landlord called her tenant’s ex-husband, a man named Gary Thrash, to see if he’d drop by the house and check up on his ex-wife.</p>

<p>Content from Prime Video</p>

<p>“When you have diverse views, it makes the outcome for all people better.” – Justice Anne McKeig </p>

<p>As the landlord had feared, Strickland and Duplantis did stop by the house. The woman wasn’t there, but Thrash was.When the two escapees saw him, they beat him to death with the bolt cutters.</p>

<p>The evidence against the two men was overwhelming. Their fingerprints were all over the house where Thrash’s body was found. Two phone calls were made from the house’s phone — one to Duplantis’s stepfather and one to the Lauderdale County jail. The bolt cutters covered with Thrash’s blood and hair were found in Thrash’s own truck. The stockyard confirmed that they were the same bolt cutters Strickland and Duplantis had stolen.</p>

<p>Still, despite all of that, prosecutors turned to Hayne and West. According to testimony West would later give at trial, he and Hayne suspected the bolt cutters had left some sort of impression on the hands of whoever had used them to kill Thrash. To test their hypothesis, they recruited a volunteer who worked at the morgue. West would later say that the morgue assistant walked outside with bolt cutters in hand, “rear[ed] back like a baseball bat,” swung, and hit either a “pine tree or a telephone pole” — West could’t remember which.</p>

<p>The two forensic analysts then examined the volunteer’s hands, where they claimed to see some indentations made by the bolt cutters. They recorded the indentations, then shined an infrared light on the hands of Duplantis and Strickland to look for the same imprint. (West claimed to have invented this technique. He called it the West Phenomenon.) Sure enough, West said he found the same pattern on Strickland’s hand that he found on the hand of his volunteer.</p>

<p>Common sense says this is garbage forensics. Even accepting the dubious proposition that a pair of bolt cutters could leave a unique, identifiable pattern on human hands, in order for the patterns to match, the morgue assistant would had to have swung the bolt cutters at the same precise angle as Strickland in order affect the same points of contact between the bolt cutters and his hand. The assistant would also have needed to strike the tree from the same distance Strickland stood from Thrash, and make contact at the same height from which Strickland struck Thrash’s head. The assistant would also probably have needed to swing the bolt cutters at about the same velocity as the killer. And to leave the same impression, we also would have to assume that when hit with a pair of bolt cutters, a tree (or possibly a telephone poll) would provide the same amount of resistance to those bolt cutters — resistance that would then transfer to the hands that are swinging them — as a human head.</p>

<p>Strickland’s hands were also examined more than a day after the crime, so they would have had some time to heal and his skin more time to spring back from any indentations than the assistant’s hands and skin. Nevertheless, Hayne and West were permitted to put all of this in front of a jury.</p>

<p>At his trial, Duplantis asked the court for funds to hire his own expert to counter Hayne. The trial judge refused, finding an independent expert unnecessary. In 1994, Duplantis asked for a new trial based on that decision (and other claims). The Mississippi Supreme Court shot him down.</p>

<p>Duplantis tried again a few years later, arguing that Hayne was not a credible witness and should not have been permitted to testify about the bolt cutters in particular. In 1998, the Mississippi Supreme Court rejected those claim, too, ruling that “Dr. Hayne is unquestionably qualified to testify in our courts as a forensic pathologist. He has done so many times in the past. As such, he is well equipped to give an expert opinion that the wounds suffered by Gary Thrash were inflicted by an object similar to the bolt cutters recovered from Mr. Thrash’s truck.”</p>

<p>But whether Hayne had testified in the past says little about whether his testimony in this particular case was scientific and reliable. Alas, this tends to be how courts evaluate expert testimony. The bulk of their analysis of the scientific merit of such testimony tends to be to see whether other courts have already allowed it. In this case, it was merely whether other courts had allowed any testimony from this particular expert.</p>

<p>Obviously, Strickland and Duplantis aren’t the most sympathetic figures. When it comes to injustice, this case isn’t on par with cases in which there’s real doubt about the defendant’s guilt. But if it does demonstrate just how much the courts let Hayne and West get away with. West in particular would go on to testify in other cases about finding impressions on a suspect’s hands that he claimed were a match to or were consistent with gripping a knife, a gun, a screwdriver, and the strap of a purse, respectively. In most cases, West claimed to have found these impressions days or even more than a week after the alleged crime. And he found most after using the West Phenomenon — again, a technique he invented.</p>

<p>I have a new book out this week. It is at heart an investigation of how Mississippi medical examiner Steven Hayne and the forensic dentist Michael West dominated the death investigation system in that state (and to a lesser extent, Louisiana) for the better part of 20 years. The book also looks more generally at the history of forensics and the coroner system in America, and critiques how forensic analysis is used in court today.</p>

<p>In writing the book, my co-author Tucker Carrington and I found far more examples of malfeasance on the part of Hayne and West than we could fit into our manuscript. We ended up cutting quite a few cases that I think still deserve to be heard. So I’ll be posting some of the “director’s cut” material here over the next several weeks.</p>

<p>The first story is the case of Tina Funderburk, a mentally ill woman who was incarcerated for years without a trial because of a flawed autopsy report and a criminal-justice system ill-equipped to handle her disability.</p>

<p>In 2003, the skeletonized body of Funderburk’s daughter — 3-year-old Reina Russell — turned up in a swampy area behind the Greyhound bus station in Jackson, Miss. Funderburk, who lived in New York, was a paranoid schizophrenic. New York law enforcement authorities initially claimed that Funderburk admitted to killing her daughter by suffocating her. But later, they could produce no documentation of any confession. When she was extradited to Mississippi, Funderburk told police that after leaving the bus in Jackson with her daughter and young son, she saw a helicopter and heard police sirens. Thinking someone was chasing her, she fled into a nearby woods with her son and daughter. When she and the boy emerged later, she realized she had left her daughter behind.</p>

<p>Still believing she was being followed, Funderburk didn’t return to the woods to find her daughter. Instead, she and her son returned to Brooklyn. When they arrived, the father of the girl realized his daughter was missing and notified police. In September 2003, a forensic anthropologist determined that “due to the completeness of the decomposition” of Reina’s remains, she couldn’t determine either the cause or the manner of the girl’s death. Two months later, Mississippi medical examiner Steven Hayne claimed he could determine both. Hayne concluded that the Reina’s death was a homicide and the manner was “consistent with compression of the head and consistent with suffocation.” Funderburk was arrested and charged with murder.</p>

<p>In 2008, New York medical examiner Michael Baden reviewed Hayne’s autopsy for the Innocence Project in New York. Baden found no evidence to indicate a homicide or suffocation and speculated that Hayne’s conclusion was based more on police reports than on physical evidence. In a 2012 deposition, Hayne would later admit that his diagnosis of strangulation was based on the reports from New York police that Funderburk had confessed, not on anything found in his autopsy. While forensic pathologists sometimes consult with police before doing an autopsy, the practice is generally frowned upon. The National Association of Medical Examiners recommends that forensic pathologists “investigate cooperatively with, but independent from, law enforcement and prosecutors. The parallel investigation promotes neutral and objective medical assessment of the cause and manner of death.”</p>

<p>Moreover, when a medical examiner gives a cause and manner of death, the implication is that these were both based on the doctor’s expertise in what he or she found during the autopsy. To simply reiterate what is in the police report takes advantage of the trust we put in a medical examiner’s expertise and authority. The only reason Hayne was later forced to admit his lack of thoroughness in this case is that the police reports he relied upon turned out to be incorrect.</p>

<p>A state psychiatrist eventually diagnosed Funderburk with paranoid schizophrenia. She was treated for three months at a mental hospital but then returned to the Hinds County jail in Miss. Because she had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, Funderburke couldn’t be tried for the murder of her daughter. Because the mental hospital said her illness was under control, she couldn’t stay at the facility. But because of Hayne’s autopsy concluding that Funderburk’s daughter had been murdered, Funderburk couldn’t be freed. So she had to stay in prison. In January 2012, the Clarion-Ledger reported that Funderburk was still sitting in the Hinds County jail. Only after that article was published did Mississippi officials finally move for her release. By that time she had served more than eight years in jail without ever getting a trial.</p>

<p>My new book hits the shelves today. I wrote “The Cadaver King and the Country Dentist” with Tucker Carrington, director of the George C. Cochran Innocence Project at the University of Mississippi School of Law. So as not to inundate you with book-related stuff, I think I’ll just compile reviews and book tour dates and post them here once a week.</p>

<p>First, here are some kind things some folks have written about the book thus far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kirkus reviews: “A horrifying exposé of how a few individuals can infect an entire state’s criminal justice system”</p></li>

<li><p>Publishers Weekly: “A clear and shocking portrait of the structural failings of the U.S. criminal justice system. … This eminently readable book builds a hard-to-ignore case for comprehensive reform.”</p></li>

<li><p>Booklist: “A searing investigation. … This work should spark both admiration and outrage — and, one hopes, reform.”</p></li>

<li><p>Library Journal: “A chilling, fact-filled narrative. … Well-documented and accessible, with a definite point of view, this book … is notable for its depth and geographic focus. This stinging exposé of faulty forensics is suited to the serious CSI enthusiast as well as students of criminal justice.”</p></li>

<li><p>BookPage: “Compellingly written, The Cadaver King and the Country Dentist is a chilling reminder of what happens to the rule of law when the law forgets the rules.”</p></li>

<li><p>Garden &amp; Gun: “A blistering exposé of Mississippi’s bungle-prone process of investigating deaths.”</p></li>

<li><p>Simple Justice: ” An infuriating and important book. It deserves to be read. It needs to be read. Read it.”</p></li>

<li><p>Local Voice (North Mississippi): “A brilliantly reported and enraging chronicle of decades-long abuses.”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The book was also named one of Amazon’s best nonfiction books for February, and we were fortunate enough to get some flattering jacket blurbs from Slate’s Dahlia Lithwick, National Book Award winner Ibram Kendi, and James Forman Jr., author of the acclaimed “Locking Up Our Own.” And here’s a Q&amp;A my co-author and I recently did with Vice.</p>

<p>I also did a Q&amp;A with the Nashville Scene, and you can read excerpts both there and in the new issue of Reason.</p>

<h2 id="puttingmorecopsinschoolswontmakeschoolssaferanditwilllikelyinflictalotofharm">Putting more cops in schools won't make schools safer, and it will likely inflict a lot of harm</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-21</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/02/22/putting-more-cops-in-schools-wont-make-schools-safer-and-it-will-likely-inflict-a-lot-of-harm/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>One of the more popular reactions from the right to the Parkland, Fla, school shooting — and from Fox News personalities in particular — is that we need to put more cops in schools. Or to put in armed guards, or retired soldiers, who would in all likelihood be given the same powers as police.</p>

<p>Would it work? Probably not. But we first need to acknowledge something before delving into this discussion: a classroom is just about the safest place a kid can be in America. I realize that’s a difficult thing to accept after an event as traumatic as Parkland. According to a New York Times review of statistics from the Gun Violence Archive, 43 people were killed on school campuses in 2017, 25 were killed in 2016, and 33 in 2015. That includes both victims of mass shootings and conventional homicides (my somewhat-awkward term for homicides other than those from mass shootings). That’s out of about 55 million students attending K-12 schools, public and private. The odds of a given child getting killed in a mass school shooting — or any school shooting — are literally less than 1 in 1 million. The criminologist James Alan Fox points out that since 1990, there have been 22 shootings at schools in which two or more people were shot, or well less than one incident per year. That’s less than one incident per year out of 100,000 public schools and 33,000 private schools. This means that the average elementary, middle, or high school can expect to see a mass shooting about once every 150,000 years.</p>

<p>These shootings are of course incredibly traumatic. That trauma is amplified by the round-the-clock coverage they receive. And, of course, I’m sure that if you know someone who has been killed in a school shooting, these statistics probably mean very little to you. But good public policy should be driven by sound data, not collective trauma. Putting retired soldiers or TSA-like checkpoints in our schools to prevent mass shootings is a clumsy and incredibly heavy-handed solution in search of a problem.</p>

<p>But let’s get back to the important question: Does it work? To answer that question, we need to look at the costs and benefits.</p>

<p>On the benefits side, the answer is pretty unsatisfying — it’s just hard to say if there are any. Part of the reason for this is that, again, violent crime in school is already incredibly low — so low, that looking at actual violent crime statistics is basically useless. School shootings are so rare, there’s just no way to gather a sample size large enough to draw any conclusions. Anecdotally, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School did have a sheriff’s deputy on duty at time of the shooting, but he never discharged his weapon. Would it have been different if there had been four or five or six armed guards? Possibly. But again, we simply don’t have enough of these incidents (thankfully) to say for sure. There’s also a question of public resources, here. Does it make sense to pay a half dozen armed guards to patrol your local school if that school isn’t likely to see a mass shooting for tens of thousands of years?</p>

<p>If we look at nonviolent crime, we do start to see enough incidents to possibly make some comparisons, but because of the nature of the questions we’re asking here, this data can also be pretty confounding. Studies have shown that schools with school resource officers (the common euphemism for cops who are assigned to schools) tend to have more nonviolent crime, but that may simply be because schools that see a lot of crime are the schools local officials believe need SROs. It also seems likely that those schools may not actually have more nonviolent crime, it’s that with SROs around, more of it gets reported.</p>

<p>Because of these problems with the data itself, some researchers instead survey how safe students feel in schools with and without SROs. But this method also comes with problems. Whether or not students feel safe could be the product of any number of things that bear little relation to how safe they actually are. I would imagine, for example, that students across the country feel less safe at school today than they did last week, even though their actual relative safety probably hasn’t changed. This of course is entirely understandable. But we want to make policy that creates actual security, not security theater. Surveys have also shown that black students tend to feel less safe in schools with SROs, while white students tend to feel more safe. This could simply be because black students are more distrustful of law enforcement. It could also be because black students are more likely to live in schools in areas with higher crime rates. It tells us little about the efficacy of SROs.</p>

<p>So the benefits are unclear, and possibly unknowable. But at most they are probably minimal, given how little violent crime takes place at school in the first place. What about the costs?</p>

<p>It seems safe to say that putting officers in schools definitely comes with some costs. Here is the executive summary of an ACLU report published last April:</p>

<p>Every day in our nation’s schools, children as young as five are charged with “crimes” for everyday misbehavior: throwing a paper airplane, kicking a trashcan, and wearing sagging pants. In the 2013-14 school year, the most recent year for which statistics are available, schools reported over 223,000 referrals to law enforcement.</p>

<p>A 13-year-old Texas boy who attempted to pay for school lunch with a $2 bill that turned out to be fake faced prison time on charges of felony forgery. In Virginia, a middle school student was charged with assault and battery with a weapon for throwing a baby carrot at her teacher. The criminalization of typical youth behavior has engendered a bizarre reality — students are arrested in schools, places meant to provide safe haven, for behavior that is noncriminal in any other venue . . .</p>

<p>Days after the Columbine High School shooting in 1999, President Clinton cited the first round of COPS grants as a response that would allow schools and police to form partnerships focused on “school crime, drug use, and discipline problems.” In 1998 and 1999, “COPS awarded 275 jurisdictions more than $30 million for law enforcement to partner with school entities to address crime and disorder in and around schools.” </p>

<p>In a nod to the educational mission of schools, lawmakers also asserted that school police would use tactics other than arrests and use of force. Senator Campbell stated that police in schools “would develop or expand community justice initiatives” and “train students in conflict resolution,” a role Senator Lincoln Chafee, a co-sponsor, described as the “most important[]” objective of school resource officers. Members of the House similarly emphasized restorative justice goals and the prevention of police and court involvement. However, as with earlier iterations, the promise of positive support services eased the way for the expansion of policing powers, but the services never materialized. Instead, police, who were neither trained nor certified in counseling or social work, carried on with traditional policing models, addressing perceived rowdiness and disorder through arrests and surveillance of schoolchildren. </p>

<p>The report notes that in 1975, just 1 percent of U.S. schools had a law enforcement presence. Thanks to federal grants driven largely by reaction to school shootings, by 2004 that figure was 36 percent. Today, it’s 24 percent of middle schools and 42 percent of high schools. The report then details how when schools are staffed with cops, administrators grow increasingly likely to defer to SROs, who take a law enforcement approach instead of disciplining kids with punishments such as detention or in-school suspension.</p>

<p>For example, the San Bernardino City Unified School District, in California, makes more juvenile arrests than do municipal police in some of California’s largest cities, and 91 percent of these arrests are for misdemeanors like disorderly conduct. In the Jefferson Parish Public School System, the largest in Louisiana, the Southern Poverty Law Center found that the most common cause of student arrests was “interference with an educational facility.” These findings are consistent with American Bar Association assessments of the juvenile justice systems in many states; the assessments found that school-based referrals and arrests had increased dramatically by the mid-2000s, with schools using the juvenile justice system as a “‘dumping ground’ for youth with special needs.” In one North Carolina county, a full “two-thirds of delinquency case complaints came from the public school system,” and across the state, “[c]hildren as young as six and seven are referred to court for issues that seem clearly to relate to special education status.” Similarly, reviewers in Maryland found that “in interviews, many law enforcement officials across several counties reported a spike in juvenile arrests during the school year due to the presence of school resource officers.” </p>

<p>A 2015 study published in the Washington University Law Review came to similar conclusions. From the executive summary:</p>

<p>Drawing on recent restricted data from the US Department of Education, this Article presents an original empirical analysis revealing that a police officer’s regular presence at a school is predictive of greater odds that school officials refer students to law enforcement for committing various offenses, including these lower-level offenses. This trend holds true even after controlling for: (1) state statutes that require schools to report certain incidents to law enforcement; (2) general levels of criminal activity and disorder that occur at schools; (3) neighborhood crime; and (4) other demographic variables. The consequences of involving students in the criminal justice system are severe, especially for students of color, and may negatively affect the trajectory of students’ lives. Therefore, lawmakers and school officials should consider alternative methods to create safer learning environments.</p>

<p>And here’s a summary of the findings of a 2011 study published in Justice Quarterly:</p>

<p>The use of police in schools has increased dramatically in the past 12 years, largely due to increases in US Department of Justice funding. This study used data from the School Survey on Crime and Safety to assess the extent to which the addition of police in schools is associated with changes in levels of school crime and schools responses to crime. We found that as schools increase their use of police, they record more crimes involving weapon and drugs and report a higher percentage of their non-serious violent crimes to law enforcement. The possibility that placement of police officers in schools increases referrals to law enforcement for crimes of a less serious nature and increases recording of weapon and drug offenses requires that more rigorous research be carried out to assess more carefully the school climate and school safety outcomes related to this popular and costly practice.</p>

<p>And this, from a 2009 study published in the Journal of Criminal Justice:</p>

<p>The high number of disorderly conduct incidences at SRO schools compared to non-SRO schools was consistent with the belief that SROs contribute to criminalizing student behavior. Having an SRO at school significantly increased the rate of arrests for this charge by over 100 percent even when controlling for school poverty. Given that disorderly conduct was the most common charge in this study, these results have serious implications for schools, law enforcement agencies, and juvenile courts. Clearly, disorderly conduct is the most subjective, situational, and circumstantial of the charges studied here. Compared to more objective situations like finding a youth in possession of a knife or narcotics, the decision to interpret disruptive behavior as criminal is done at the officer’s discretion.</p>

<p>And then there are the use of force issues. Cops are authorized to use force in a way that teachers and school administrators are not. This is because cops are trained to use force. Administrators are trained to counsel, de-escalate and discipline in other ways. If administrators increasingly turn to on-site police officers to discipline students, that means more kids will be handcuffed, Tased and beaten. There have been a number of incidents over the years that made national headlines, particularly once video cameras in cellphones became common. Though SROs exist in every state, only 12 states require specialized training for officers who are assigned to schools.</p>

<p>It’s difficult to say whether these incidents are merely anecdotal or if SROs really do use force more often than they should. For one, I haven’t been able to find any data on how often SROs use force nationwide, but even if such data existed, it would be difficult to evaluate — to what would we compare those figures?</p>

<p>However, there are studies showing that SROs use force disproportionately on different populations of students. From a 2015 piece in the Atlantic:</p>

<p>Black students were 16 percent of the total student enrollment in the 2011-12 school year but 27 percent of students referred to law enforcement and 31 percent of students involved in a school-related arrest, according to the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights data.</p>

<p>Students with disabilities represented about 12 percent of the total student population but accounted for a quarter of those arrested and referred to law enforcement, 75 percent of those who were physically restrained at school and 58 percent of those placed in seclusion or involuntary confinement.</p>

<p>Those numbers are worrying.</p>

<p>I’ll end this post with a quick description of the image at the top. It’s from a t-shirt sold by an SRO union in Northern California. The head of the police union later apologized, but the mentality that would cause such a shirt to be printed and sold in the first place is revealing. Kids require patience, subtlety and empathy. Police officers on average get 120 hours of training in using force for every 8 hours in conflict resolution. If we know that SROs don’t get much additional training than that, and if we know that the presence of SROs means school officials are increasingly likely to defer to on-site officers for discipline, that’s a huge problem. The criminal-justice system has all the subtlety and nuance of a hammer. If you put that system in charge of school kids’ day-to-day safety, you shouldn’t be surprised if it starts to treat the kids like nails.</p>

<h2 id="mississippicontinuestounderfunditsdeathinvestigationsystem">Mississippi continues to underfund its death investigation system</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-19</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/02/20/mississippi-continues-to-underfund-its-death-investigation-system/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>One of the central themes of our new book (which comes out next week) is the utter inadequacy of America’s death investigation systems — and that of Mississippi, in particular. The state has long relied on the antiquated, easily corrupted coroner system. Even after creating a state medical examiner position in the late 1970s, state lawmakers consistently either underfunded it or refused to fund it at all.</p>

<p>As we’ve discussed here before, a “coroner” is an elected position that oversees the investigation of suspicious deaths. The vast majority of coroners are not doctors. A medical examiner, on the other hand, is a doctor, usually (and ideally) a doctor who is certified in forensic pathology. These are the people who perform autopsies. Ideally, the state medical examiner oversees state death investigations. Some states have moved toward that type of system. Some still rely on coroners. And some have some mix of the two. In Mississippi, the state medical examiner was supposed to oversee the coroners. But the coroners were historically a pretty potent and powerful political force. They forced more than a few state medical examiners to resign in frustration. Eventually, the legislature just stopped funding the position. The coroners, in conjunction with prosecutors and police officials, began contracting autopsies out to private doctors. The bad incentives in that sort of ad hoc system should have been pretty obvious — police and prosecutors are going to migrate toward doctors who tell them what they want to hear, not doctors who give them honest assessments.</p>

<p>Consequently, one man came to monopolize the state’s autopsy referrals, doing 1,500 to 2,000 per year by his own admission. Needless to say, this wasn’t ideal for getting objective, science-based assessments about cause of death. If you’ve read this site with any regularly, you know that story. (If not — or even if so — buy the book!)</p>

<p>Content from Cleveland Clinic</p>

<p>"We don't have barriers between the science part of Cleveland Clinic and the clinical part. Knowledge and experience flow both ways." </p>

<p>In the late 2000s, after a couple exonerations, media exposés and a lot of bad publicity, the state hired its first state medical examiner in 15 years. The legislature also created three forensic pathology labs in different parts of the state to handle autopsies. That system seemed to be doing pretty well for several years. But it now looks as if the state legislature has regressed. From WCBI in Starkville, Miss.:</p>

<p>For years, north Mississippi’s coroners have had only one place to send a body for an autopsy, the state crime lab in Pearl.</p>

<p>Now, due to understaffing and an overcrowded lab, those coroners are being asked to hold bodies.</p>

<p>It’s been the universal anthem for state departments, “we need more funding,” and the crime lab in Pearl is another example.</p>

<p>Without the funding to hire a qualified staff of medical examiners, the now one doctor autopsy lab could affect the efficiency of our local law enforcement and court systems . . .</p>

<p>“There is a critical staff shortage at our forensics lab in Pearl,” said Winston County Coroner, Scott Gregory.</p>

<p>“It’s just equipment sitting everywhere and no one’s working,” said Monroe County Coroner, Alan Gurley.</p>

<p>The understaffed lab performs around 10-20 autopsies a day, but it’s not enough to handle the influx of bodies from all over the state.</p>

<p>“Right now, they have a block on putting bodies down there because they can only hold 19 in their storage area,” said Gregory.</p>

<p>“We are being asked by the state medical examiner to only send cases down that are absolutely necessary to be autopsied,” said Gurley.</p>

<p>“The salary for the state medical examiner, set by our legislature… we’re not even competing with other states, so we’re losing our doctors to other states,” said Gregory.</p>

<p>“We’ve had medical examiners who have left Mississippi, I think, and have went and bad-mouthed what’s going on here. They’re going like ‘You don’t want to go there and work,’” added Gurley.</p>

<p>This debate happens every five or six years in Mississippi (although it happens elsewhere, too). For some reason, the state legislature just doesn’t think funding the medical examiner’s office is much of a priority. It’s such a bizarre thing to neglect. Medical examiners testify in homicide cases. Without them, it would be awfully difficult to convict people. They’re also critical for collecting public-health data, such as statistics on outbreaks of disease, drug overdoses, deaths due to industrial pollution, suicides and poisoning. Backups in these labs mean families of the deceased have to endure delays before having funerals, burials and obtaining closure.</p>

<p>And, of course, when you don’t budget enough money to attract competent doctors to perform autopsies, the need for autopsies doesn’t go away. It’s just met by doctors who are less competent. Now you have less-than-competent doctors testifying at murder trials or investigating police shootings and deaths in custody. The disastrous consequences ripple through the criminal justice system, the medical community, and public health.</p>

<p>The problem is that these consequences aren’t as obvious as, say, underfunding police or fire departments. The only people directly affected by a backlog at the morgue are the families of the deceased and the people who work at the morgue. Misclassified deaths or a dearth of public-health statistics can be enormously consequential in the long run, but in the short term, they aren’t the sorts of issues people complain about to their legislators or in a letter to the editor. It isn’t until we see headlines about the wrongly convicted — and the real killer who went on to kill again — that we see the benefits of having a competent, fully funded system of investigating death.</p>

<h2 id="atennesseelawintendedtohelpvulnerablepeoplenowkeepstheminsolitaryconfinement">A Tennessee law intended to help vulnerable people now keeps them in solitary confinement</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-02-15</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/02/16/a-tennessee-law-intended-to-help-vulnerable-people-now-keeps-them-in-solitary-confinement/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>The Nation reported that nearly half a million people are sitting in U.S. jails while awaiting trial. (Bigstock)</p>

<p>It’s amazing the sorts of everyday abuses you can find in the nooks and crannies of our criminal justice system.</p>

<p>The state of Tennessee locked Regenia Bowman in solitary confinement for more than six months because she had a skin infection.</p>

<p>Bowman wasn’t violent, and she hadn’t threatened anyone. She was free on bond when she walked into a courtroom in Bledsoe County in April 2014 to answer charges of selling prescription painkillers, a violation of her probation on a similar charge. During the hearing, when it looked like Bowman was headed to jail, her lawyer revealed she was sick with what turned out to be MRSA, an antibiotic-resistant staph infection.</p>

<p>The judge suggested sending her to a “special needs” facility in Nashville. Bowman, now 54, assumed she would be going to a clinic or hospital.</p>

<p>Instead, she was driven more than 120 miles to the Tennessee Prison for Women, which usually houses people already convicted of a crime. There, without understanding why, she was dressed in white, the uniform of maximum security prisoners. She was placed in solitary — locked down 23 hours a day with three showers a week and fed through a slot in her cell door. The MRSA cleared up in about two months, she said, but records show she was held in these conditions for 189 days.</p>

<p>An investigation by the Tennessean newspaper and the Marshall Project found that, over a six-year period, more than 300 people in Tennessee found themselves in a situation similar to Bowman’s — being declared safekeepers.</p>

<p>The law is intended to relieve a financial burden on local jails and get pretrial detainees necessary care or protect jail staff. Some safekeepers have allegedly attacked guards or fashioned crude weapons. But interviews and court records show people are sent to safekeeping because they are juveniles, pregnant, wrestling with severe mental illness or simply too notorious to remain in county lockup. They have not been convicted of a crime, but all of them are shipped far away from their families and defense lawyers and placed in cells usually reserved for the state’s most unruly, dangerous inmates.</p>

<p>One of at least eight states with a safekeeping law, Tennessee has no formal review process to determine if and when inmates should be returned to their original counties.</p>

<p>A survey of people in “safekeeping” on Dec. 31 last year found that the average person had been incarcerated without trial for 328 days. In most of these cases, these people are getting extra punishment — and pretty severe punishment at that — simply because the local town or county can’t accommodate their “special” needs. (I put special in quotes only because there’s nothing particularly unique about being pregnant, or a juvenile, mentally ill. These are all conditions that jails ought to be adequately prepared to handle.)</p>

<p>This seems like a good time to revisit another disturbing statistic: About a half million people are sitting in America’s jails while still awaiting trial. That means they’ve yet to be convicted of a crime. They represent about 60 to 70 percent of the total jail population. That includes about 60 percent of women currently locked up in U.S. jails. According to one survey, 70 percent of people in jail had a job at the time they were arrested. A New Orleans man was recently released after waiting in jail seven years to be tried on charges of growing marijuana. And, of course, there is Kalief Browder, who waited without trial for three years at New York’s Rikers Island for allegedly stealing a backpack. He was never convicted, but ultimately committed suicide.</p>

<p>This week, my colleagues on The Post’s editorial board took aim at Virginia’s ongoing problem with drivers license suspensions over unpaid court debts.</p>

<p>The problem with laws that link the suspension of driver’s licenses to the failure to pay court debt was spotlighted in a recent report examining the practice in Virginia. The Legal Aid Justice Center found that, as of December 2017, nearly 1 million Virginians (974,349) had their licenses suspended at least in part due to court debt, and nearly two-thirds of those (638,003) were suspended solely for that reason. That translates into about 1 in 6 drivers in the commonwealth. Payment plans were found to be ineffective, because the underlying issue is not drivers’ willingness to pay fines but the fact that they simply don’t have the money.</p>

<p>Virginia unfortunately is not alone in suspending or revoking licenses to punish people for failure to pay court debt. A state-by-state analysis by the Legal Aid Justice Center last fall found that 43 states and the District of Columbia suspend driver’s licenses because of unpaid debt. Only four states require a determination of the person’s ability to pay. Some, such as Virginia, make the suspensions mandatory, while others, including the District and Maryland, allow for discretion, albeit automated systems make its use rare. Virtually all states that suspend licenses for unpaid debt do so indefinitely, with rules that prevent reinstatement until full payment is made.</p>

<p>What results is a vicious cycle. You can’t afford to pay an initial court fine for a parking ticket or a shoplifting charge, so you lose your license. That means you can’t drive to work or hold a job that requires a license — which makes you even less able to pay your court debt. If you drive without a license, you may get into more serious trouble. Meanwhile, you can’t drive your children to school or to their medical appointments.</p>

<p>This problem has received a lot of national attention, going back to the uprising in Ferguson, Mo. Unfortunately, states and municipalities (more the latter than the former) have become too dependent on the revenue. The media attention has spurred reform in some places, and questionable reforms in others, such as outsourcing debt collection to private companies. But many states and municipalities have been reluctant to change at all. Here at The Watch, we’ve noted that in Louisiana, the funding for public defender offices comes primarily from court fees — and only those convicted are assessed those fees. Perversely, this means that every time a public defender wins a case, it means less funding for that attorney’s office.</p>

<p>In some cities, outstanding government debt not only means revocation of a driver’s license but also can make it impossible to obtain occupational licenses for jobs such as cutting hair or driving a cab. So because someone owes the city money, the city has made it impossible for that person to earn the money to pay the city back. A recent North Carolina study found that over the past 20 years, court fees in that state have risen by 400 percent, which is probably why about 1 in 5 inmates at the county jail in Charlotte is incarcerated for failing to pay fines. In fact, since just 2010, nearly every state has raised or added court fees or fines.</p>

<p>Sadly, we’re now starting to see backlash against even the slow-moving and tepid reforms wrought by the reporting after Ferguson. Earlier this year, for example, Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked an Obama-era advisory to municipal judges to use restraint when imposing fines and fees on the poor, sending the poor to jail for not paying those fines and fees, and generally using the municipal court system as a source of revenue for local government. On cue, a Missouri state lawmaker recently introduced a bill that would reauthorize city judges to jail poor people for unpaid fines, essentially undoing the reforms won in St. Louis not long after they were enacted.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>President Trump accuses another political opponent of committing crimes. He of course has a long history of this, going back to the campaign. It’s easy to get used to this sort of thing. But we shouldn’t lose sight of what’s at stake. The chief law enforcement official in the country repeatedly accusing his critics and opponents of criminality is a dangerous thing. And it will be all the more dangerous if he begins doing it to his potential 2020 opponents.</p></li>

<li><p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrest a Kansas chemistry teacher who was about to take his daughter to school. He came here 30 years ago and overstayed his visa. He has no criminal record. He has three children. The Trump administration is preparing to deport him to Bangladesh.</p></li>

<li><p>The administration has also deported a Detroit father of two who was brought to the United States at age 10 and has also been here for almost 30 years. He and his wife have spent more than $100,000 trying to obtain legal citizenship for him. According to his supporters, he has no criminal record and has paid taxes every year.</p></li>

<li><p>In fact, arresting undocumented parents as they drop their children off at school seems to be an increasingly common tactic.</p></li>

<li><p>Other recent deportations or arrests and pending deportations: A green card veteran who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and was brought here at age 8 (he had a felony drug conviction); a single mom with three children who are U.S. citizens (her only crime was to lie about her status on a driver’s license application — her husband was deported for the same offense); two Salvadoran brothers who were detained when one went to notify immigration officials that he was just given a scholarship to play college soccer; a host of pro-immigration activists; and a Palestinian father of four who was brought here at age 17 and owned a successful small business in Youngstown, Ohio;</p></li>

<li><p>Meanwhile, Trump’s pick to head up ICE said that politicians in sanctuary cities should be arrested and charged with crimes.</p></li>

<li><p>The Treasury Department may soon lift Obama administration-era protections for banks that do business with marijuana businesses in states where the drug is legal.</p></li>

<li><p>We noted this story previously, but it’s worth archiving in Trump Watch: ICE will soon have access to a license-plate database with billions of photos showing the time and location of various vehicles. It’s a good reminder that it will be impossible to enforce the Trump administration’s ideal immigration policy without severe restrictions on the civil liberties of everyone, not just immigrants.</p></li>

<li><p>A California woman died while waiting on the State Department to approve a visa for her sister to come to the United States from Vietnam for a stem-cell transplant.</p></li>

<li><p>The Justice Department will oppose leniency for a Nashville man who served more than 20 years in prison for a drug crime and was released in 2016 under new sentencing guidelines. He had a spotless record in prison. But the federal government appealed, arguing that his criminal history as a juvenile precluded his release. Despite a federal judge’s opinion that he is completely rehabilitated, he now faces another 15 years in prison. (To be fair, the appeal of his release was initiated during the Obama administration. But the current administration could still recommend leniency.)</p></li>

<li><p>The Justice Department has effectively shut down an office that facilitated legal aid for the poor.</p></li>

<p>A Baltimore police vehicle in 2017 in Baltimore. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)</p>

<p>Back in the summer of 2016, the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division released the report from its investigation of the Baltimore Police Department. I wrote at the time that it was one of the worst such reports I’d ever seen. Still is. It described routine harassment and discrimination, habitual violations of constitutional rights, and little to no oversight, transparency or accountability. The report brought a sense of vindication for residents of Baltimore who have long complained about the city’s policing.</p>

<p>Critics, on the other hand, derided the report as politically motivated and anecdotal. In the New York Post, former NYPD officer Eugene O’Donnell called the report “a clueless hit job.” Conservatives claimed that the BPD couldn’t possibly enforce racist policies, because half the police department is black. (This betrays a pretty fundamental misunderstanding of structural racism.) The Daily Wire absurdly complained — with no evidence, other than a link to a rant by talk radio blusterer Mark Levin — that the report was just another effort by the Obama administration to nationalize the police: “Their real motivation is to expand their power into these local police departments so they can be molded to fit their leftist ideology.” Critic of cop critics Heather Mac Donald wrote that the report “is assiduously blind to, and silent about, the burdens faced by residents of high-crime neighborhoods,” and called it “just one more reckless attack on police legitimacy.”</p>

<p>But city officials appeared to take the report to heart. After Donald Trump was elected, Attorney General Jeff Sessions of course said he’d be rolling back these civil rights investigations of police departments. As a part of that new policy, the Justice Department said it would be reconsidering all of the consent decrees that local police departments had entered into with the Obama administration. But city officials — in Baltimore and elsewhere — then announced that they’d be moving ahead with those reforms anyway, with or without Justice oversight.</p>

<p>Content from Prime Video</p>

<p>So let’s cut back to the present. There’s currently a police corruption trial going on in Baltimore. Ex-cops are testifying at that trial. And man, they’re saying some things:</p>

<p>[Former detective Jemell] Rayam testified about a July 2016 robbery of a married couple who were handcuffed after leaving Home Depot and taken to a police substation nicknamed “The Barn,” even though there was no evidence they had committed any crime. The indictment alleges that Gun Trace Task Force supervisor Sgt. Wayne Jenkins posed as a federal official during their interrogation.</p>

<p>After Ronald Hamilton disclosed he had about $40,000 in cash at the couple’s house outside the city, Gun Trace Task Force detectives drove the handcuffed couple to their Carroll County property, called a relative to pick up their children, and then scoured the house looking for cash, according to Rayam.</p>

<p>Before detaining the couple, Jenkins submitted an affidavit asking for authorization to search the home based on phony surveillance that never took place.</p>

<p>They robbed $20,000 before calling other law enforcement agencies to the couple’s home, Rayam testified, saying he “took the cash and put it in the (police) vehicle we were driving.”</p>

<p>Maryland State Police was called to execute a search warrant because the Baltimore unit was outside the city and therefore this was an out-of-jurisdiction warrant for the detectives.</p>

<p>Prosecutors allege they just wanted to rob the couple based on suspicions they were drug dealers — not actual evidence.</p>

<p>Rayam testified the detectives divvied up the money and went celebrating that night at two casinos.</p>

<p>Another ex-detective testified that members of the same police unit robbed a home safe of $100,000, then staged video footage to make the police break-in appear legitimate.</p>

<p>It gets worse. Here are some other highlights from the trial, as reported by the Baltimore Sun:</p>

<p>• [Former detective Maurice] Ward testified that his squad would prowl the streets for guns and drugs, with his supervisor, Sgt. Wayne Jenkins, driving fast at groups of people and slamming on the brakes. The officers would pop their doors open to see who ran, then give chase and detain and search them. Ward said this occurred 10 to 20 times on slow nights, and more than 50 times, “easy,” on busier nights.</p>

<p>The officers had no reason to target the crowds other than to provoke someone who might have drugs or a gun into running.</p>

<p>• Ward said Jenkins liked to profile certain vehicles for traffic stops. Honda Accords, Acura TLs, Honda Odysseys were among the “dope boy cars” that they would pull over, claiming the drivers weren’t wearing seat belts or their windows were too heavily tinted. …</p>

<p>• Ward said the officers kept BB guns in their vehicles “in case we accidentally hit somebody or got into a shootout, so we could plant them.” He did not say whether the officers ever planted a BB gun on anyone. …</p>

<p>• Ward testified that he and [Marcus] Taylor once conducted a “trash run” on a home in preparation for obtaining a search warrant. They found marijuana residue in the target’s trash, but realized the trash can belonged to another resident. They proceeded anyway, submitting an affidavit for a search warrant falsely claiming the drugs had been found in the target’s trash can. …</p>

<p>• Rayam said the unit made regular use of illegal GPS trackers to follow suspects.</p>

<p>• Rayam said the officers once recovered a pound and a half of marijuana and a gun in a search conducted before they had secured a warrant. Jenkins told him to “just get rid of it,” and Rayam said he and another officer sold the drugs and gun back onto the street.</p>

<p>Keep in mind, these weren’t inexperience beat cops. This was one of the elite police units in the city. Also keep in mind that the only reason we know about all of this is because of — yes — a federal investigation.</p>

<p>This isn’t even the only BPD scandal to make headlines since the release of the Justice report. Just last week, a Baltimore police officer was indicted on charges of misconduct and fabricating evidence after body camera video showed him placing a soup can in a lot, walking away, and then going back and “discovering” a bag of white capsules in the can. It’s one of three incidents in which a BPD officer, unaware that body cameras begin recording about 30 seconds before they’re turned on, appears to have been caught by his own body camera either planting evidence or at the very least “recreating” how he found evidence so there’s video footage. (The first is obviously worse than the second, though both constitute tampering.) Prosecutors called the other two incidents an “error of judgment.”</p>

<p>In January, the Baltimore Sun reported that a police officer had given false testimony in a trial in December. A police spokesman said BPD learned about his testimony only when the Sun asked the department about it.</p>

<p>And then there’s the death of Baltimore Police Detective Sean Suiter. He was shot — with his own gun — a day before he was to give grand jury testimony as part of the federal investigation into the officers on the Gun Trace Task Force. The murder remains unsolved. The Sun reports, “It is the only line-of-duty killing in the agency’s history that is unsolved, with suspects apprehended on the scene or quickly identified through tips in previous cases.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the homicide rate in Baltimore continues to soar. Here’s a possible explanation, for which there seems to be growing evidence: Perhaps Baltimore residents fear their police department more than they fear the criminals.</p>

<p>Sessions once called Justice Department efforts to get cops to respect the rights of the people they serve “one of the most dangerous, and rarely discussed, exercises of raw power.” Again, just to be clear, Sessions wasn’t referring to the abuses committed by police. He was referring to the Justice Department’s efforts to rein them in. (Of course, Sessions has no problem with Justice coercing local police agencies into enforcing federal immigration laws — even when local police officials say that doing so impedes their ability to fight crime.)</p>

<p>I say we ask the victims of the BPD’s Gun Trace Task Force: Which was the more dangerous exercise of raw power, the police officers from that unit who robbed, framed and terrorized people all over Maryland (no, not just Baltimore), or the federal officials who brought those officers to justice?</p>

<h2 id="republicanspraisedreamerspubliclybutwantthemtoliveunderpermanentsuspicion">Republicans praise 'dreamers' publicly -- but want them to live under permanent suspicion</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-24</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/01/25/republicans-praise-dreamers-publicly-but-want-them-to-live-under-permanent-suspicion/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Demonstrators hold illuminated signs during a rally supporting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) outside the Capitol building last week in Washington. (Zach Gibson/Bloomberg News)</p>

<p>In a meeting with congressional leaders a few weeks ago, President Trump famously said he wanted a DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) “bill of love.” Of course, he said a lot of things at that meeting that he didn’t back up. But just this week, Trump said he is open to a path to citizenship for “dreamers” in 10 to 12 years. Last year, dreamer Angelica Villalobos asked House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) whether she should fear being deported once the new administration took over. He told her she did not, adding “I hope your future is here.” She’s back in the news this week, challenging Ryan on his promise.</p>

<p>Publicly, Republicans tend to say nice things about dreamers. These, remember, are young adults who were brought to the United States as children. They must be educated and of “good moral character,” meaning they can’t have committed a serious crime. To participate in the program, they volunteered their names, status and contact information to the government. They’re now in a kind of limbo, unsure if Trump and the Congress will cut a deal for them, or if they’ll be deported back to a country they’ve never known.</p>

<p>The reason Republicans say nice things about dreamers in public is that they’re an incredibly sympathetic group. And they have the support of the public. Polls have consistently shown that majorities between 65 percent and 85 percent support keeping the dreamers here in the United States, either through permanent resident status or via some pathway to citizenship. But hard-line immigration hawks do not. Hawks such as White House adviser Stephen Miller, who has been hating immigrants since high school, and Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who — let’s face it — is an unapologetic bigot, don’t see dreamers as the public does. If they can’t deport them, they’re at least determined to use the dreamers as a bargaining chip to impose severe restrictions on legal immigration, slash refugee quotas and increase the percentage of immigrants from, as Trump infamously put it, countries like Norway, as opposed to Mexico, Haiti or Nigeria. Trump budget director Mick Mulvaney put it pretty bluntly this week. When asked what Trump’s ideal policy on dreamers would look like, Mulvaney responded that it “depends on what we get in exchange.” These aren’t people with lives, hopes, dreams and fears. They’re merely chits the White House could use to whiten up the immigration pool.</p>

<p>Content from Prime Video</p>

<p>And so while Trump, Ryan and other GOP leaders praise the dreamers on camera, when it comes to crafting legislation, it’s the hard-liners who take over. A great example is the Securing America’s Future Act, a GOP DACA bill in the House that apparently has White House support. The bill would indeed grant dreamers a legal, non-immigrant status, which they could renew in perpetuity. That’s great. But the Cato Institute’s David Bier some found some nasty other provisions buried in the 414-page bill. For example, the bill would make it nearly impossible for refugees to even apply for asylum unless they’ve already secured an attorney in the United States. For most people fleeing war zones or political persecution, that just isn’t an option. It would also mandate the most severe cuts to legal immigration in nearly a century.</p>

<p>But here’s the nugget Bier found that’s most outrageous:</p>

<p>The worst enforcement provision is criminalizing simply being in the United States without status or violating any aspect of civil immigration law (p. 170). This would turn millions of unauthorized immigrants into criminals overnight. It would also criminalize legal immigrants who fail to update their addresses, carry their green card with them at all times, or otherwise abide by the million inane regulations that Congress imposes on them.</p>

<p>Instant criminalization of millions of people. That’s a lot of new customers for those privatized immigration detention centers. (The private prison industry, incidentally, donated handsomely to Trump’s campaign and inauguration. Just a coincidence, I’m sure.) And then there’s this, which says all we need to know about what the bill’s sponsors really think of dreamers:</p>

<p>Take, for example, the status provided to Dreamers in this bill. It requires them to maintain an annual income of at least 125 percent of the poverty line (p. 396). If they fall below that level for 90 days—not only are they subject to deportation again—they would be criminals. This bill literally criminalizes poverty among Dreamers.</p>

<p>Bier elaborates on this provision in a subsequent post.</p>

<p>Under this bill, the law wouldn’t view dreamers as prospective U.S. citizens. It wouldn’t view them productive members of society. Under this bill, the state would perpetually be looking over every dreamer’s shoulder. It’s perpetual probation. Should they be struck down by illness or an accident, encounter a bad boss, take the wrong job or experience some other sort of bad luck, they risk not only deportation but criminal prosecution.</p>

<p>Immigrants in general, and dreamers in particular, contribute far more to the economy than they take from it. No matter. It’s clear that this bill’s sponsors and supporters see dreamers no differently from the dehumanizing caricature that hard-line immigration opponents project of immigrants generally: In the end, they’re just foreigners in search of handouts. No matter how educated, how credentialed, how ambitious, they’ll never shake that suspicion. This bill would codify that suspicion into law. And again, dreamers wouldn’t even need to try to obtain public assistance to bring the law down upon them. Simply being poor for a short period of time would be enough.</p>

<p>Dreamers were brought here at a young age, and not of their own volition. Because of their status, they’ve lived precariously yet managed to avoid trouble. They’ve educated themselves. Most have entered the workforce. They then trusted our goodwill when they volunteered for the DACA program. They agreed to let the government know who they were. They tried to get right with the law, despite the law’s indifference to their history. Now they watch and wait as politicians treat them like a stack of poker chips.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump and the Republicans attempt to earn public goodwill by praising these young people in public, while in private they push legislation that would, for their rest of their lives, tell them that the United States will allow them to remain here, but only begrudgingly, and only if they agree to live under a permanent cloud of suspicion.</p>

<h2 id="levonbrooksamississippimanwronglyconvictedbybadforensicsdiesat58">Levon Brooks, a Mississippi man wrongly convicted by bad forensics, dies at 58</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-25</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/01/26/levon-brooks-a-mississippi-man-wrongly-convicted-by-bad-forensics-dies-at-58/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Levon Brooks died earlier this week. Brooks and Kennedy Brewer were convicted of the separate rapes and murders of two little girls in the early 1990s in Noxubee County, Miss. They were convicted primarily because of the testimony of forensic witnesses Steven Hayne and Michael West. Hayne found marks on the bodies that he thought were human bite marks. West then confirmed and matched the marks first to Brooks and then to Brewer. These are the two wrongful convictions that drive my forthcoming book, which I co-wrote with Tucker Carrington, director of the George C. Cochran Mississippi Innocence Project. So I’ve come to learn quite a bit about Brooks’s life and what a remarkable man he was.</p>

<p>Brooks was convicted just as he was settling into a new job that he loved, at a local club where he served as bouncer, cook, greeter, parking attendant and whatever else needed doing. He had also just learned that he was about to have a daughter. He served 18 years. He told me a couple years ago that he was determined not to let prison change the man he saw himself to be. He would survive, but with cunning and charm, not with violence. Levon got a job as a cook at Parchman Penitentiary, which he leveraged to win favor with his fellow inmates. He used his flare for art to draw greeting cards, then sold them to prison staff to send to their relatives. He then used all of that favor he’d earned to help other inmates he could tell were struggling. He was a decent man.</p>

<p>Brooks was finally exonerated in 2008. Years later, he was given a $50,000 per year stipend for his wrongful incarceration. He gave much of it away, and remained living with his fiancee (later to become his wife) in their modest home in rural Noxubee County. His one splurge: He and his wife opened a tiny little restaurant behind their house. On weekends, they’d invite the neighborhood to watch football during the day. At night, everyone danced. A couple years ago, he and Dinah got married there.</p>

<p>Brooks was strong — he had to be. But he was also empathetic. He and Brewer were convicted of separate crimes that were committed by another man. They were finally exonerated when that man was identified through DNA testing, and who then confessed to both crimes. When the real killer was arraigned, Brooks and Brewer went to the hearing. Brewer, quite understandably, had planned to ask that the state seek the death penalty. Brooks talked Brewer out of that. They didn’t know who this man was. They knew nothing about why he did what he did. (It turns out he may have had undiagnosed schizophrenia.) Brooks knew the little girl he was accused of killing. He had dated her mother. This man was responsible not only for raping and killer that little girl but also for Brooks’s subsequent incarceration. Yet if the system could make a mistake with him, it could make mistakes with others. He wanted no part of an execution. That speaks volumes about the kind of man he was.</p>

<p>Just a few months before he died, Brooks and Brewer lost their lawsuit against Hayne and West, the forensics “experts” whose testimony sealed the two convictions. The federal appeals court found that while the two experts may have been grossly negligent, they were protected by qualified immunity. It was a cruel blow to two men who had already endured far more than their fair share of cruelty.</p>

<p>And yet Brooks was a joyous man and incredibly charismatic. He had a way of drawing you in, of quickly making you feel like an old friend. Within minutes of my meeting him, he was already making plans for he and I to go hunting. The last time I saw him, he told me that he was happy — that for the first time since getting out of prison, he felt as happy as he’d been before he went in. It was an odd thing to hear, because just a few minutes earlier, he had shown me the chemo pump attached to his abdomen.</p>

<p>Levon Brooks’s life was unfair — incredibly, cruelly, unspeakably unfair. Somehow, against all odds, he still found joy in it.</p>

<p>Now that marijuana is finally legal for recreational use in the state of California, here at The Watch we’ve been looking at the drug’s history in the state — how it has been used, regulated and prohibited. In the first post, we looked at the origins of marijuana and cannabis prohibition, going back to the early 20th century. For this post, we’ll pick it back up in the late 1960s, as Richard Nixon begins his crusade against illicit substances and, in his 1968 campaign, ushers in the modern drug war. (I’ll note here that because my first book, “Rise of the Warrior Cop,” looks at the history of the contemporary drug war as the driver of police militarization, portions of this post are heavily borrowed from my book.)</p>

<p>The rise of the 1960s counterculture spurred a backlash on the right, and with it a desire for more aggressive, confrontational drug-war policing. One of the earliest casualties of the modern drug war I’ve been able to find is the death of Heyward Dyer in October 1969. Early in the morning, a team of police from the California State Bureau of Narcotics, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department and the nearby town of Vernon launched a pre-dawn, no-knock pot raid on an apartment in the city of Whittier.</p>

<p>They had raided the wrong apartment and instead frightened a 50-year-old woman and her 12-year-old daughter. Dyer was married to that woman’s older daughter. He and his wife lived upstairs, along with their 22-month-old son. Dyer woke up to screaming and commotion, and went downstairs to see what was going on. He was met with several police guns pointed at him. They told him to return to his apartment upstairs. He did. As the police then began to raid the second apartment, Dyer’s went down to check on her mother and sister, and handed the 22-month-old off to her husband. During the subsequent raid, one of the officers fired his rifle into the ceiling. The bullet went through the floor where Dyer was standing, struck him and killed him as he held his son. The raid turned up four pills the police believed to be narcotics and 150 marijuana seeds.</p>

<p>By the early 1970s, the counterculture had come to Northern California, particularly in what would become known as the “Emerald Triangle,” or Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity counties. The climate made the area particularly suited for growing marijuana, and the forested mountains made it ideal for growing it illegally. But the pot/hippie culture didn’t sit well with the conservative natives. Local law enforcement in particular dreaded the influx of “longhairs,” and some suspected them for a series of arsons in the area. They began a more aggressive crackdown on marijuana.</p>

<p>Nearly a year to the day after the death of Heyward Dyer, another casualty, this time at the opposite end of the state. In October 1970, a Humboldt County deputy shot and killed 22-year-old Patrick Berti. The recent college grad was headed to law school soon. Just before he left, he took a walk with a friend along the Eel River to see two pot plants that the friend had planted. But local deputies had already spotted the plants and had spent days staking them out, waiting for their owner to return. When the two young men stopped at the plants, the deputy jumped from the brush. Berti at the time was holding a twig in his hand. The deputy would later claim he mistook it for a gun. He fired his service weapon, striking and killing Berti.</p>

<p>Through the 1970s, the state would see a ratcheting-up of drug-war efforts during the Nixon years, followed by a modest move toward reform in the middle and latter half of the decade. In 1972, voters rejected a decriminalization proposition by a two-thirds majority. Legislative efforts to reduce penalties for possession of the drug were regularly met with the threat of veto by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan. But after Reagan left office in 1975, the legislature passed the Moscone Act, which made possession of an ounce or less of pot a misdemeanor instead of a felony. That’s about where things would remain until Reagan was elected president in 1980, after which he’d put the federal boot to California.</p>

<p>Still fighting the culture wars, Reagan and his advisers decided early on that marijuana was the biggest drug threat facing the country. And so a couple of years into his first term, federal and California officials came up with a battle plan to target cultivation in the northern part of the state. The phrase “battle plan” isn’t much of an exaggeration here. Here’s how I described the operation in my book:</p>

<p>The project was called the Campaign Against Marijuana Production, or CAMP. It was a joint operation dreamed up by Carlton Turner and California attorney general John Van de Kamp. The plan: bring in the National Guard to search for, find, and eradicate the marijuana fields popping up all over northern California. The program began in the summer of 1983, when the federal government sent U-2 spy planes to glide over the area in search of pot …</p>

<p>Then they sent the helicopters. In all, thirteen California counties were invaded by choppers, some of them blaring Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries” as they dropped Guardsmen and law enforcement officers armed with automatic weapons, sandviks, and machetes into the fields of California …</p>

<p>In CAMP’s first year, the program conducted 524 raids, arrested 128 people, and seized about 65,000 marijuana plants. Operating costs ran at a little over $1.5 million. The next year, 24 more sheriffs signed up for the program, for a total of 37. CAMP conducted 398 raids, seized nearly 160,000 plants, and made 218 arrests at a cost to taxpayers of $2.3 million. The area’s larger growers had been put out of business (or, probably more accurately, had set up shop somewhere else), so by the start of the second campaign in 1984, CAMP officials were already targeting increasingly smaller growers. By the end of that 1984 campaign, the helicopters had to fly at lower and lower altitudes to spot smaller batches of plants. The noise, wind, and vibration from the choppers could knock out windows, kick up dust clouds, and scare livestock. The officials running the operation made no bones about the paramilitary tactics they were using. They considered the areas they were raiding to be war zones. In the interest of “officer safety,” they gave themselves permission to search any structures relatively close to a marijuana supply, without a warrant. Anyone coming anywhere near a raid operation was subject to detainment, usually at gunpoint.</p>

<p>Here’s how the journalist Dan Baum describes the operation in his essential drug war history “Smoke and Mirrors: The War on Drugs and the Politics of Failure“:</p>

<p>For a solid month, the clatter of helicopters was never absent from Humboldt County. CAMP roadblocks started hauling whole families out of cars and holding them at gunpoint while searching their vehicles without warrants. CAMP troops … went house to house kicking in doors and ransacking homes, again without warrants. Van de Kamp bolstered the raiding squads with LA policemen who, Van de Kamp knew, looked on two weeks of raiding hippie shacks in Humboldt County as “summer camp” … They’d kick apart [homes], wave guns at the terrified owners, and storm off in a could of dust and helicopter exhaust …</p>

<p>A CAMP team rousted a family from their home at gunpoint and shot their dog. A CAMP helicopter chased a nine-year-old girl down a dirt road and pointed guns at her … CAMP troops were searching without warrants not only the homes of suspected growers but also all the neighbors’ homes as well, ostensibly to “protect themselves.” Once inside, the troops would empty the refrigerator, pilfer what they wanted, and leave empty beer cans on sofas and counters … The citizens of the county, who had first welcomed CAMP as a way to get rid of dangerous lawbreakers, now viewed the operation as an occupying army.</p>

<p>The activist and author Arnold Trebach writes in his book “The Great Drug War” that federal officials deemed the entire town of Denny, Calif., to be a haven for drug dealers. They decided it needed to be captured. Denny residents Eric Masett and his wife Rebecca Sue told Trebach that when they pulled out of their driveway during a CAMP raid in 1983, six men dressed in camouflage pointed rifles at them. The couple fled back into the town, where CAMP officials had put up roadblocks to keep everyone in place while they conducted house-to-house searches — all without warrants. When CAMP left, a military-like convoy pulled out from the small village, guns still trained on the townspeople as they left. The couple told Trebach that as the convoy finally exited Denny, its members chanted, “War on drugs! War on drugs!”</p>

<p>Trebach documented other examples from the CAMP campaign in his book. One helicopter zeroed in on a man while he was relieving himself in an outhouse, blowing open the door. Agents later entered his house without a warrant and confiscated a rifle he owned legally. Another woman who described herself as a “conservative Republican” wrote in a journal she kept during the raids. “They came again this morning at about 8:00 o’clock,” she wrote. “A large cargo-type helicopter flew low over the cabin, shaking it on its very foundations. It shook all of us inside, too. I feel frightened … I see how helpless and tormented I am becoming with disgust and disillusionment with the government which has turned this beautiful country into a police state … I feel like I am in the middle of a war zone.” Another woman described a helicopter chasing her 12-year-old daughter and another girl. “It seems that we are in Vietnam or Nicaragua,” she told Trebach. “They saw guns, and thought they were going to be shot!”</p>

<p>A U.S. postal worker was at home preparing dinner with her 5-year-old son and a male friend when she heard a convoy of CAMP troops outside. As she walked out, shots rang out from the hillside. It was a rural area, so the sound of gunshots was common. But the CAMP warriors jumped from their trucks, weapons at the ready. One of them screamed at the woman to “get moving.” She replied that she was standing on her own property. One officer then put a rifle to her head, called her an “asshole” and told her that if he heard another shot, he’d “open up” on her home. He then put the muzzle of his gun inches away from her friend’s mouth. “If there’s going to be any shooting around here, I’m going to be the first son of a bitch to open up on all you motherf—–s.”</p>

<p>On April 12, 1985, U.S. District Judge Robert Aguilar finally issued an injunction against CAMP’s more aggressive tactics. The judge was alarmed to learn that the written directives by which the program operated gave law enforcement “virtually unbridled discretion to enter and search private property anywhere in the vicinity of an eradication raid, and to seize personal property and detain innocent citizens without probable cause or even reasonable suspicion of any criminal activity.” In other words, these weren’t some rogue cops acting out. This was all by design. Aguilar barred CAMP personnel from entering any property other than an open field without a warrant, and from entering any property adjacent to an open field without a warrant unless there were clear exigent circumstances. He also barred CAMP helicopters from flying within 500 feet of any person, house or vehicle, and assigned a retired judge to monitor the program to ensure CAMP officials complied with the order.</p>

<p>But even Aguilar couldn’t stop the abuse if state judges were willing to issue broad search warrants. Just a few months after his ruling, for example, a state judge signed a sweeping search warrant allowing CAMP officials to search a square quarter-mile of land — and the eight homes on it — for six suspected marijuana plants. The CAMP troops emptied the homes and assembled 12 people on the front lawn of one of the houses. The residents were held at gunpoint for several hours as the troops then searched the homes and the surrounding woods for the pot plants. A Vietnam vet told Trebach that the whole episode reminded him of the war. He also told Trebach he supported drug prohibition. He was just appalled at the way CAMP was enforcing it.</p>

<p>In a raid that managed to make national news, on the morning of March 8, 1985, at about 6 a.m., 60 law enforcement officers staged a raid on the large Mendocino County ranch owned by Bill Hay and his wife Karen. I wrote about the raid for the Huffington Post in 2013:</p>

<p>When Hay answered the loud knock at the door, he told a local paper, a federal agent “threw some papers in my face . . . while he held a gun up [my] nose.” Hay’s wife and son Robert were already awake, and also held at gunpoint. His son Richard was rousted from sleep with a gun pressed to his temple. Within minutes dozens of camouflage-clad narcotics cops from at least seven local, state, and federal police agencies fanned out over the Hays’ 11,000 acre farm. The raid included 14 vehicles, two ambulances, two aircraft, and a “lunch wagon” — in case the raiding cops worked up an appetite.</p>

<p>The raid was based on a tip from a confidential informant, who told police that the Hay ranch was the site of a massive underground drug warehouse, where they’d find stacks of marijuana bales and crates of cocaine, all packaged and ready for sale. After six hours of searching, they found nothing of the kind. The agent in charge then ordered a search of the Hay house. The drug cops ransacked the place, rifling through drawers and cabinets, apparently in the hope that Bill Hay was hiding an enormous drug storage facility in his sock drawer. They finally brought in drug dogs to sniff every inch of the Hay household. They found no contraband.</p>

<p>In all, the Hays were held at gunpoint for eight hours, during which they were not permitted to talk, eat or drink, change out of their bedclothes, or use the toilet. The Hays said several SWAT members mocked them as they ate lunch in front of them, and at one point, began simulating intercourse with a plastic deer lawn ornament on the family’s front lawn. The warrant allowed the team to look not just for drugs, but for “paraphernalia” used to harvest and package illegal drugs. At one point, a narcotics officer demanded to know why Hay was in possession of a large supply of baling wire. Hay pointed out that he kept a thousand head of cattle, 900 sheep, and had a baler in the barn. He then pointed to his huge of supply of hay, stacked in bales.</p>

<p>Finally, the police flew their informant to the Hay ranch, where he told them they had raided the wrong property. The Hays would later learn that the informant — described on the warrant as trustworthy and reliable — had previously told police the ranch was in Sonoma County.</p>

<p>Three years later, a jury would rule in favor of the Hay family and award them $8 million in damages. One juror told the Ukiah Daily Journal that the Hays’ account of the raid reminded him of the stories his father told him about life in Nazi-occupied Holland. California Deputy State Attorney General Paul Hammerness would later call the judge who ruled the search warrant invalid a “villain” and said the jury award was unjustified because “the Hays really weren’t damaged.” This, after all, was a war.</p>

<p>The mid-to-late 1980s brought the crack epidemic, which hit few places as hard as it hit Southern California. Here too, there’s a connection to pot. Both Baum and the journalist Ryan Grim have convincingly argued that the rise of crack can be blamed at least in part on the Reagan administration’s decision (and to a lesser extent the Carter administration) to target marijuana. The drug war has never succeeded in eradicating a popular drug, of course, and from the user end, marijuana and crack aren’t remotely similar. But the government can disrupt supply enough to raise the price of a particular drug. Raise it enough, and dealers will begin to switch to another product, even if that means finding new customers. It’s probably of no coincidence, then, that the price of marijuana began to rise just as crack emerged. And crack was a product that was cheap, easy to produce and a lot more addictive. In 2012, Grim interviewed the notorious 1980s kingpin Rick Ross, who made this very point:</p>

<p>“I wanted to sell pot. You couldn’t get pot at a decent price — I couldn’t, nor the quantity,” said Rick Ross, whose operation the Los Angeles Times dubbed “the Wal-Mart of crack dealing.” Ross built one of the largest cocaine empires in the country, expanding his operation to at least a dozen major cities.</p>

<p>“I could get a pound here, a pound here, once in awhile a few additional pounds, but I couldn’t get a constant, steady, good-price pot [connection]. You just couldn’t get it in the early ‘80s, when I was selling coke,” he said. Prosecutors estimated Ross made some $600 million over the course of his career. …</p>

<p>“What I learned about weed is that weed is a more profitable business than cocaine. More people use it. You get it cheaper per pound. And it carries less amount of time,” Ross said. “We just couldn’t buy it. It wasn’t price, because I had the money to buy whatever I wanted. So it wasn’t the price. It wasn’t available. It was a market I was shut out of.”</p>

<p>If Ross felt that way, it’s likely other dealers did too. And Grim found data to support the contention.</p>

<p>A confessed inability to find a steady supply of marijuana might sound strange coming from a drug kingpin, but it dovetails with a broader trend at the time. For the book “This Is Your Country On Drugs,” I looked at pricing data from the late ‘70s and ‘80s and found a remarkable divergence: As the price of pot skyrocketed, the price of cocaine plummeted. …</p>

<p>The Drug Enforcement Administration’s stated drug policy goal is to reduce supply so that price rises, which in theory will depress demand. But what happens in reality is that demand to get high simply goes elsewhere.</p>

<p>The movement in price was a direct result of policy put into place by President Jimmy Carter, then massively expanded by his successor, President Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p>Carter expanded a joint Mexican-American venture called Operation Condor, aimed at eradicating Mexican pot that had been supplied since 1975. American planes sprayed tons of herbicide on Mexican crops to kill pot plants. … “Tons of drugs were destroyed, production was reduced, prices rose, but drugs continued to flow into the American market, although in lesser quantity of Mexican origin,” writes sociologist Luís Astorga in the paper “Drug Trafficking in Mexico: A First General Assessment.”</p>

<p>The action had several consequences. One, a rise in the price of pot in the United States, was intended. Others weren’t. The growth of domestic marijuana farming might have eased pot shortages slightly during the ‘70s, but the industry was hardly the high-tech, high-efficiency bud-producing machine it is today. The encouragement of a shift from pot to cocaine importation among drug smugglers was a much more significant development in the short term. Coke, more valuable by weight and with a less detectable odor, was more profitable and much easier to move. …</p>

<p>Reagan redoubled efforts at curbing imports, further militarized drug policy and brought about mandatory-minimum sentences for minor drug offenses. In 1980, the FBI’s Uniform Crime Report lists fewer than 100,000 arrests for heroin and cocaine, which are tabulated together. By 1989, that figure had jumped to more than 700,000.</p>

<p>So as the state and federal governments pummeled Northern California with helicopters, National Guardsmen and gun-toting drug warriors, doing so likely helped create the epidemic that would soon devastate Southern California and a good deal of the rest of the country.</p>

<p>And all of this — the unnecessary deaths, the rampant militarism, the mass violations of basic rights and civil liberties — were to eradicate a drug that California, seven other states and the District of Columbia have now determined is safe for recreational use. And today, the Emerald Triangle — the area invaded by federal helicopters, spy planes and Fourth Amendment-free zones — is the largest cannabis-producing region in the United States.</p>

<p>Next time, we’ll look at the 1990s and the medical marijuana movement.</p>

<h2 id="citysayswhitejurywasmotivatedbyracialbiaswhenrulingagainstcopswhokilledunarmedblackman">City says white jury was motivated by racial bias when ruling against cops who killed unarmed black man</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-15</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/01/16/city-says-white-jury-was-motivated-by-racial-bias-when-ruling-against-cops-who-killed-unarmed-black-man/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>This is quite the excerpt from a recent opinion written by federal district court judge Barbara Rothstein:</p>

<p>“Zaro and Wiley orchestrated an operation, executed in critical part by Markert, whereby an unarmed man who was negotiating the temporary release of his four-year-old son to the boy’s grandmother was subject to an explosive breach of his back door, shot in his abdomen, and then repeatedly punched in the face while he died, despite having never threatened violence to anyone that night.”</p>

<p>Police Chief Mike Zaro, Officer Mike Wiley and Sgt. Brian Markert are officers in Lakewood, Wash. The man they killed was Leonard Thomas. They were at his home on that night in 2013 because Thomas’s mother called police after the two had an argument about where Thomas’s son would spend the night. Thomas had been drinking and was apparently despondent over the recent death of a friend. His mother called the police out of fear for his safety. They did what you’d think would be unimaginable at a time when someone was clearly in the midst of a mental health crisis: They sent a SWAT team. There was no reason to believe Thomas was armed. He said he wasn’t. And he was telling the truth. As Rothstein points out, he also hadn’t threatened violence against anyone, save for slapping a cellphone out of his mother’s hand.</p>

<p>But SWAT teams aren’t psychiatrists. SWAT teams are groups of police officers who are trained to use overwhelming force and violence to subdue a threat. Predictably, this SWAT team did not do what a psychiatrist would do; they did what SWAT teams do.</p>

<p>A hostage negotiator had persuaded him to let the child go home with his mother and was standing on the front porch with the boy, a car seat and a backpack full of clothes when Zaro told the SWAT team not to allow him to go back inside with the child and gave Wiley approval to breach the back door with explosives.</p>

<p>The blast startled Thomas, and when he reached for the child, Markert shot him.</p>

<p>Later, Markert would file a report — with the help of an attorney — that referred to the child as a hostage more than 100 times and insisted Thomas was trying to strangle the child.</p>

<p>Rothstein said the jury clearly concluded otherwise.</p>

<p>“But [the child] was not a hostage, and Markert and the other officers here were not attempting to separate him from a kidnapper,” she said. “Rather, they were attempting to remove a child from his parent without the parent’s consent” and at the cost of the parent’s life.</p>

<p>And now that child has no father. A jury recently awarded Thomas’s family $15.1 million.</p>

<p>But that passage isn’t the most outrageous part of the story. Thomas, it turns out, was black. The attorneys for the city argued that the jury’s verdict should be set aside because it was motivated by racial prejudice. Specifically, they argued that the jury, which had no black members, was afraid to rule against cops accused of killing a black man. The Seattle Times quotes city attorney Richard Jolley, who at a court hearing said of the jurors, “they weren’t going to go back to their individual communities and tell the people that they associate with, we found in favor of cops that shot an unarmed black man.”</p>

<p>So just to be clear, the city attorney is arguing that a white jury was acting with racial prejudice when it ruled against police officers who killed a black man. Here are some facts from the real world: Juries almost never rule against police officers. Juries also tend to be biased against black people. Juries with no black members tend to be especially problematic on both counts.</p>

<p>Rothstein was not impressed with the city’s argument. From the Seattle Times article:</p>

<p>“Without any evidence — without any factual foundation whatsoever — defendants have chosen to malign one of this country’s most sacred civic institutions, the impartially selected petit jury,” she said.</p>

<p>“The suggestion that this jury flouted its charge and colluded to hold government officials liable merely to advance the jurors’ individual reputations is not simply frivolous; it is insulting to our constitutional order,” she wrote.</p>

<p>“And the notion that the American justice system can be characterized by an illegitimate solicitude for black victims of alleged police misconduct is so painfully ahistorical that one wonders whether Defendants advance this argument seriously,” she said.</p>

<p>She found the argument particularly vexing, she said, since it was the defense that successfully persuaded her to preclude showing prospective jurors a video about unconscious bias, that they helped pick and approved the jury, and “notwithstanding the fact, should it even matter, that none of the jurors were African American.”</p>

<p>There is a case to be made that the city attorney’s job is to help his client win and to utilize whatever arguments and legal strategies might help accomplish that. Clearly, Jolley miscalculated with this particular strategy. But even if it had been successful, the city was never obligated to fight this verdict. City officials could have conceded before the trial that the police had responded poorly to this particular situation, offered Thomas’s family a settlement, and then implemented changes to policies and procedures to prevent something similar from happening again. They also could have accepted the jury’s verdict. That they instead proceeded to fight, and to then utilize arguments that are insulting to the city’s black residents, the non-black residents on the jury, and, frankly, anyone with a passing knowledge of the history of police abuse cases, or of the criminal-justice system in general, is a decision that can be — and begs to be — criticized.</p>

<p>As of last week, recreational marijuana is legal in California. And at about the same time legalization took effect, Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared to be flirting with a federal crackdown on those states that have legalized the drug.</p>

<p>California, of course, is not the first state to legalize the drug for recreational use, but it has generally been out in front of public policy shifts when it comes to marijuana. So now seems like a good time to look back at the state’s fascinating history with pot. Perhaps there are some lessons to be learned from that history.</p>

<p>California was among the first states to prohibit cannabis. At the height of the temperance movement, California then toughened the penalties for possessing and selling the drug. During the mid-20th-century reefer madness, it toughened them again. As attitudes about marijuana relaxed in the 1970s, the state correspondingly relaxed those penalties. By the 1980s, the country was in the midst of a reactionary tough-on-crime wave, and California was at the fore. It was then the first state to legalize medical marijuana in the 1990s. California was home to the Haight-Ashbury counterculture movement, the Grateful Dead and Cheech &amp; Chong. It’s also the home state of Richard Nixon, who birthed the modern drug war, and Ronald Reagan, the president who made Nixon’s war metaphor all too literal. Today, we’ll look at cannabis in California up until about the late 1960s.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, California was among the first states to prohibit cannabis — a 1913 amendment to the state’s Poison Act made possession of the drug a misdemeanor. But oddly, as Dale Gieringer writes in his paper on the origin of cannabis prohibition in the state, that law doesn’t appear to have been in response to any notable use of the drug. In fact, if you wanted to ingest cannabis in early-20th-century California, you’d have had a tough time finding it. Spanish colonials did grow hemp in the state, a tradition that continued until the early 1800s. But hemp was grown only for fiber, and there’s no indication that cannabis was cultivated for its psychoactive properties.</p>

<p>By the end of the 19th century, hemp production had all but ceased, and there were few references to hemp, cannabis or marijuana to be found. For his paper, Gieringer scoured news archives, literature, state records and medical publications, and found only a sprinkling of references to ingestion of cannabis of any form in the state, either as a psychoactive drug or for medical purposes. At the time, the drug was primarily consumed in the form of hashish, but not so much in California. There were news accounts of hashish houses and clubs in the East going back to the 1890s, but news mentions of the drug west of the Mississippi were sparse.</p>

<p>Of course, California did have plenty of opium. In the mid-1800s, the state saw an influx of Chinese immigrants, first in response to the gold rush, and then to work on the railroad. The immigrants brought opium, which quickly grew popular in cities and mining towns. California cities began banning opium and opium dens in the 1870s. The statewide ban came in 1881. Of course, opium was by no means limited to the Chinese community, but a surge of anti-immigrant fervor came to associate them and Asian immigrants in general with not just opium but also intoxicants in general. News stories about a rise in the use of some exotic drug inevitably linked the drug to immigrants of Asian descent, usually with plenty of exaggeration and wild-eyed wonder.</p>

<p>One of the few newspaper accounts Gieringer found of hashish in the state, for example, was an 1895 article in the San Francisco Call about an alleged hashish farm in Stockton. The article called hashish “the opium of Arabs” and used the terms Arab, Turkish and Armenian interchangeably. (Gieringer wrote that the immigrants in question were likely Syrian.) Gieringer noted that this farm quickly disappeared from the news and “no more mentions of hashish are to be found in California newspapers until after its prohibition in 1913.”</p>

<p>The term marijuana (or marihuana) comes from Mexico, and originally referred only to ingestion of the plant by smoking its leaves. That, too, was rare in California at the time but was common in Mexico. Here too, Gieringer found only a handful of news references to the drug during the late 1800s and early 1900s, but what he found tended to be cartoonish depictions that would foreshadow the press accounts to come. One 1895 article, also in the San Francisco Call, reported that prison officials in southern Arizona were growing concerned about the “seductive mariguana [sic].” The paper called the drug “more powerful than opium” and fretted that it “produces a hilarious sprit in the smoker that cannot be equaled by any other form of dissipation.”</p>

<p>A decade later, depictions of the drug grew more colorful still. One California medical publication noted that as use of the drug had spread through Mexico, “many are the wild orgies it has produced.” It warned that the habitual marijuana user “finally loses his mind and becomes a raving maniac,” adding that “it is said that those who smoke marihuana frequently die suddenly.” A few year later, the same publication warned that smoking the drug produces “a species of insanity which frequently ends in a horrible death.”</p>

<p>In 1905, the Los Angeles Times published the most frightful report yet. “Marihuana is a weed used only by people of the lower class, and sometimes by soldiers,” the report warned, and “the drug leaves … the smoker wilder than a wild beast.” It went on: “Everything … takes the shape of a monster, and men look like devils … People who smoke marihuana finally lose their mind and never recover it, but their brains dry up and they die, most of the time suddenly.”</p>

<p>A 1911 report that ran in several publications (including The Post) claimed that marijuana “destroys body, soul and mind” and that a third of the population of Mexico was “more or less addicted to use of the drug.”</p>

<p>And yet for the most part, marijuana was mostly unheard of in California. Gieringer argues that the state banned cannabis in 1913 not in response to an epidemic of spontaneous orgies or men in the shape of monsters, but because a public health official, Henry J. Finger, seemed oddly fixated on the drug. Here too, anti-immigrant sentiment was a likely motivator. In a 1911 letter to a colleague, for example, Finger fretted about an “influx of Hindoos,” whom he called “a very undesirable lot,” and, he claimed, had an insatiable appetite for cannabis. Gieringer could find no contemporaneous references to Hindu cannabis use in the state. He speculates that Finger was likely referring to group of East Indian Sikhs who had arrived in San Francisco the year before. Their arrival only stoked anti-Asian sentiment in the state and sparked an immediate backlash. But it’s doubtful the Sikhs were using cannabis, either. The religion opposes smoking and consumption of alcohol, Gieringer notes, and while they were targets of some ugly bigotry, drug use wasn’t a common accusation. Nevertheless, aided by the media reports such as those above, Finger’s fear-mongering was successful. The California legislature approved the amendment to prohibit cannabis by a unanimous vote.</p>

<p>The first arrests came the following year. The Los Angeles Times reported in 1914 that police had confiscated $500 worth of marijuana from a property in a Mexican neighborhood. Helpfully, the paper noted that the drug is associated with “sinister legends of murder, suicide and disaster.”</p>

<p>Use of the drug in Southern California began to pick up by the 1920s, and as it did, so too did the media and public officials’ exaggeration of its effects. One state judge claimed that “more men are seriously injured by persons under the influence of marihuana than from any two causes.” One article warned that the drug was “a shortcut to the lunatic asylum.” In 1923, a columnist for the San Francisco Examiner laid down this warning:</p>

<p>Hasheesh will turn the mildest man in the world into a blood-thirsty murderer. The man who takes hasheesh ‘runs amok’ with his bloody knife in one hand and his strangling cloth in the other, and he kills, kills, kills until the hasheesh has burnt out its deadly flame.</p>

<p>As Gieringer points out, the first marijuana arrest in San Francisco wouldn’t occur for another 5½ years.</p>

<p>The Progressive era brought the temperance movement, and with it, yet more hysteria about intoxicants of all kinds. California followed other state legislatures by stiffening its penalties for cannabis. A 1925 law prescribed the same penalty for possession as for sale. Either could bring up to six years in prison. Four years later, the state made a second offense for possession punishable by up to 10 years. And yet despite all the hype, Southern Californians were increasingly finding something to like about the drug. By 1932, three out of five narcotics arrests in Los Angeles were for cannabis. The number of arrests continued to grow throughout the decade, then picked up again after World War II.</p>

<p>One of the more infamous postwar arrests was that of Robert Mitchum, the film noir star probably best known for appearing in the original “Cape Fear.” Mitchum at the time was known to be a partier, a well-known marijuana smoker and a bit of a carouser. His arrest was significant because at the time marijuana was widely believed to be a low-society drug. Browse California headlines from the 1940s and 1950s, and you’ll find lots of marijuana arrests of blacks, people with Latino names, and — occasionally — working-class whites. The most prominent arrests to make headlines were of jazz musicians, particularly if they were found with white women. But Mitchum was a bona fide movie star. His arrest made headlines for months. It probably both broadened the drug’s appeal and sparked panic about its use outside of marginalized populations.</p>

<p>The bust happened in September 1948, after Mitchum, actress Lila Leeds, a real estate developer and a dancer were set to smoke some pot in a house rented by the real estate developer. Just as the party began, the police scratched at an outside door, pretending to be the developer’s dogs. When the dancer opened the door to let them in, the police rushed in, guns drawn.</p>

<p>The entire operation was a setup, likely with the cooperation of the real estate developer. It also involved some illegal surveillance. By the time the four arrived at the police station, the police had already tipped off members of the press, who were waiting for a glimpse of the star. One police officer claimed to have seen the marijuana cigarettes that Lila Leeds brought to the house while peering through a window. (That this was the less incriminating version of events is telling.) A Los Angeles Police Department sergeant told the Los Angeles Times that the bust was part of broader plan to “clean the dope and narcotics users out of Hollywood.”</p>

<p>Only Mitchum and Leeds were prosecuted. Mitchum served two months in jail and was later exonerated after the shady police tactics were exposed. His career recovered just fine. The same can’t be said for Leeds. She also served two months in jail. She later said it was during those two months that she started using heroin. (Even back then, state officials somehow thought they could eradicate drug use by arresting movie stars for pot, even as they couldn’t keep heroin out of the jails.)</p>

<p>Despite Mitchum’s reputation, Leeds got the brunt of the blame as the supplier. After she violated her parole, a state judge banished her from California for five years, essentially ending her career in movies. She tried to find work in New York, but state officials refused to grant her an entertainer’s license, citing her conviction. She tried to redeem herself by starring in “Reefer Madness” knockoffs such as “Wild Weed” (in which the brother of Leeds’s character catches her smoking pot, which for some reason drives him to suicide), and “She Shoulda Said No!,” an unintentionally hilarious bit of campy propaganda loosely based on the Mitchum episode. (You can watch it in its entirety below.)</p>

<p>Mitchum had the star power (and — let’s be honest — was probably of the correct gender) to survive a pot arrest. Leeds wasn’t so lucky. She never worked in movies again. She battled depression and addiction and had numerous run-ins with the law for years. She apparently eventually found religion. There are reports of her volunteering at soup kitchens and raising money for the Shriners. She died in 1999.</p>

<p>In 1954, the California legislature stiffened the pot penalties again, putting the penalty for first-offense possession at one to 10 years behind bars and a conviction for selling the drug at five to 15 years. A third offense could have brought a life sentence. Despite the stiffer sentencing laws, the breathless media reports and the campy propaganda, by the mid-1950s marijuana was hugely popular in California. According to Gieringer, the state saw 140 pot arrests in 1935. In 1960, that number topped 5,000.</p>

<p>By the mid-1970s, pot arrests were well into six figures. All of those bodies were overburdening the state’s courts, prisons and budgets, and lawmakers had no choice but to roll back the tough sentencing regimes. We’ll pick up there tomorrow.</p>

<h2 id="deadlyswattinghoaxesandthedangerousconditioningofcops">Deadly 'swatting' hoaxes and the dangerous conditioning of cops</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2018-01-03</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2018/01/04/deadly-swatting-hoaxes-and-the-dangerous-conditioning-of-cops/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Lisa Finch, surrounded by family members, reacts to the killing of her son Andrew Finch after he was shot by police in Wichita, Kan., after what police say was a “swatting” prank. (Bo Rader/The Wichita Eagle via Associated Press)</p>

<p>By now, most of you have probably seen this story:</p>

<p>Online gamers have said in multiple Twitter posts that the shooting of a man Thursday night by Wichita police was the result of a “swatting” prank involving two gamers.</p>

<p>Swatting is an internet prank where someone makes a call to a police department with a false story of an ongoing crime – often with killing or hostages involved – in an attempt to draw a large number of police officers to a particular address.</p>

<p>The prank has gained traction across the country with online gamers. Those who try to cause the swatting incident will use caller ID spoofing or other techniques to disguise their number as being local. Or they call local non-emergency numbers instead of 911, according to 911.gov. …</p>

<p>[Deputy Wichita Police Chief Troy] Livingston said the department received a call that someone had an argument with their mother, that the father had been shot in the head and the shooter was holding his mother, brother and sister hostage.</p>

<p>“That was the information we were working off of,” he said.</p>

<p>Officers went to the 1000 block of McCormick, preparing for a hostage situation and they “got into position,” he said.</p>

<p>“A male came to the front door,” Livingston said. “As he came to the front door, one of our officers discharged his weapon.”</p>

<p>That man was 28-year-old Andrew Finch. He was killed. He leaves behind two young children.</p>

<p>Finch was innocent and unarmed. Here’s some relevant commentary from defense attorney Scott Greenfield:</p>

<p>There’s body cam video of the shooting, but the cops were a good distance away from Finch and the video provides little insight. You can hear a cop yell “show your hands, walk this way.” To the cop, who knows why he’s taking charge, his commands make sense. To a good guy, who couldn’t possibly conceive of why a distant cop was yelling at him, it makes no sense.</p>

<p>There is a good chance he wasn’t sure they were yelling at him, and he was looking around to see who else they might be screaming at. The idea that police would command him to “show his hands,” not the clearest phrase to a good guy to begin with, must have seemed absurd. Why would a cop tell him to show his hands? He was in his home, with his family, having an ordinary evening.</p>

<p>Finch was unarmed. He didn’t have any object in his hand that might have been mistaken for a gun, even though there would have been nothing wrong, nothing even unusual, if he had. The cops saw no glint of steel. They weren’t open and exposed, but distant and protected. But the cops had it in their head that he was a killer, and so they saw his every move as a killer’s move.</p>

<p>In this case, the police, of course, had good reason to think Finch was dangerous. But he wasn’t. The police claim the officer fired when Finch reached for his waistband. But that wasn’t a reason to shoot him. Even if Finch had a gun in his waistband, it would have been understandable. There was a commotion outside. It would have been perfectly legal for him to do so. But he didn’t have a gun. Which means either the police are lying about Finch reaching for his waistband, they saw something that didn’t happen, Finch was struggling to figure out what to do with his hands in the midst of the confusion, or, simply, he was trying to pull up his pants. None of those things merits death.</p>

<p>The incident brings to mind the case of Daniel Shaver, the man killed by Mesa, Ariz., police in January 2016. In the terrifying, heartbreaking body-camera footage — among the worst I’ve ever seen — Shaver pleads for his life while crawling on the ground, struggling to comply with the confusing, often contradictory orders the police are barking at him. As Shaver crawls along, as instructed, his shorts begin to come down. He reaches down to pull them up. That act — that struggle to preserve some small bit of dignity — cost Shaver his life.</p>

<p>There, too, the police had good reason to suspect Shaver was dangerous. Someone had seen him point a gun out of a window. But like Finch, Shaver wasn’t a threat. Shaver worked in pest control. The gun was a pellet gun.</p>

<p>In a long and harrowing thread yesterday, Twitter user “Ziggy” described the fear and confusion one feels when clearly frightened police are shouting out conflicting commands. Ziggy was shopping for some hair conditioner while listening to headphones. Apparently, the shopkeeper had called in a report about shoplifting. At some point between the dispatcher and the responding officers, shoplifting turned into armed robbery.</p>

<p>“All I wanted to do was follow instructions. Last thing I wanted was some mild mistake to end my life,” Ziggy writes in one tweet. “What if I missed an instruction because of the K-Pop blaring in my ears? What if I reached for my ears and this rookie flinched?” he asks in another.</p>

<p>Ziggy survived the incident. Shaver and Finch didn’t. Neither did Ismael Lopez. He was shot and killed in his own home last July when Southaven, Miss., police served a domestic violence warrant at the wrong house. The police say he came to the door with a gun, which again, he’d have been legally permitted to do. An attorney for the family has since said that Lopez was shot in the back of the head, casting doubt on the police narrative. Whatever happened, Lopez was innocent.</p>

<p>Even taking the police narrative as fact in all of these stories, the outcomes emphasize the need for police officers — particularly those who respond to volatile situations — to be trained in de-escalation, to be screened for hotheads and to be trained to tame their own fear and anxiety. Because sometimes a rifle really is just a pellet gun. Sometimes a hostage situation is a prank. Sometimes a dispatcher gets it wrong. And sometimes a man “reaching for his waistband” is just trying to pull up his pants.</p>

<p>But these stories also show that what the police claim to have seen isn’t what happened. Here at The Watch, we’ve catalogued a litany of cases in which police claimed to have seen unarmed men reaching for their waistbands. No doubt some of them were, so that they could pull up their pants. Even if all of these suspects really did reach for their waistbands, the fact that so many were unarmed would seem to demand that police be trained to understand that reaching for one’s waistband does not necessarily mean one is reaching for a gun and that such an act, in and of itself, doesn’t merit lethal force. It would seem to demand that the courts emphasize this point as well.</p>

<p>Of course, there’s also the real possibility that in many of these cases, the shooting officer constructed a memory to justify the shooting. Sometimes this can be unintentional. We tend to remember our own actions in the best possible light, even to the point of creating false memories. But we’ve also seen cases where police actively conspired to create a false narrative after the fact.</p>

<p>It’s when police officers mistakenly harm their fellow officers that we really see the problems with law enforcement narratives. Last September, St. Louis police reportedly beat and arrested a fellow police officer who had gone undercover during a series of protests. The police claimed that their fellow officer, who was black, was resisting arrest. That seems implausible. By the time the officer is getting arrested, there would be little reason for him to resist to maintain his cover. He undoubtedly knew how the police operate. He undoubtedly knew that resisting would bring a beating and an arrest. That both happened anyway strongly suggests that the police account of the incident was false.</p>

<p>Last summer, also in St. Louis, a black off-duty police officer was shot by his fellow officers during a response to a reported car theft. Again, given that he is a cop himself, it seems unlikely that the officer would have done anything to provoke his colleagues. The officer’s attorney later said that because he was off-duty, the shooting officers simply treated his client “like an ordinary black guy.”</p>

<p>The city of Albuquerque recently paid more than $6 million to a police officer who was shot eight times by a fellow officer while working undercover during a drug sting. The shooting officer claimed that the undercover officer put him in fear of his life. This again seems unlikely. It’s hard to see why an undercover officer would do anything that might provoke a fellow officer to shoot him. He knows the department policy on lethal force. He’d foolishly be putting his life at risk.</p>

<p>Albuquerque has a long history of questionable police shootings. Its officers are taught at the state academy, which was recently put under the command of a law enforcement official who teaches a much more aggressive style of policing, thinks we live in “a more dangerous world” (we don’t) and says things such as “Evil has come to the state of New Mexico, evil has come to the Southwest, evil has come to the United States.”</p>

<p>The common denominator in these stories is that the police perceived a threat and used potentially lethal force against someone who we can safely say was innocent — someone who either had no gun, was wrongly suspected due to police error, or was himself a police officer. The police saw danger where there was none. We have scared the police into seeing threats that don’t exist, then given them near carte blanche to use lethal force whenever a threat is perceived. The threat needn’t be real. Only perceived. (This week, an officer from the same Wichita Police Department that killed Finch attempted to shoot at a dog inside a home. He mistakenly shot a 9-year-old girl instead. And just a couple of weeks ago, police in Texas opened fire on a woman suspected of stealing a car after mistaking a lead pipe for a gun. One bullet pierced a nearby home and killed a 6-year-old boy.)</p>

<p>We don’t live in a more dangerous world, and evil hasn’t come to the United States (or, I guess, it hasn’t come in any greater quantities than it always has). By early counts, last year was the second-safest year for police officers since 1959. Crime remains at near-historic lows. Yet there’s an ongoing belief in law enforcement that the police are constantly under attack. You see it in the exaggeration and hyping up of the threat of ambushes and targeted killings (both of which do occur, but are vanishingly infrequent when compared with the number of cops on the street). And you see it in the menacing movement within law enforcement that sees the world in apocalyptic hues and that urges police to shoot more people more often — to dispense with hesitation and critical thinking and rely more on primordial instinct and muscle memory.</p>

<p>This perception of a constant and growing danger isn’t just inconsistent with the data; it’s also dangerous. It puts lives at unnecessary risk. It increases the chances that a police officer will see an innocent gesture as a furtive one. It makes cops less likely to hesitate when an innocent homeowner confronts them after they mistakenly show up at the wrong residence. And it makes them more likely to see a desperate attempt to preserve some dignity as a last-ditch lunge for a gun.</p>

<h2 id="civillibertiespredictionsfor2018">Civil liberties predictions for 2018</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-28</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/12/29/civil-liberties-predictions-for-2018/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>The end of December is typically the time for year-end lists, best-of lists, and predictions for the year ahead. This post is the latter — it’s an indication of where I think civil liberties are headed in 2018.</p>

<p>These predictions are admittedly cynical — perhaps even a bit far-fetched or paranoid. But there’s some value in contemplating how bad things could get if we aren’t vigilant.</p>

<p>So, let’s get to it. Here are my predictions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Staying ever-alert in the war on drugs, Congress will attempt to ban drugs that don’t yet exist.</p></li>

<li><p>Taking police indemnity to new extremes, a federal appeals court will rule that a police officer who shoots into a car full of people cannot be sued because he didn’t actually hit anyone. On second thought, let’s make it even worse. Let’s call it a van, and let’s fill it with children.</p></li>

<li><p>The Pentagon’s 1033 program, which gives surplus military equipment to police agencies — has long been accused of giving inappropriate weapons and gear willy-nilly. Next year, the program will level up, and give weapons and gear to a policy agency that doesn’t exist.</p></li>

<li><p>Deputies caught lying on the witness stand will finally drop the charade and claim they were “unaware they were required to testify honestly.”</p></li>

<li><p>In response to complaints about keeping inmates in solitary confinement, the Bureau of Prisons will respond that this isn’t the case — not because inmates aren’t being held in isolation, but because the agency “does not recognize the term solitary confinement.” </p></li>

<li><p>The Jeff Sessions Justice Department will ignore the small mountain of evidence showing that municipal courts prey on the poor, and rescind an Obama-era opinion advising those courts to go easy on impoverished people charged with petty crimes.</p></li>

<li><p>The GOP Congress will introduce a bill making it nearly impossible to sue police officers, even in cases of egregious misconduct.</p></li>

<li><p>Not to be outdone, some state legislature will hit the poor even harder, passing a bill that essentially blocks state judges from giving poor defendants a break in especially difficult cases.</p></li>

<li><p>Hmm. What else can we do to poor people? Here’s an idea: Some government housing agency will invite local police to practice their drug searches on residents of a public housing complex.</p></li>

<li><p>Not enough? Let’s also predict that some judge will prohibit a low-income mom from seeing her newborn baby because of unpaid fines related to misdemeanors.</p></li>

<li><p>Ah, the hell with it. Let’s just predict that it will become a crime to feed the homeless.</p></li>

<li><p>A federal appeals court will continue to shield forensic misconduct from accountability, ruling that even when forensic experts engage in grossly negligent misconduct that sends an innocent person to prison — or even to death row — those experts can’t be sued by the people they harmed.</p></li>

<li><p>It’s hard to concoct a scenario of a police officer getting off for a shooting despite damning video evidence that’s worse than what we’ve already seen. But let’s give it a try: In the most open-and-shut video yet, body camera footage will show a police officer executing a clearly unarmed man, despite the footage showing the man to be fully complying with police instructions. For good measure, let’s say the video will also show the man pleading for his life, and begging the officer not to shoot him. The officer will shot the man anyway. And the officer will walk.</p></li>

<li><p>Despite the massive pile of evidence showing that bite mark evidence is unreliable and unscientific, a judge will once again allow it into evidence in a murder trial.</p></li>

<li><p>The federal government will try to make it a crime merely to be near someone who is rioting or looting during a protest. </p></li>

<li><p>Just to make things interesting: To prosecute this new crime, federal prosecutors will use footage shot by notorious right-wing propagandist James O’Keefe.</p></li>

<li><p>Rather than protect a suspect’s right to an attorney, a state supreme court will rule that when a suspect asked for a “lawyer, dog,” a reasonable person might have thought the suspect was asking for a Rottweiler with a law degree.</p></li>

<li><p>The Justice Department will make the Kafkaesque argument that people who have received illegally long sentences should not be allowed to challenge those sentences in court.</p></li>

<li><p>Again, not to be outdone, conservative state legislatures will pass laws aimed at criminalizing protest.</p></li>

<li><p>Okay, maybe that’s not outrageous enough. How about this: State legislatures will pass laws to indemnify people who run over protesters with their cars.</p></li>

<li><p>The drug war is always good for some new outrages. Here’s a prediction: Some crazy county sheriff will conduct a pat-down search of every single student of a local high school. For good measure, let’s say that some of the deputies will also grope and sexually assault some of the students. Oh, and let’s include this twist: Let’s say the sheriff’s son will also be arrested for drug possession. </p></li>

<li><p>Not outrageous enough? Fine. I’ll also predict we’ll learn that some police departments routinely catheterize drug suspects without those suspects’ consent. We’ll learn that some police agencies even do this to children. We’ll also see cops performing roadside searches of women’s vaginas.</p></li>

<li><p>As the death penalty wanes, its most ardent supporters will only grow more determined. I predict one state will try to execute five people in 10 days. No. Let’s make it worse. Let’s say eight people in 10 days.</p></li>

<li><p>The president of the United States will encourage police brutality. Just to make things interesting, let’s also have him do it while addressing a police agency that’s actually in the midst of a scandal about police brutality and coverup.</p></li>

<li><p>A police union official will actually attack the people who fight to exonerate the wrongly convicted as greedy, and say it’s ludicrous to think police would ever frame an innocent person. This will happen in the same city where there’s a history of police torturing innocent people until they confess, where the city actually incentivizes cops to wrongly arrest people for low-level crimes, and where, even as the union official made those comments, one cop stands accused of framing more than 50 people.</p></li>

<li><p>Some people will write to the White House to express concern that a new government program may expose their personal information. The White House will respond by publishing their personal information.</p></li>

<li><p>Somehow, a nationally-known sheriff who is good friends with the president will find a way to have taxpayers subsidize his legal defense — a perk regular people would never get.</p></li>

<li><p>In one of the states that relies on traffic fines to fund public defenders, prosecutors and cops will concoct a devious scheme: They’ll give motorists a discount if they write checks directly to DA’s offices, thus robbing public defenders of revenue.</p></li>

<li><p>Some state legislature will look at the story of an innocent man wrongly convicted, sentenced to death, and imprisoned for 30 years, and conclude that the lesson here is not that the system needs reform, or that the wrongly convicted should be compensated, but that they need to be executing people more quickly.</p></li>

<li><p>Police unions will up their game, begin urging supporters to harass businesses owned by people who criticize law enforcement.</p></li>

<li><p>Police unions will also counter charges of racial bias with some preposterous attempt to turn the tables. This prediction is a little out there, and I suspect I’ll feel silly about it later. But I predict some police union will suggest that criticism of the police is just as bad as racism. I predict they’ll even come up with a really dumb and offensive term for it. Let’s go with “blue racism.”</p></li>

<li><p>A prosecutor will bring charges against a mother because of crimes committed by her children.</p></li>

<li><p>A judge will rule than an innocent man who lost his spleen after he was shot during a botched drug raid has only himself to blame for his injuries. This is because when the police broke in and woke him, the startled, completely innocent man made a slight gesture in the direction of the raiding officers.</p></li>

<li><p>The problem with how the Justice Department handles police officers accused of crimes isn’t that the officers are treated fairly and humanely, it’s that few others get the same sort of treatment. Let’s make a prediction that takes this to some crazy extreme: A police officer charged with murder for shooting a 6-year-old will somehow be able to take a vacation to the Virgin Islands while awaiting trial.</p></li>

<li><p>A police officer will violently tackle an innocent man after mistaking him for a robbery suspect, then sue the innocent man he tackled for complaining.</p></li>

<li><p>Let’s take that concept a step farther: Another cop will shoot and kill a teenager, and also mistakenly shoot and kill a neighbor of that teenager. The cop will then sue the dead teenager’s family for emotional distress.</p></li>

<li><p>A district attorney in a large city will issue a bunch of fake subpoenas . . . and then claim there’s nothing wrong with sending fake subpoenas.</p></li>

<li><p>A sheriff will rail against criminal justice reform because he needs inmates around to wash his car.</p></li>

<li><p>Playing to stereotype, New York City will tackle the urgent problems of . . . hmm . . . what’s the most ridiculous thing the city could crack down on? I’ll go with unlicensed dog sitters and delivery guys who use electric bikes.</p></li>

<li><p>Police responding to a protest will mistakenly arrest one of their own undercover cops. They will then claim that their colleague had it coming because he was resisting.</p></li>

<li><p>A cop will unjustly shoot an unarmed man, then suffer a panic attack. The unarmed man will then be arrested on the theory that by getting shot, he induced the cop’s panic attack.</p></li>

<li><p>A state legislature will vote to allow guns into a government building, but will ban signs held by protesters, declaring them a “serious safety hazard.”</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You’ve all probably figured it out by now, but these aren’t predictions at all. These are all stories that took place in 2017. So. Happy New Year!</p>

<p>The Watch will be back on Tuesday, prepped for another year of madness.</p>

<p>President Trump sits with Attorney General Jeff Sessions during the FBI National Academy graduation ceremony this month in Quantico. There were a number of notable Trump- or Sessions-related blog posts at The Watch this year. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)</p>

<p>It was an odd year to be on the criminal-justice beat. As promised, the Trump administration set about dismantling whatever progress we were making toward criminal-justice reform at the federal level (why do politicians only keep their bad promises?) and continued to spread misinformation about how often crimes occur and who commits them. Of course, President Trump was also making a ton of news outside the world of criminal justice, so much so that important stories at the state and local level were often buried.</p>

<p>Our biggest story here at The Watch was a months-long investigation into Hugo Holland, a notoriously aggressive Louisiana prosecutor who has been repeatedly accused of withholding exculpatory evidence and was fired several years ago for falsifying federal forms. But pay records show that Holland was subsequently hired by parishes all over the state, mostly to handle death penalty cases. Within a few years, he had doubled the salary he had been making at the time of his firing. He has also been hired to teach classes at orientations and conferences for new prosecutors, as well as to lobby the state legislature to vote against bills aimed at criminal-justice reform.</p>

<p>Speaking of Louisiana, The Watch also reported that the state Supreme Court justice who briefly earned national attention for his “lawyer dog” opinion has also made some controversial and prejudicial comments about pending cases on talk radio. We also eulogized two champions of justice in Louisiana: the longtime criminal defense attorney Sam Dalton, and John Thompson, the fiery activist who was twice convicted — and nearly executed — for crimes he did not commit.</p>

<p>Content from Optum</p>

<p>“I see reasons to believe our health system can solve this crisis.” - David Calabrese, Chief Pharmacy Officer, Optum Rx </p>

<p>It wasn’t all Louisiana. We continued to follow the story of Robert and Addie Harte, the Kansas couple wrongly raided by a SWAT team because of a trip to a gardening store and some loose-leaf tea. After the federal courts whittled their lawsuit down to a single, nearly-impossible-to-prove claim, the Hartes lost in front of a federal jury this month.</p>

<p>As for the Trump administration, we kept tabs on the White House’s and Justice Department’s record on civil liberties and criminal justice with the ongoing “Trump Watch” and will continue to do so. Other notable Trump- or Jeff Sessions-related posts from 2017:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Jeff Sessions supports states’ rights, except when he doesn’t: A critique of Sessions’s fair-weather federalism. He supports “states’ rights” when it comes to, say, voting laws or restricting gay rights, or not investigating police abuses. But not when it comes to decriminalizing or legalizing marijuana, allowing undocumented immigrants to live in peace or letting states make their own laws about civil asset forfeiture without federal interference.</p></li>

<li><p>Trump, policing and the teenage brain: Trump’s ego and lack of impulse control may have a lot to do with his views on law enforcement.</p></li>

<li><p>Sessions dismisses Justice Department reports on police abuse without bothering to read them.</p></li>

<li><p>Trump’s presidential address in late February was a broadside attack on the values of a free society.</p></li>

<li><p>Consent decrees have a mixed record of success, but Sessions’s plan to end them is still worrisome.</p></li>

<li><p>Deputy attorney general announces new Forensic Science Working Group but still doesn’t grasp the extent of the problem: The Justice Department will address forensics reform internally. There’s little reason to think the department will get it right.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of forensics, there were lots of other interesting stories on that beat.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There were new developments in the ongoing saga of disgraced Mississippi forensic specialists Steven Hayne and Michael West: In August, Hayne backed off his “shaken baby” theory during a hearing for death row inmate Jeffrey Havard. A judge is expected to rule soon on whether Havard will get a new trial. Unfortunately, despite a 5th Circuit determination a few years ago that Hayne is not a credible witness, the courts continued to rule against the people harmed. In February, the same court ruled against a man convicted mostly due to absurd testimony Hayne gave after creating a “death mask” of an alleged victim. And in June, a 5th Circuit panel ruled that Hayne and West were protected by qualified immunity in dismissing a lawsuit brought by exonerees Kennedy Brewer and Levon Brooks. A three-judge panel found that while the two experts may have been grossly negligent, Brooks and Brewer had to show they acted recklessly, and had failed to do so. Finally, in May we asked what Mississippi owes to a 13-year-old who was convicted in part due to some particularly absurd testimony from Hayne.</p></li>

<li><p>However, a couple of months later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit did allow a lawsuit to proceed against two bite-mark analysts who helped convict Robert Lee Stinson. The court found that Stinson had presented enough evidence for a jury to reasonably find a criminal conspiracy to manufacture evidence. Incredibly, the Wisconsin appeals court decision allowing bite-mark evidence against Stinson is still the controlling case law on bite-mark analysis in that state.</p></li>

<li><p>At the same time, another man convicted because of bite-mark evidence was exonerated and released from prison. He served 19 years. And earlier in the year, another man wrongly convicted confronted the bite-mark analysts who put him in prison.</p></li>

<li><p>And yet despite all of that, and despite a mountain of evidence showing bite-mark analysis to be dubious, prosecutors continue to defend bite-mark analysis, and this year yet another judge allowed it into evidence during a criminal trial.</p></li>

<li><p>Robert O’Block, the king of junk forensics, died over the summer. We took a look back at his odd and unfortunate career.</p></li>

<li><p>Judges continued to do a pretty terrible job at keeping bad science out of criminal trials.</p></li>

<li><p>These issues briefly hit the pop culture, as John Oliver delivered a righteous and at times humorous monologue about forensics in the courtroom.</p></li>

<li><p>Of course, Trump didn’t take office until late January. So during the first part of the month, we criticized Barack Obama for his own failures on forensics reform — and for exaggerating his record on that issue.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We also continued to track the criminalization of poverty, mostly by pointing to terrific reporting and investigations done by other media outlets. Some of the more notable stories:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some anonymous North Carolina lawmakers just made it harder to be poor.</p></li>

<li><p>Hey, Sheriff Grady Judd: Here are the reasons not to lock up people with outstanding warrants who come to hurricane shelters.</p></li>

<li><p>The ongoing criminalization of parenting while poor.</p></li>

<li><p>Colorado housing officials invite cops to perform warrantless searches on poor people.</p></li>

<li><p>Mississippi judge resigns after barring mother from seeing newborn because of unpaid court fees.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are a few of my other favorite posts from the past year:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How the National Rifle Association’s allegiance to cops undermines its credibility on gun rights.</p></li>

<li><p>How public-choice theory can be an important tool for understanding the criminal-justice system.</p></li>

<li><p>Steven Seagal: Drug warrior, honorary cop, alleged serial sex abuser</p></li>

<li><p>Another narcotics task force is in the midst of a corruption and brutality scandal. This is nothing new.</p></li>

<li><p>South Carolina police shot a man to pieces over $100 worth of pot, then lied about it.</p></li>

<li><p>The Supreme Court heard an important case involving the “provocation doctrine,” which holds that if police violate a suspect’s rights in a way that escalates a confrontation, they can be held accountable even if the ultimate use of lethal force was justified. The court then ruled the wrong way.</p></li>

<li><p>Forced catheterizations are a good reminder that the drug war is as barbaric and cruel as ever.</p></li>

<li><p>The debacle in Arkansas only reaffirms that the death penalty is arbitrary, unchecked and unfair.</p></li>

<li><p>Police groups want to bar the public from seeing controversial body-camera footage — and lawmakers are obliging them.</p></li>

<li><p>We should treat Confederate monuments the way Moscow and Budapest have treated communist statues.</p></li>

<li><p>The damning Justice Department report about Chicago police also helps explain the city’s murder rate.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks for reading, as well as for your comments, leads and story ideas. I’ll be back after the Christmas holiday.</p>

<h2 id="juryrulesagainstfamilysubjectedtoswatraidoverlooseleaftea">Jury rules against family subjected to SWAT raid over loose-leaf tea</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-18</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/12/19/jury-rules-against-family-subjected-to-swat-raid-over-loose-leaf-tea/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Loose-leaf tea. (Bigstock)</p>

<p>If you’ve been reading The Watch for a while, you know about the Harte family and how they were subjected to a SWAT raid on their home because (a) Robert Harte and his son shopped at a hydroponic gardening store to obtain supplies for a school project, and (b) Addie Harte drinks loose-leaf tea, which police (and drug field tests) somehow mistook for marijuana. The Hartes were completely innocent. The police messed up.</p>

<p>The Hartes then spent a small fortune navigating Kansas’s notoriously opaque open-records laws just to learn why they were raided in the first place. Once they had that information, they could finally move ahead with their lawsuit.</p>

<p>Last July, more than five years after the raid, a federal appeals court allowed their lawsuit to go forward. But as I pointed out here at The Watch at the time, thanks to the doctrine of qualified immunity, the family’s suit survived only on a single claim, and it would be an extremely difficult one to win — the Hartes would have to show that the police officers lied about the tea “evidence” to obtain the search warrant.</p>

<p>On all the other claims — the fact that the cops were unaware that field tests are notoriously unreliable and should never be relied upon as probable cause for a raid, that the cops relied on their experience and expertise to obtain the search warrant despite mistaking tea for marijuana, that local police officials had hyped up the series of raids that included the raid on the Hartes’s home as a 4/20 operation (they scheduled a news conference the same day in anticipation of their success), the lack of surveillance or corroborating investigation of the Hartes, the heavy-handed tactics despite the relatively dubious evidence, the fact that there were children in the home — on all of this, the federal appeals court found that because the police were protected by qualified immunity, the Hartes would have to show that not only were their rights violated but also that the police should have known that under clearly established law, their actions were violations of the Hartes’s rights. By a 2-1 margin, the panel of judges ruled that the Hartes had failed to do so.</p>

<p>That left only the claim that police lied to obtain the search warrant. Short of a recording of someone openly admitting to lying, this is a nearly impossible thing to prove. It isn’t enough even to show that the officers should have known that the substance they found in the family’s trash wasn’t marijuana. The Hartes had to show that they did know, then claimed to a judge that the tea was pot, anyway.</p>

<p>When the 10th Circuit panel allowed the lawsuit to go forward, there was some celebration that this was a victory for the Fourth Amendment. I pointed out at the time that it really wasn’t. This family was subjected to a violent, terrifying raid due to police incompetence, negligence and neglect. Yet in order to see a dime in damages, they’d have to prove something that’s nearly impossible. Even if they somehow won, the police officers themselves would be indemnified, removing any real deterrent to prevent this sort of thing from happening again.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the Hartes lost in court last week.</p>

<p>A Leawood couple who were mistakenly targeted in a 2012 police drug raid have lost their lawsuit against Johnson County.</p>

<p>A federal court jury late Tuesday afternoon found that Adlynn and Robert Harte were not entitled to any monetary damages as a result of the raid by deputies with the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office.</p>

<p>The Hartes can take comfort in at least one victory. They persuaded the state legislature to make police records like those associated with the Hartes’s case somewhat easier to obtain. But in the end, no one was punished for the raid on the Harte home. Not the cops who botched the investigation. Not the cops who conducted the raid. Not the supervising law enforcement officials who encouraged shortcuts with their 4/20 stunt.</p>

<p>Worse, they seem to have learned nothing from it.</p>

<p>An attorney for the sheriff’s office also released a written statement.</p>

<p>“On behalf of the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office and the deputies we thank the jury for their service,” said Lawrence Ferree. “The Hartes had their day in court. The system worked.“</p>

<p>Emphasis added, because that phrase is important. Remember, no one disputes that the Hartes are innocent of any criminal wrongdoing. No one disputes that the officers conducted a raid on their home after mistaking tea for marijuana. And no one disputes that the officers improperly used the results of notoriously unreliable field tests as probable cause for the mistaken raid, instead of sending the tea to a lab for more rigorous testing.</p>

<p>No one disputes any of these things. Yet the system failed to compensate the Hartes for what happened to them, and the system failed to hold any of the law enforcement officers accountable for their mistakes.</p>

<p>So I actually agree with the attorney for the sheriff’s office. When its own actors are accused of wrongdoing, the justice system has been designed not to dispense justice, but to put a priority on protecting police, public officials and government entities from accountability.</p>

<p>So, yes. The system did work. It did just what it was designed to do. And that makes these stories all the more worrying.</p>

<h2 id="crimekillingsofpolicebothdownin2017">Crime, killings of police both down in 2017</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-19</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/12/20/crime-police-killings-both-down-in-2017/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions speaks to members of the Indianapolis Ten Point Coalition on Nov. 6. (Darron Cummings/AP)</p>

<p>All measures of crime in the 30 largest American cities — the overall crime rate, violent crime rate, and murder rate — are estimated to decline in 2017 according to a year-end analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.</p>

<p>Crime in 2017: Updated Analysis directly undercuts any claims of a nationwide crime wave.</p>

<p>Key findings from the analysis include:</p>

<p>• The overall crime rate in the 30 largest cities in 2017 is estimated to decline slightly from [2016], falling by 2.7 percent.</p>

<p>• The violent crime rate will also decrease slightly, by 1.1 percent, essentially remaining stable.</p>

<p>• The 2017 murder rate in the 30 largest cities is estimated to decline by 5.6 percent. Large decreases this year in Chicago [down 11.9 percent] and Detroit [down 9.8 percent], as well as small decreases in other cities, contributed to this decline. … New York City’s murder rate will also decline again, to 3.3 killings per 100,000 people.</p>

<p>There are of course a few cities where violent crime was up last year, including Charlotte and Baltimore. That’s true most years. But this year’s crime stats do suggest that the two-year uptick in violent crime was more of a blip than a trend. And they definitely obliterate the line pushed by the Trump administration and law-and-order types that we’re in the midst of some massive crime wave, or, as Attorney General Sessions is fond of proclaiming, that we’re seeing the largest increase in crime in decades. (This was true last year only if you go by percentage increases in the crime rate, and ignore the low baseline created by the 20-year dramatic drop in crime.)</p>

<p>The other line we’ve heard in the last couple years from law-and-order officials is that there’s a “war on cops,” driven they say by police criticism and groups like Black Lives Matter. Here too, proponents of the line pointed to a two-year, not-insignificant rise in the number of intentional killings of police officers. But here too, the increase came only after a two-decade drop, and here too, it appears to have been short-lived. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 43 police officers were killed by gunfire so far this year, down 34 percent from this time last year. Last year’s figure was a five-year high, but still below the average over the last 10 years, a good sign that this figure is moving in the right direction.</p>

<p>This is all very good news. The question now is if Trump and Sessions will continue to lie about the crime rate in America, or now that they’ve been in office for a year, if they’ll try to take credit for it.</p>

<h2 id="itstimetoabolishthecoroner">It's time to abolish the coroner</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-11</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/12/12/its-time-to-abolish-the-coroner/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Two San Joaquin County, Calif., medical examiners have resigned in the past two weeks, alleging that Sheriff-Coroner Steve Moore pressured them to change their autopsy results for deaths in police custody. In other instances also involving deaths at the hands of police, they say, the sheriff ignored their conclusions completely.</p>

<p>Bennet Omalu, the chief medical examiner for the county, tendered his resignation on Nov. 28, as did a colleague, Susan Parson. (Notable aside: Omalu is the medical examiner who exposed the degenerative brain condition found in many former NFL players and was the inspiration for the movie “Concussion.”) Omalu was hired in 2007 to help professionalize and modernize the county medical examiner’s office. In his resignation letter, he said that Moore “has always made calculated attempts to control me as a physician and influence my professional judgement.”</p>

<p>Following her resignation last week, Parson sent copies of emails, notes and other correspondence to the San Joaquin County district attorney and the board of supervisors to support both doctors’ claims.</p>

<p>The documents, obtained by KQED, included memos written by Omalu that raised serious questions about the integrity of investigations of people who died in the custody of law enforcement officers who used Tasers or other types of force.</p>

<p>Omalu wrote that the sheriff’s interference in death investigations had “gotten even worse” over the last two years . . .</p>

<p>In March 2017, Omalu and Parson began documenting incidents they believe show wrongdoing by Sheriff Moore. The two doctors allege the sheriff labeled certain deaths as “accidents” rather than “homicides” to shield from prosecution law enforcement officers who were involved.</p>

<p>In the Aug. 22, 2017, memo, one of several he drafted over the past nine months to document his concerns, Omalu wrote: “The Sheriff does whatever he feels like doing as the coroner, in total disregard of bioethics, standards of practice of medicine and the generally accepted principles of medicine.”</p>

<p>Among the specific incidents the two doctors cite:</p>

<p>— Omalu cited the case of Daniel Humphreys, a father of two who died on a Stockton freeway median in 2008 after crashing his motorcycle as he fled arrest.</p>

<p>In a deposition for a lawsuit brought by Humphreys’ family, Omalu said he was told by investigators that a California Highway Patrol officer had used a Taser on Humphreys once or twice. But when Omalu asked to see a computer record that the weapon automatically generates when fired, he was told there was no report to see. In his autopsy report, Omalu attributed Humphreys’ death to a head injury from the accident . . . Two years later, a deputy district attorney shared the Taser report with Omalu. It showed that the CHP officer in fact fired the Taser at Humphreys 31 times. A source close to the sheriff’s office said that the sheriff had access to the Taser report since the day after Humphreys’ death.</p>

<p>— One case involved Abelino Cordova-Cuevas, 28, who died in a March 7, 2016, confrontation with Stockton police.</p>

<p>Police told The Stockton Record that officers used a stun gun to subdue Cordova-Cuevas. An attorney representing the family alleged the officers used an illegal chokehold.</p>

<p>Omalu found that the man had died from asphyxiation and blunt force trauma and that his death was a homicide; the sheriff certified the manner of death an accident.</p>

<p>— The autopsy of Samuel Augustine Jr. concluded that he died June 7, 2016, of a traumatic brain injury and a spinal cord injury during arrest by Stockton police — and that the manner of death was homicide. Omalu wrote that the sheriff told him that his findings were wrong and should be changed.</p>

<p>“This is simply daylight corruption and nothing else,” Omalu wrote in a memo dated the day after he alleges the sheriff approached him. “He is using his office and powers to protect police officers.”</p>

<p>Omalu came to the conclusion that Sheriff Moore “seems to believe that every officer-involved death should be ruled an accident because the police did not mean to kill anyone.”</p>

<p>Omalu and Parsons are both board-certified forensic pathologists. Moore is not. So why can Moore overrule these two doctors on whether a death was an accident or a homicide?</p>

<p>As it turns out, this is a fun little artifact of the coroner system, which the United States inherited from Britain. Coroners are often confused with medical examiners, but they are two very different positions, and they rarely overlap. A medical examiner is a doctor who performs autopsies after suspicious deaths. The county coroner is an elected position. In most states, you don’t need any medical training, police training or crime investigation training to run for the office. There are only a few states where the coroner must be a physician, and even in those states there’s a big loophole — if no doctor wants the office, anyone can run for it.</p>

<p>Back in medieval England, the office of “coroner” originally had nothing to do with death. The coroner’s responsibility for investigating suspicious deaths came about almost by accident. The background on how all of that happened is pretty fascinating, but a bit too involved to get into here. (You can read all about it in my forthcoming book, “The Cadaver King and the Country Dentist.”) The office of coroner was essentially a catch-all position for the crown, but that didn’t neatly fit under any other office (“coroner” comes from “crowner,” or an agent of the crown). You can still see vestiges of the coroner’s utility function in the United States. In some states, the county coroner is responsible for auctioning off unclaimed property. In others, he or she is the only public official with the power to arrest the county sheriff. Until the 1990s, coroners in Mississippi had two responsibilities: investigate suspicious deaths, and round up any stray livestock and return it to its rightful owner. A call in the middle of the night could have been to investigate a murder, or it could have been to catch some pigs.</p>

<p>In much of the country, the office of coroner is part time and low paying. It’s sometimes an entryway into politics, but more often it’s held by the local funeral home director. It’s a popular position for people in the mortuary industry, not because embalming bodies confers any relevant skills to investigating deaths, but because being the first at the scene of the death usually gives them first crack at selling funeral and body transport services to the families of the deceased.</p>

<p>By the early 20th century, the office of coroner grew to be quite powerful, particularly in large cities. It also had a reputation for corruption. A coroner’s determination about cause of death could determine whether or how much a life insurance company had to pay out. It could swing the outcome of a lawsuit in a factory death or negligence case. A bribed coroner could also help a rich or powerful family avoid public embarrassment when a relative committed suicide. Coroners could paper over mob hits, or exonerate a parent of child abuse. (If you’re interested in all of this, I highly recommend the book Death Investigation in America: Coroners, Medical Examiners, and the Pursuit of Medical Certainty, by Jeffrey Jentzen.)</p>

<p>For much of the past century, coroners played a shameful but often unnoticed role in facilitating lynchings, assassinations and other racial violence. Too often, coroners’ juries determined an obvious lynching to be a suicide or natural death. Even in cases in which they did determine a death to be homicide, they made little to no effort to ascertain the identities of the culprits, as they did in other cases.</p>

<p>As far back as the Progressive Era, groups such as the American Medical Association, the Municipal League and other civic and professional organizations have tried to get states to ditch the coroners for a more modern death investigation system. The coroners proved to be a political powerful lobby and were able to consistently push back reform efforts until the last 20 years or so of the 20th century. A few states did eventually abolish the coroner position, but many didn’t. Most that tried any reform at all ended up creating some sort of hybrid system in which a medical examiner performs the autopsies, but an elected coroner still has final say over manner of death. That often made things worse.</p>

<p>Allowing the official in charge of death investigations to be beholden to political forces is a bad idea, for lots of reasons. There are the obvious ones, like those already mentioned — coroners could be susceptible to influence by powerful interests that may have a stake in the outcome of a death investigation. As the story that kicked off this post illustrates, you also want the person in charge of determining cause and manner of death to be as insulated as possible from pressure by law enforcement officials. Deaths in police custody are the obvious concern here, but we’ve also seen examples where law enforcement pressure resulted in a homicide determination in cases where a child may have died accidentally, such as with shaken baby syndrome. The reverse can be a problem — sometimes, a sheriff or prosecutor may not want to deal with another unsolved murder and might pressure a coroner to rule an obvious homicide to be an accident, a suicide or a natural death. While this obviously isn’t the norm, it isn’t unheard of, and it tends to happen most often when the deceased is part of a marginalized community — where the death isn’t deemed “important.”</p>

<p>To some extent, a prosecutor or police chief unhappy with a cause of death determination will always be able to apply some pressure, no matter who is doing the determining. (See John Edland, the heroic medical examiner who autopsied the bodies after the Attica prison uprising.) But a medical examiner appointed by an official outside of law enforcement will be less susceptible than a low-level elected official.</p>

<p>Medical examiners are also often the first to notice outbreaks of communicable diseases. They can be the first to notice patterns of deaths from environmental toxins, or trends in fatalities that come with the adoption of new technologies (Tasers, for example). Here, too, it seems wise to keep them insulated from political pressure.</p>

<p>So let’s go back to California. In 41 of that state’e 58 counties, the coroner’s duties are automatically assumed by the elected sheriff. (That’s according to the California Association of Counties. According to the KQED article, it’s 50 of 58 counties. The discrepancy is probably due to the fact that each county can set its own policies about the degree to which the sheriff oversees or takes over the coroner duties.)</p>

<p>This seems like the worst of all worlds. It’s bad enough to have police agencies investigating their own officers after an officer-involved shooting. It’s quite a bit worse to then give the sheriff the final say over whether a death in police custody was natural, accidental, or intentional. Because once a death is determined to be accidental or natural, there is no investigation.</p>

<p>Interestingly, several California counties where the sheriff also serves as coroner consistently rank among the highest in the country when it comes to the rate of deaths at the hands of police. That includes Kern County, which in 2015 was profiled by the Guardian as the county with the most police killings per capita in the United States. Ditto for San Bernardino County, which in 2015 ranked third. In Orange County, where the sheriff’s department is currently mired in a scandal of epic proportions, that same sheriff’s office has ultimate say over any suspicious deaths involving its own deputies. Riverside and Contra Costa counties also have some of the highest rates of police killings in the country, and each also has elected sheriffs who double as coroner.</p>

<p>Oddly, this all seems to be a relatively recent development. In Riverside, for example, the sheriff began overseeing coroner investigations in 1999. In San Bernardino, it was in 2005. In Marin County, two offices merged in 2011. Most of these mergers appear to have occurred for budgetary reasons, but it’s telling that few local officials apparently saw much problem with giving an elected sheriff the final say over what ought to be a medical determination.</p>

<p>This, from the KQED article, is telling:</p>

<p>Last year, California lawmakers increased the independence of the forensic pathologists working for a sheriff-coroner by defining autopsies as a medical procedure that may be performed only by a licensed physician and surgeon.</p>

<p>A key provision of Sen. Richard Pan’s bill, SB 1189, would have given forensic pathologists the authority to determine both cause and manner of death. However, it was opposed by the California State Sheriffs’ Association and the California State Coroners Association, and taken out. The final version of the bill, which took effect Jan. 1, 2017, upheld the sheriff-coroner’s authority to decide the manner in which people died, but added a requirement to do so “in consultation with” the forensic pathologist who performs the autopsy.</p>

<p>The solution here is pretty simple. It’s the same solution that groups such as the AMA have been recommending since the late 1800s: States need to abolish the coroner system entirely, and move to a medical examiner system.</p>

<p>To be sure, the states and cities that have adopted a medical examiner system aren’t without their problems. Two big ones: There are far too few certified medical examiners for the number of autopsies that need to be done, and there isn’t enough separation between medical examiners and law enforcement. But these problems, while important, aren’t endemic to the medical examiner systems. With some political will, they could be fixed, or at least improved.</p>

<p>The problems with the coroner system are more fundamental. The very act of electing someone to determine manner of death suggests that there’s room for political factors to guide or influence that determination. That shouldn’t be something we encourage. Put another way, we shouldn’t encourage the idea that there might be a Democratic or Republican way to determine whether someone died accidentally, committed suicide or was murdered.</p>

<p>Instead, let’s let each group of professionals do what they’re trained to do. Let medical examiners determine the cause of death. In cases in which a forensic pathologist has determined a death to be a homicide, let the police then investigate. If there was indeed a crime, let officials look for a suspect. If a suspect is arrested, let prosecutors determine the appropriate charges. Of course, we do elect sheriffs and prosecutors. Whether that’s a good idea is another debate. But it’s hard to see what good comes from adding another elected office to all of that — one that requires little to no specialized training.</p>

<p>The coroner system isn’t just an anachronism; it’s an anachronism that never made much sense in the first place. It’s well past time to get rid of it.</p>

<h2 id="studyfindsherointrademistrustofpolicemostlikelycausesofsurgeinbigcityhomicides">Study finds heroin trade, mistrust of police most likely causes of surge in big-city homicides</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/12/07/study-finds-heroin-trade-mistrust-of-police-most-likely-causes-of-surge-in-big-city-homicides/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Here at The Watch, we’ve pointed out a couple of times the interesting overlap between police abuse and violent crime. In many of the same cities where we’ve seen a surge in homicides over the past few years — such as Baltimore, Cleveland, Chicago and the St. Louis area — we’ve also see compelling evidence of widespread police harassment, bias, abuse and corruption. In Baltimore, for example, headlines about police corruption compete with headlines about the latest homicide.</p>

<p>This lends at least some anecdotal support to what we might call the alternative Ferguson effect — the idea that when police are seen as abusive, corrupt and antagonistic, they’re less trusted by the communities they serve. There is less cooperation between police and citizens. And perhaps more importantly, when people don’t trust the police to resolve disputes, they tend to take matters into their own hands.</p>

<p>Now, a new study by the National Institute for Justice has found some empirical heft to support this theory.</p>

<p>Much speculation, but little empirical research, exists regarding the mechanisms linking police legitimacy, as reflected in public attitudes and perceptions, to crime rates. One study found a relationship between Google searches for phrases related to police violence (e.g., Black Lives Matter, police shootings, police brutality) and increases in monthly violent and homicide rates in U.S. cities between July 2014 and June 2016 (Gross and Mann 2017). Although this is the first study to document variation across cities in public concern with police use of force after Ferguson, it does not specify how that concern provoked increased violence.</p>

<p>This jibes with polling showing that whites (who have lower homicide rates) have a lot more trust in police than do blacks (who have higher homicide rates). The Atlantic reported on such polling last year.</p>

<p>Only a third of blacks say police do an “excellent or good job” in treating racial or ethnic groups equally, compared with three quarters of whites. Just under a quarter of blacks say the local police does “only a fair job” and about forty percent say they “do a poor job.”</p>

<p>And it’s not just the initial incidents; blacks report a lack of confidence in the ability of law-enforcement agencies to police themselves. Only a third of blacks in the Pew report say police are doing a good or excellent job in “holding officers accountable when misconduct occurs.” But 70 percent of whites say the same. This lack of confidence seems to be exacerbating the historical mistrust experienced by black residents. About 80 percent of respondents in the Pew report believe “these deaths signal a larger problem between police and the black community.” Just 54 percent of whites and 66 percent of Latinos say the same.</p>

<p>Neither of the studies links this lack of confidence to upticks in crime in the areas in which it’s concentrated. But they do suggest that well-publicized incidents are reinforcing historic distrust, and that this deters citizens from contacting police to report crimes. And given the reliance of police on their relationship with local communities, they raise the possibility that the problem in cities grappling with rising crime may be less that officers subjected to scrutiny are backing off from proactive policing, than that communities subjected to repeated abuses are losing faith in those who are sworn to protect them.</p>

<p>The new NIJ study notes another study that looked at the rate at which residents of Milwaukee called police for help after a high-profile incident of police abuse. As the authors point out, this probably is a better indicator of public trust in police than a pollster simply asking, “Do you trust police?”</p>

<p>Desmond et al. (2016) found that calls for police service dropped significantly after the police beat and badly injured an unarmed black man in Milwaukee; the decline was especially large in predominantly black neighborhoods. Their study also produced some evidence that widely publicized violent encounters between police and African-Americans elsewhere in the nation also reduced calls for service in Milwaukee. The researchers concluded that the decrease in calls for police service undermined public safety. In line with this interpretation, they reported that homicides, which are not likely to be affected by a reduction in calls for service, rose sharply after the police beating in Milwaukee.</p>

<p>One advantage of the Desmond et al. (2016) study of the social response to perceived police misconduct is its reliance on behavioral indicators rather than opinion surveys (or internet searches) to measure police-community relations. … “When it comes to relying on and cooperating with the police, what one does might not resemble what one says one will do. … People’s attitudes toward the criminal justice system might be poor, even misleading, indicators of their real-life dealings with the police.”</p>

<p>Of course, it’s likely that there’s more than one cause for the surge in homicides in many big cities. So the study also looks at some other possibilities. One likely culprit is the rising demand for heroin and other opioids, which likely caused a shift in black markets and, as a result, the violence that comes with turf wars. This makes some sense. We also saw a major surge in violent crime in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the popularity of crack cocaine disrupted the established black markets.</p>

<p>The study’s authors also look at “de-policing,” more commonly known as the Ferguson effect. This is the idea that protests, viral cellphone videos and general public criticism of police has made officers less likely to engage with citizens, which results in higher rates of violent crime. There is definitely evidence that police have become less proactive and that they are making fewer arrests. There’s also evidence that de-policing is more pronounced in nonwhite communities. But the new NIJ study findslittle correlation between arrest rates and homicide rates. From the study:</p>

<p>In summary, the UCR arrest data for large cities provide ambiguous support, at best, for the de-policing version of the Ferguson effect. Arrests for both serious and minor offenses decreased in 2015 when homicides were increasing, but they also fell several years earlier, when homicides were decreasing.</p>

<p>Frankly, if de-policing means fewer arrests for petty crimes such as disorderly conduct and drug possession, with no discernible overall effect on public safety, maybe that’s a good thing. The study also finds that the rate at which police in big cities are closing homicide cases is falling. That is, the cops are solving a smaller percentage of murders. Perhaps less police harassment over the little stuff — which also means less opportunity for escalation and conflict — will result in more cooperation and trust in police when there are serious crimes that need to be solved.</p>

<h2 id="walterscottskillerisgoingtoprisonbuthiscaseisananomaly">Walter Scott's killer is going to prison. But his case is an anomaly.</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-07</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/12/08/walter-scotts-killer-is-going-to-prison-but-his-case-is-an-anomaly/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>Former North Charleston police officer Michael Slager testifies last year during his murder trial at the Charleston County court in Charleston, S.C. (Grace Beahm/Post and Courier via Associated Press/Pool)</p>

<p>Michael Slager, the North Charleston, S.C., police officer who shot and killed black motorist Walter Scott, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday. He had earlier pleaded guilty to violating Scott’s civil rights.</p>

<p>This is one of the few times a police officer has ever been held criminally accountable for an on-duty shooting. But Slager’s is not a story about accountability, or about fair justice. Slager was caught dead-to-rights on video. The video of the shooting went viral and made national headlines. Even with that video, state prosecutors were unable to convict him. (A jury in state court deadlocked.) Slager finally pleaded guilty on the federal civil rights charges. My hunch is that was probably a strategic mistake. I’m not at all convinced that a jury would have convicted him in federal court, either. Juries just don’t like to convict cops.</p>

<p>Why so cynical? Consider that even as Slager’s sentence came down this week, a former Arizona police officer was acquitted after shooting and killing unarmed Daniel Shaver. Those who have seen the body-cam footage describe the shooting as an execution. Also this week, NYPD officers shot and killed a 69-year-old man during a 4 a.m. raid. The police were looking for a 30-year-old man on drug and gun charges. A 90-year-old man who was also in the apartment said the two thought they were being robbed. And in Los Angeles, we learned this week that more than 300 sheriff’s deputies are on a secret misconduct list for offenses ranging from lying under oath to domestic violence to possible sexual assault. But thanks to union-negotiated rules, that list is kept secret from the public, from defense attorneys and even from prosecutors. Not only were the deputies on the list never criminally charged, they get to keep testifying before juries. They get to keep sending people to prison.</p>

<p>But you needn’t even leave South Carolina to see just how anomalous Slager’s conviction really is. Last year, I published a series on policing in the state that included, among other incidents …</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A police raid for a misdemeanor gambling violation in which an officer shot and killed suspect Ernest Russell Jr. The officer’s report on the raid was so far removed from body-camera footage of the shooting that it’s hard to see how both could be about the same incident. The officer was never disciplined.</p></li>

<li><p>Another task force raid on a Myrtle Beach man for a couple of low-level marijuana sales that resulted in police shooting the suspect multiple times. The officers severely wounded the man and nearly killed him. He lost the use of several organs and is paralyzed. Ballistics testing showed that police claims that the man had fired a gun at them were wrong — the gun hadn’t been fired. Surveillance video then emerged that contradicted police claims to have knocked and announced multiple times before battering down the man’s door. None of the officers associated with the raid were ever disciplined.</p></li>

<li><p>A bogus police stop and roadside search in the town of Aiken that resulted in white officers probing a black man’s anus in search of drugs. There appeared to have been no justification for either the stop or the search. Audio of the search was captured on the officers’ microphones. One officer received extra training as a result of the incident.</p></li>

<li><p>In another incident, a police officer stopped a man after claiming the man activated his turn signal too late. Dash-cam footage shows that this was false. After a few minutes, the officer beat the man, then arrested him. The man was then subjected to numerous medical procedures without his consent. A prosecutor later dismissed all charges against the man. Not only were the officers involved never disciplined, but one was later promoted.</p></li>

<li><p>In 2014, a South Carolina police officer shot and killed a 70-year-old man after mistaking his gun for a cane. The officer was never charged.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a few examples. There have been numerous others, like the shooting of Zachary Hammond. In the police shooting of Lori Jean Ellis, forensic evidence directly contradicted police accounts of events leading up to the shooting. Yet investigators from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) — the agency that investigates such shootings — never looked into the discrepancies. One supervising agent said he didn’t need to, “because they’re police officers and I believe what they’re telling me.” Another investigator said he didn’t look into the contradictions because, “As the lead investigator for the state’s premiere law enforcement agency, it is my responsibility to put this case together. After looking at this information, I deemed that it was not necessary to interview that officer again. And that was the decision that I made.” He later admitted under oath that he doesn’t even always read the full forensics reports from officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>There have been at least a couple of other examples of South Carolina officers being held accountable, most notably Sean Groubert, the former state trooper who was sentenced to 12 years for shooting unarmed motorist Levar Jones. (Groubert is expected to be released after about three years). But that, too, was a case in which the shooting was caught on video, and in which the video went viral.</p>

<p>So when there has been damning video that attracted national attention, the police agencies that employed these officers immediately distanced themselves from the officers and attributed the shootings to the actions of some rogue cops who should have known better. Without video, however — or when whatever video there is fails to make national news — accountability is much harder to come by. More to the point, holding the occasional individual officers accountable for predictably tragic results caused by systemic problems may feel good in the short term, but it won’t stop people from getting killed.</p>

<p>Last year, The Watch published convincing evidence that SLED investigators had failed to look into serious and stark contradictions in police reports about incidents in which officers had shot and killed people. It included a SLED investigator admitting, on video, that he doesn’t even always read forensics reports for the cases he investigates. I found that in other police shootings, the SLED case summaries didn’t even bother trying to explain or further investigate major discrepancies between video footage and police reports.</p>

<p>After the series ran in June 2016, SLED chief Mark Keel responded in the Statehouse Report, a local publication that covers South Carolina politics. Here was his response:</p>

<p>“We recognize the recent series in the Washington Post’s website was the writer’s position and was appropriately labeled by The Post as opinion.</p>

<p>“SLED welcomes constructive criticism and input to better serve the law enforcement community and the people of South Carolina. Our agency’s services are nationally and internationally recognized and accredited.</p>

<p>“It would be easy to take offense based on the inaccuracies and misleading information in this series. That benefits only the writer and those who want to believe that law enforcement is somehow evil.</p>

<p>“Our commitment to the people we serve is thoroughly and fairly investigate criminal activity. That is what has made SLED a respected and progressive law enforcement agency.”</p>

<p>SLED is touted as the most elite and professional police agency in the state. It is tasked not only with investigating police shootings but also with training officers and setting standards for other police agencies to follow. Faced with credible allegations that his agency failed to meet its purported standards, Keel dismissed it all as the work of a mere opinion writer who thinks police are evil.</p>

<p>With that sort of leadership in South Carolina, expect to see more tragic and mistaken police shootings in the state. Occasionally, one of the officers might be held accountable, as Michael Slager was. But only under near-perfect conditions. Most won’t. In the meantime, there will be more Walter Scotts, Ernest Russells and Lori Jean Ellises.</p>

<h2 id="thisweekinthefourthamendmentcopsdrugsandthecastledoctrine">This week in the Fourth Amendment: Cops, drugs and the Castle Doctrine</h2>

<p>by: Radley Balko</p>

<p>date: 2017-12-03</p>

<p>url: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2017/12/04/this-week-in-the-fourth-amendment-cops-drugs-and-the-castle-doctrine/?noredirect=on </p>

<p>There have been a few notable Fourth Amendment stories in the news of late, both concerning police entering private homes in search of illicit drugs.</p>

<p>The first comes from Pennsylvania, where a couple are suing after police wrongly raided their home in search of marijuana. Yes. The drug is now legal for recreational use in eight states, but in states where it isn’t, police are still invading private homes to seize it.</p>

<p>And they’re still botching things.</p>

<p>A Buffalo Township couple is suing the township police and the Nationwide Insurance Co. after, their lawsuit says, hibiscus plants growing in their backyard were mistaken for marijuana plants.</p>

<p>In a lawsuit, Edward Cramer, 69, and his wife, Audrey Cramer, 66, claim that Buffalo Township police handcuffed them both and made them sit in the back of a police car for hours last month as police ransacked their house looking for marijuana.</p>

<p>But rather than running a pot-growing operation, the Cramers say they grow flowering hibiscus in their backyard.</p>

<p>The Cramers were not charged.</p>

<p>They filed a civil lawsuit Thursday in Butler County Court against Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., Nationwide agent Jonathan Yeamans, Buffalo Township and three of its police officers.</p>

<p>Among the allegations are use of excessive force, false arrest, false imprisonment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and invasion of privacy.</p>

<p>“Nationwide is not in a position to discuss the matter at this time,” company spokesman David Gilligan wrote in an email.</p>

<p>Buffalo Township police did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>

<p>The wild card this time was the Nationwide insurance agent, who — according to the lawsuit — tipped off the cops.</p>

<p>The trouble started when a neighbor’s tree fell on the [Cramers’] property in September.</p>

<p>The lawsuit states that Yeamans came to the property on Oct. 5 to investigate the insurance claim.</p>

<p>But the suit claims that Yeamans surreptitiously shot photos of the flowering hibiscus growing in the Cramers’ backyard and sent them to police as evidence of a marijuana grow operation.</p>

<p>According to the complaint, Yeamans “intentionally photographed the flowering hibiscus plants in such a manner as not to reveal that they had flowers on them so that they would appear to resemble marijuana plants.”</p>

<p>Based on those photos, the suit claims, Buffalo Township police Officer Jeffrey Sneddon obtained a search warrant for the Cramers’ property. The suit says that Sneddon claimed to have expertise in identifying marijuana.</p>

<p>As we well know, while the courts seem fine relying on a police officer’s “training and experience” to grant warrants for invasive drug raids, use of that phrase in warrant applications is basically boilerplate and means very little.</p>

<p>Nationwide deserves some bad publicity for this. Was the agent acting on his own volition, or does the company train its agents to report customers for suspicious activity? If it’s the latter, what sort of training do they get? Because hibiscus leaves look nothing like marijuana leaves. And the flowers aren’t remotely similar. According to the lawsuit, after the raid the company sent the couple a letter threatening to withdraw coverage unless they stopped growing pot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Reason’s Jacob Sullum reports some better news from state courts in Florida and Michigan. In Florida, an appeals court considered the claim of a man who was woken up at 7 a.m. as police battered down his door in search of pot. Here’s Sullum:</p>

<p>Florida’s Second District Court of Appeal concluded last month that the deputies had violated a state law governing “knock and announce” searches. The law allows an officer with a search warrant to break into a house “if after due notice of the officer’s authority and purpose he or she is refused admittance.” Since [Juan] Falcon and his family were asleep at the time of the search, Judge Susan Rothstein-Youakim wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel, the 15 to 20 seconds that the SWAT team waited was not enough time to conclude that they had been “refused admittance.” In fact, Falcon and his teenaged daughter were on their way to the door when the deputies forced it open, tossing two flashbang grenades as they did so.</p>

<p>Rothstein-Youakim noted that police violate the knock-and-announce law when they “knock, announce their authority and purpose, and then enter with such haste that the occupant does not have a reasonable opportunity to respond.” Without such an opportunity, what is nominally a knock-and-announce search is in practice indistinguishable from a no-knock search, which requires a special warrant based on circumstances that make the usual approach dangerous.</p>

<p>Rothstein-Youakim noted that police had no reason to believe that Falcon, whose criminal record was limited to a DUI arrest, was armed or would offer resistance. “The deputies also had no reason to believe that Falcon knew that they were coming, that anyone inside the residence was at risk of harm, or that Falcon or his family might try to escape or destroy evidence,” she wrote. But they did know that Falcon had two teenaged children and that the family was apt to be asleep at that hour, magnifying the risk that Falcon would mistake the deputies for burglars or do something they would interpret as threatening.</p>

<p>It’s pretty rare that a court gets a knock-and-announce analysis correct. This one did. The Michigan case stemmed from two predawn raids of men the police suspected of possessing “marijuana butter.” The police showed up before dawn, without a warrant, and bullied the men into consenting to searches. Here’s Sullum again:</p>

<p>According to the Michigan Supreme Court, “[Todd] Van Doorne considered arming himself, as did [Michael] Frederick’s wife.” You can imagine what might have happened if either of them had picked up a gun in self-defense …</p>

<p>The officers, part of the Kent Area Narcotics Enforcement Team, did not have a warrant. They defended their visits as “knock and talk” interactions that do not require judicial approval. But as the Michigan Supreme Court noted last June, that exception to the warrant requirement is based on the premise that police are doing nothing more than any member of the public is implicitly invited to do. “The scope of the implied license to approach a house and knock is time-sensitive,” the court said, and does not include hours when a home’s residents are likely to be asleep. Hence the officers who woke up Frederick and Van Doorne were trespassing on private property in the hope of gathering incriminating evidence, much like the cops who brought a drug-sniffing dog to the doorstep of a marijuana grower’s house in Florida v. Jardines, the 2013 case in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such an intrusion violates the Fourth Amendment.</p>

<p>Notably, both the majority and the dissenting justices in Jardines observed in passing that waking people up by knocking on their doors in the middle of the night is not something members of the general public are invited or expected to do. Having concluded that “the police were trespassing when they approached the defendants’ homes,” the Michigan Supreme Court instructed the Kent County Circuit Court to consider whether the evidence discovered by the subsequent, ostensibly consensual searches was nevertheless admissible. Last week Kent County Circuit Court Judge Dennis Leiber ruled that the evidence is so closely tied to the Fourth Amendment violations that it must be excluded, meaning that the cases against Frederick and Van Doorne cannot proceed.</p>

<p>For decades, the drug war has been eroding the “Castle Doctrine,” or the notion that the home should be a place of peace and sanctuary — and that such peace and sanctuary should be violated only under emergency, life-or-death conditions. The drug war has carved gaping exceptions to that doctrine, which dates back centuries to English common law. As with the other drug-war exceptions to the Fourth Amendment, the courts have been persuaded that pot and other drugs are such a threat to public safety that policing them is worth bringing state violence into private homes.</p>

<p>The fact that marijuana is now legal for recreational use in 16 percent of the states — while in the remaining states cops still exploit those exceptions to the Fourth Amendment to conduct violent raids in search of the very same drug — pretty persuasively demonstrates just how bogus and overblown the pot threat is, and always has been.</p>

<p>Here and there, we’re finally starting to see at least a little pushback, particularly at the state level. Let’s hope there’s more of it.</p>
