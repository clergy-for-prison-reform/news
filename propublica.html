<h2 id="howmitchmcconnellmadedonaldtrump">How Mitch McConnell Made Donald Trump</h2>

<p>by: Alec MacGillis</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-27</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/how-mitch-mcconnell-made-donald-trump </p>

<p>SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images </p>

<p>This article was co-published with the New York Times.</p>

<p>There is an unusual space in the basement of the University of Louisville library, in the large anteroom to the official archives for Sen. Mitch McConnell. The space is called the Civic Education Gallery, but it is, essentially, a kind of shrine to the political career of McConnell, not unlike the exhibits on Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron you’d find at the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>The mere fact of the shrine is curious enough, given that it memorializes a politician who shows no sign of leaving the stage any time soon. What’s most unusual, though, is what it chooses to highlight. There are a few artifacts from McConnell’s youth — his baseball glove, his honorary fraternity paddle — but most of the exhibits are devoted to the elections he won, starting with high school and on up through Jefferson County executive and the Senate.</p>

<p>When I visited the room while researching my 2014 biography on McConnell, I was struck by what was missing: exhibits on actual governing accomplishments from the Senate majority leader’s four decades in elected office. That absence confirmed my thesis that McConnell, far more even than other politicians, was motivated by the game of politics — winning elections and rising in the leadership ranks, achieving power for power’s sake — more than by any lasting policy goals.</p>

<p>Well, that was then. Four years later, it is becoming increasingly clear that Mitch McConnell is creating a legacy for himself, and it’s a mighty grand one.</p>

<p>McConnell has created the world in which we are now living. Donald Trump dominates our universe — and now has the power to fill the second Supreme Court seat in two years. McConnell, who has promised a vote on whomever the president nominates “this fall,” is the figure who was quietly making it all possible, all along.</p>

<p>First, there was McConnell’s vigorous defense, going back to the early 1990s, of the role of big money in American politics, which would help Trump not so much in terms of funding his campaign, but in helping shape the conditions for his appeal.</p>

<p>While McConnell has long cast his defense of campaign spending as a First Amendment issue — money is speech — he made no secret of his motivation for fighting so hard on the issue. Namely, that he was well aware that he, as someone lacking in natural campaign talents, and the rest of the Republican Party, as more business-oriented than the Democrats, would need to maintain the flow of large contributions to be able to win elections. “I will always be well financed, and I’ll be well financed early,” he declared after winning his first race for county executive, in 1977.</p>

<p>His crusade against campaign finance reform culminated in the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United ruling eliminating limits on corporate spending on elections, which McConnell followed up by blocking legislation to disclose the identity of large donors. Even before that ruling, the spread of big money in politics had done so much to sour the public on government, creating a ripe target for the Tea Party and, later, for a billionaire populist running against “the swamp.”</p>

<p>McConnell laid the groundwork for the right-wing insurgency of 2009 and 2010 in another way, too, with his decision to withhold Republican support for any major Democratic initiatives in the Obama years. This meant that Republicans had less influence on the final shape of legislation such as the Affordable Care Act than they would have had as fully willing negotiators.</p>

<p>Prioritizing elections over policy, McConnell calculated that by blocking or delaying Democratic legislation, above all through aggressive use of the filibuster, Republicans would create a tedious gridlock that voters would blame the Democrats for. After all, weren’t they the ones in power?</p>

<p>Can the Democrats Be as Stubborn as Mitch McConnell?</p>

<p>McConnell was right. This strategy helped to foment opposition to the health care bill, and to drive huge Republican gains in the 2010 election. But it also fueled the rise of the Tea Party, which was motivated substantially by the notion that Obama was “ramming things down our throats” — that is, passing legislation on a partisan basis after McConnell withheld any Republican negotiation. Of course, McConnell proceeded to have plenty of headaches managing the far-right contingent in his own caucus, but it was a contingent he helped produce.</p>

<p>His role in the election of Trump was even more direct. Most notable was his refusal to hold a confirmation hearing, let alone a vote, on Merrick Garland, Obama’s nominee to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, despite the fact that the nomination was made a full 10 months before the end of Obama’s term. This refusal exploded norms and dismayed Beltway arbiters who had long accepted McConnell’s claim to be a guardian of Washington institutions. It also provided crucial motivation to Republicans who had grave qualms about Trump but were able to justify voting for him as “saving Scalia’s seat.”</p>

<p>McConnell’s other form of aid for Trump was more hidden. As The Washington Post reported a month after the 2016 election, Obama had been prepared that September to go public with a C.I.A. assessment laying bare the extent of Russian intervention in the election. But he was largely dissuaded by a threat from McConnell. During a secret briefing for congressional leaders, The Post reported, McConnell “raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics.” The Obama administration kept mum, and voters had to wait until after Trump’s election to learn the depth of Russian involvement.</p>

<p>Now, with the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, it is evident just how much of a lasting legacy Mitch McConnell’s will leave the country: Donald Trump will have at least two lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court. The president has — and will now — enjoy greater latitude in filling those seats as a result of McConnell’s doing away last year with the 60-vote requirement for Senate confirmation, to get Neil Gorsuch seated. In the day and a half before Kennedy’s announcement, the impact of the Scalia seat was made plain again, as the court issued 5-4 rulings in favor of Trump’s “travel ban” and anti-abortion groups, and against public employee unions.</p>

<p>The abortion and union rulings had an ironic resonance, as far as Mr. McConnell goes. In the 1970s, when he ran for county executive in Louisville, he secured the pivotal endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. by pledging to back collective bargaining for public employees (a promise that went unfulfilled), and while in office he worked effectively behind the scenes to protect abortion rights locally.</p>

<p>But that was a long time ago, before McConnell saw the rightward swing of the Reagan revolution and decided to hop on board for his own political preservation as a Southern Republican. These days, McConnell has made explicit, with taunting tweets among other things, that he views long-term conservative control of the Supreme Court as his crowning achievement. It’s not hard to see why: Holding a long-term majority on the court greatly aids his highest cause — Republicans winning future elections — as recent rulings on voting rights and gerrymandering demonstrated once again.</p>

<p>Whether McConnell decides to add an exhibit in the Civic Education Gallery documenting his role in the rise of Donald Trump is another matter. The final historical judgment on that score will not rest with him, in any case.</p>

<h2 id="ijustwanttotellmysonilovehim">“I Just Want to Tell My Son I Love Him”</h2>

<p>by: Kavitha Surana</p>

<p>date: 2018-07-02</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/i-just-want-to-tell-my-son-i-love-him-letters-from-parents-immigration-detention </p>

<p>One father folded his note into an origami boat. “Open this boat. I love you my son,” he wrote in an attached note.</p>

<p>Zero Tolerance</p>

<p>LOS FRESNOS, Texas — Calling from an unreliable phone at the Port Isabel Detention Center, her voice sounds muffled, and far away. To be understood, she needs to keep repeating herself. For her to hear the person calling, they need to yell.</p>

<p>Blanca wishes more than anything else that it was her two daughters, ages 6 and 14, on the other end of the line. But she hasn’t spoken to them since they were separated at the border, after a long journey from Honduras. It’s been almost three weeks.</p>

<p>To arrange calls at the facility run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, parents need to fill out a request form. Blanca says she has submitted five.</p>

<p>“This is maddening,” she said. “The officials, they don’t say anything.”</p>

<p>As President Donald Trump’s “zero tolerance” policy, which separated more than 2,500 children from their parents at the border in May and June, stretches into its third month, the administration has to contend with some impending deadlines, set by a judge last week after the American Civil Liberties Union sued. By July 10, children under 5 must be reunited with their parents. By July 26, all families must be together. By Friday, officials must arrange phone calls between all parents and children.</p>

<p>But a week after Department of Homeland Security officials called their process to reunify families “well-coordinated,” many parents at Port Isabel — the primary facility housing separated parents — don’t know where their children are and some still haven’t been able to reach their kids, according to three detainees interviewed by ProPublica, along with two family members of parents inside and five lawyers granted broader access to the facility, who say they have interviewed more than 200 separated parents and guardians. ProPublica is not including the detainees’ last names at their request; their immigration cases are still pending.</p>

<p>“I just want to tell my son I love him,” sobbed Arely, a mother from El Salvador, during a phone call with a reporter. She, too, had been in detention almost three weeks without a call.</p>

<p>ICE did not immediately respond to questions posed Friday about parents not being able to speak with their children, and being in the dark about their whereabouts. It did not respond to additional questions posed Sunday about how many separated parents are being held at Port Isabel, how many have been able to speak with their kids, and whether any have been released on bond.</p>

<p>The parents wait in a detention center where the telephones barely work, there’s no internet, and officers shut off the TV news when the topic turns to immigration, the detainees said. Phone conversations are guarded — detainees know calls are recorded. Rumors are what’s left. There was one about detention officers urging people to sign deportation papers as the quickest way to see their kids again. It’s made detainees wary about signing any piece of paper, even when it comes from lawyers offering to help connect them with their kids, said Sophia Gregg, an immigration lawyer at Legal Aid Justice.</p>

<p>When she and a group of lawyers came from Washington, D.C., to conduct outreach interviews with the parents two weeks ago, many parents overcame their distrust enough to pass them letters, in hopes that the lawyers would find their children and deliver the messages. ProPublica reviewed a portion of the letters.</p>

<p>In one, a father tries to reassure his daughter. Don’t worry, because I am with you. I want to ask you to eat well, and if you eat well, then I will be happy.</p>

<p>In another, a mother apologizes to her daughter, for putting you in this situation that is so difficult … I just pray to God that you are well, because I am suffering a lot for you. I want this nightmare to end already, my love.</p>

<p>A father detained at Port Isabel Detention Center wrote a letter to his daughter. “Do not despair, very soon we will be together. I want to ask you to eat well and if you eat well I will be happy.”</p>

<p>No one outside DHS knows for sure how many separated parents are inside Port Isabel. Unlike some other immigrant detention facilities, this one does not make detainee information public, so the lawyers say it has taken extra work to reach parents. The lawyers who visited two weeks ago started with a small list of parents whose names they knew. Word of mouth within the dorms brought out more who previously had no contact with lawyers and no family members on the outside to help them.</p>

<p>The lawyers say they now have a list of more than 200 separated parents from Port Isabel. They hope a new database launched by the Vera Institute and New America will help reconnect the families.</p>

<p>When the lawyers first began reaching out to parents about three weeks ago, some told them they had been kept apart from their kids for days, others for close to a month. “ICE never came and talked to them and even asked if they were separated from their child,” said Jodi Goodwin, a local immigration lawyer. “Literally, there was zero communication at all.”</p>

<p>In conversations with the lawyers, parents weighed the decisions they’d have to make: Continue an asylum claim or choose deportation, hoping the U.S. government would stand by its word to reunite them with their children? If they lost their asylum claims, would they ask their children to give up theirs, too, or try to place them with family members in the U.S.? Some worried that their children were too young or did not know enough to accurately describe the danger in their home countries, especially after their parents had done their best to shield them from it. Such details are crucial to winning asylum cases.</p>

<p>Natasha Quiroga, an education civil rights lawyer who flew in from Washington to volunteer, said the stories flowed together: The mom concerned about her 7-year-old who is deaf and mute; the dad who had just signed his deportation orders, hoping it meant he would be reunified with his 4-year-old; the father who had no idea where his daughter was, and wanted to write a letter to her, but did not know how to write. Quiroga wrote the letter for him, transcribing as he repeated the same sentence over and over, telling her how much he loves her and how much he hopes to see her soon.</p>

<p>Such opportunities for contact with outsiders are rare at Port Isabel. The facility is tucked away down remote rural roads on Texas’ southeastern tip, making it difficult for lawyers to maintain a consistent presence.</p>

<p>Here’s What It’s Like to Work at a Shelter for Immigrant Kids</p>

<p>Trying to coordinate speaking with a detainee from outside is also difficult. ProPublica was able to arrange calls with three detained parents with the help of lawyers and a family member who contacted ProPublica about a relative’s case. People on the outside can call and leave messages asking a detainee to call them back, but cannot call a detainee directly. So parents call outsiders back at unexpected times. You must be available to pick up and sometimes have your credit card handy to pay for the call, or else lose the chance. Once on the line, their phones sometimes break up and lose service unexpectedly.</p>

<p>For those inside Port Isabel, access to information is limited, detainees said. After their plight became national news, detainees say televisions began to show only telenovelas and English programming. Parents said they weren’t aware of the court order on reunification until they heard from lawyers. Jenn Elzea, a spokesperson for ICE, said that only some televisions in the facility are controlled by detention staff. “They do have access, in theory, to television throughout the facility,” she said. ICE Detention standard guidelines say, “All television viewing schedules shall be subject to the facility administrator’s approval.”</p>

<p>Goodwin, one of the lawyers, said ICE confiscated letters addressed to detainees by reporters, and pulled three intended recipients out of their dorms to ask, “Why does his person have your name? Where did they get your information?”</p>

<p>ICE did not immediately respond to questions about this posed on Sunday.</p>

<p>Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada toured the facility last week and offered their assessments. “It’s clear … They’re not running a reunification process here,” Warren said. In response, ICE promised to set up phone calls for every separated parent to speak to their children, lawyers said. ICE has also clarified that physical reunifications will not be taking place at Port Isabel, a detention center where children are not allowed to be held. “We are reuniting people via communication,” said Elzea.</p>

<p>Left: “I love you more than my life,” a mother wrote. “Forgive me for having put you in this situation that is so difficult.” Right: “I know the separation is hard,” said a parent. “Ask God to bring us together again soon. I just want you to know that I love you.”</p>

<p>And so, this past week, a trickle of officially coordinated phone calls slowly began. Parents were called one by one to small visitation rooms to hear their children’s voices for a few minutes.</p>

<p>“An officer would dial the number, make sure the Office of Refugee Resettlement employee was on the other line, and bring the parent to take the call,” said Ruby Powers, an immigration attorney based out of Houston who volunteered at Port Isabel this week. “You could just see tears of joy,” she said. “You can tell from a parent who has talked to a child and one who hasn’t … The parent who has, has a lot more peace.”</p>

<p>Some parents were so overcome with emotion during the brief calls, it didn’t cross their minds to ask their children where exactly they were, Quiroga said. Before they knew it, time was up.</p>

<p>Some calls were difficult for other reasons.</p>

<p>One mother told Goodwin her 6-year-old didn’t want to talk to her on the phone “porque me abandonaste, mamá” — because you abandoned me, mommy.</p>

<p>And Daisy, a 21-year-old separated from her 12-year-old brother, hung up feeling unsettled after a vague conversation, she told ProPublica. Normally hyperactive, he answered her in monosyllables.</p>

<p>“How are you?” Daisy asked. Good, he said.</p>

<p>“How’s it going?” Fine.</p>

<p>“Are you eating well?” Yes.</p>

<p>“Are you having any fun there?” Yeah.</p>

<p>She said she brought her brother to the U.S. border from Honduras after their mother died. Their father was violent, she said, and she felt she was the only person looking out for him. Lawyers said they are worried the two may face even more roadblocks in trying to reunite, as Daisy is a sibling, not a mother.</p>

<p>“When I spoke with him, it’s not like when you have them near — I don’t know the truth,” Daisy said. “He says he is fine, but I won’t really know until I see him. Then I’ll know that he is well.”</p>

<p>Even when family members do connect, it’s far from clear what happens next in the hastily created reunification process.</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security appears to present deportation as the only path to reunification. The department’s zero tolerance fact sheet says “a parent who is ordered removed from the U.S. may request that his or her minor child accompany them,” but says nothing about reunifying families during the immigration process and beyond. (Reporters have also documented cases of parents who were deported without their children, before the fact sheet was released.)</p>

<p>Some parents drew pictures or wrote verses from the bible of resilience and protection. “Jehovah will watch over your coming and going both now and forevermore.”</p>

<p>For those who hold out hope that they will be able to receive asylum protection in the U.S., this weekend brought a glimpse of what reunification might look like when a mother was released Saturday from a detention center in Arizona, after she passed the first step of her asylum claim.</p>

<p>Supporters helped her pay a $7,500 bond with a crowdfunding campaign and drove her to New York, where her three children — 6, 9, and 11 — had been placed in foster homes. She’ll be able to visit them as much as she wants from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., but she can’t take custody of them while her asylum case is pending, The New York Times reported. A relative in North Carolina has applied to sponsor the children, but the mother probably won’t be able to live with them, because every adult in a sponsor’s home must be legally vetted.</p>

<p>At Port Isabel, lawyers say they know of no parents who have been released on bond into the U.S.</p>

<p>So Blanca waits, straining to hear what she can on her unreliable lifeline to the outside world. She said her sister-in-law told her that her daughters are now in a New York foster home. But a social worker told her sister-in-law the location is undisclosed, to protect the caregiver’s privacy.</p>

<h2 id="documentsraisenewconcernsaboutlithiumstudyonchildren">Documents Raise New Concerns About Lithium Study on Children</h2>

<p>by: Jodi S. Cohen</p>

<p>date: 2018-07-02</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/university-of-illinois-chicago-mani-pavuluri-lithium-study-complaints </p>

<p>Dr. Mani Pavuluri was long one of the University of Illinois at Chicago’s star pediatric psychiatrists.</p>

<p>Newly obtained records raise additional concerns about the research and oversight of Dr. Mani Pavuluri, a star pediatric psychiatrist at the University of Illinois at Chicago whose clinical trial studying the effects of the powerful drug lithium on children was shuttered for misconduct.</p>

<p>ProPublica Illinois has learned:</p>

<pre><code>•   Parents of at least eight children who participated in Pavuluri’s trials contacted UIC after learning she had violated research rules, a larger number than the university previously disclosed — though UIC officials insist only one of the queries was a complaint.

•   Pavuluri enrolled 101 children and teens diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the lithium study before it was halted when one of the young subjects became ill. UIC officials previously declined to answer questions about how many children participated in the government-funded study, citing an ongoing federal investigation.

•   The psychiatrist’s two young sons were among 132 children and teens who participated as healthy control subjects, a violation of university protocol and generally accepted research practices.
</code></pre>

<p>A ProPublica Illinois investigation earlier this year revealed that the National Institute of Mental Health ordered the university to repay $3.1 million in grant money it had received to fund Pavuluri’s study. The five-year study, “Affective Neuroscience of Pediatric Bipolar Disorder,” used imaging to look at how the brains of adolescents with bipolar disorder functioned before and after taking the lithium. The scans were compared to brain images of healthy, unmedicated children.</p>

<p>NIMH demanded the refund, a rare rebuke, after determining there had been “serious and continuing noncompliance” by Pavuluri as well as failures by the university’s institutional review board, or IRB, a faculty panel responsible for reviewing research involving human subjects.</p>

<p>Among other findings, NIMH concluded Pavuluri tested lithium on children younger than 13 though she was told not to and failed to properly alert parents of the study’s risks. A university investigation concluded she falsified data to cover up the misconduct, according to documents.</p>

<p>The ProPublica Illinois investigation found that UIC officials didn’t properly screen or monitor Pavuluri’s research — and then, after realizing she had broken rules, continued to promote her expertise to the public as she maintained an active medical practice for years. She resigned from UIC effective June 30.</p>

<p>She plans to open a treatment center, called the Brain and Wellness Institute, in Lincoln Park, according to a website.</p>

<p>Pavuluri did not return calls seeking comment.</p>

<p>Pavuluri joined the psychiatry department at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in 2000 and founded the Pediatric Mood Disorders Program, which became a nationally renowned clinic that drew children with bipolar disorder and other mood-related mental illnesses from around the country.</p>

<p>She was paid about $200,000 a year, plus bonuses. In addition to her research, she treated and oversaw the care of thousands of children, including 1,200 in the five years after her research came under scrutiny.</p>

<p>Pavuluri’s lithium study began in 2009 and was halted in 2013 along with two other federally funded projects she oversaw. The university had previously returned nearly $800,000 that hadn’t yet been spent on those two studies, and then in December repaid the $3.1 million out of a fund designated for research, administration, student scholarships and building operations.</p>

<p>University officials have said they are not sure what they won’t be able to fund as a result.</p>

<p>University officials have declined to speak about the matter, instead answering questions only by email. When asked in April how many complaints UIC had received from Pavuluri’s patients or research subjects, officials responded that they received one letter on behalf of a study subject concerning a possible malpractice claim.</p>

<p>That family contacted UIC after receiving a letter in June 2014 that the university sent to families alerting them of problems with Pavuluri’s research. The letter explained that children enrolled in three of her studies may have been put at greater risk than what had been explained in consent and parental permission forms. That family didn’t file a claim, UIC has said.</p>

<p>Records obtained recently by ProPublica Illinois, however, show there were at least seven other families who contacted UIC after receiving the June 2014 letter. A UIC employee who compiled a spreadsheet of the calls also wrote summaries of two of them, describing them as “complaints by parents regarding the treatment of their child as a research subject,” according to an email obtained by ProPublica Illinois.</p>

<p>UIC officials still maintain the calls were “inquiries” and not complaints, and therefore say they responded accurately to ProPublica Illinois’ questions earlier this year.</p>

<p>“The University interpreted your use of the word complaint consistent with the definition of the word found in Merriam-Webster Dictionary (online version): ‘a formal allegation against a party.’”</p>

<p>ProPublica Illinois screenshot</p>

<p>That is one of three definitions provided by Merriam-Webster. Complaint also is defined in a broader way as an “expression of grief, pain, or dissatisfaction.”</p>

<p>The mother of one child in the study who called UIC after receiving the letter — not the family who suggested the malpractice claim — said she wanted the university “to know that there was a negative impact on my child.”</p>

<p>“I was telling them my child was harmed by this study,” she said. “To me, that is a complaint.”</p>

<p>While she didn’t request any specific action, she said she is disappointed to know her call was simply considered a “response to the letter.” She said she never heard back from school officials.</p>

<p>“I wanted it to matter that he was harmed and for that to figure into decisions they made in the future about Dr. Pavuluri and how studies are supervised in general,” said the mother, whose son was 10 when he participated in the study. The woman asked not to be identified to protect her son’s privacy.</p>

<p>ProPublica Illinois in March requested the enrollment log for the lithium study under the Freedom of Information Act to confirm how many children were provided lithium. The university declined to provide the document and did not answer questions about the number of participants, citing federal and state laws regarding patient privacy as well as an ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>ProPublica Illinois appealed to the Illinois attorney general, whose public access counselor handles FOIA appeals, and the university provided the log in June. Other appeals to the public access counselor are pending.</p>

<p>The log shows that 101 children in the group designated to take lithium were enrolled between February 2009 and Jan. 25, 2013 — the same day UIC reported to federal officials that one of the subjects became ill.</p>

<p>NIMH would later conclude that about 86 percent of the subjects did not meet the eligibility criteria to participate because they were either younger than 13, had previously used psychotropic medication or had other reasons for being ineligible, records show.</p>

<p>The 132 healthy subjects enrolled between January 2009 and October 2011. They completed various tasks while undergoing brain scans and had their blood drawn. They were to be paid $100 for participating, documents show.</p>

<p>Pavuluri’s sons, who were then 11 and 14, were signed up to participate in the study as healthy controls, documents show. Pavuluri signed the parental consent forms and her sons signed what’s known as an assent form to agree to participate.</p>

<p>Dive deeper into our reporting. Our newsletter is written by a ProPublica Illinois journalist every week.</p>

<p>UIC officials did not answer questions about why Pavuluri’s sons were allowed to enroll or if they were paid. Instead, they wrote: “Based on customary practices, the IRB would not approve of a researcher enrolling family members in their own research studies.”</p>

<p>Michael Carome, a former senior official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Human Research Protections, said there are ethical concerns about a parent consenting on behalf of their children to participate in their own research — “particularly research that might be quite stressful for a child.”</p>

<p>“At a minimum, the researcher should not have done that without seeking approval from the IRB,” Carome said.</p>

<p>Records show Pavuluri’s research was riddled with oversight failures as the IRB approved changes to the study — including lowering the minimum age of participants to 10 even though NIMH specifically prohibited that.</p>

<p>There also were shortcomings in independent oversight as the study progressed. For one, Pavuluri and a co-investigator were members of the trial’s Data Safety and Monitoring Board, which is tasked with observing a trial’s progress and the safety of its participants. NIH policy recommends that board members “are in no way associated with the trial.”</p>

<p>In an interview earlier this year, Pavuluri described the mistakes as oversights while she oversaw multiple studies and said she made decisions in the best interests of her patients. She said she received minimal training and guidance from the university.</p>

<p>“I was careful and tried to do my best with each individual child,” she said. “I thought that I could manage that pretty reasonably and that is something that I didn’t estimate that this would have such serious consequences, quite frankly.”</p>

<p>Pavuluri’s research remains under investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general’s office, which examines waste, fraud and abuse in government programs, and the Office of Research Integrity, records show.</p>

<h2 id="ivebeenreportingonms13forayearherearethe5thingstrumpgetsmostwrong">I’ve Been Reporting on MS-13 for a Year. Here Are the 5 Things Trump Gets Most Wrong.</h2>

<p>by: Hannah Dreier</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-24</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/ms-13-immigration-facts-what-trump-administration-gets-wrong </p>

<p>Zero Tolerance</p>

<p>There’s one thing everyone can agree with President Donald Trump on about the street gang MS-13: The group specializes in spectacular violence. Its members attack in groups, in the woods, at night, luring teens to their deaths with the promise of girls or weed. One Long Island boy told me he doesn’t go to parties anymore because he worries any invitation could be a trap. A victim’s father showed me a death certificate that said his son’s head had been bashed in, then lowered his voice and added that the boy’s bones had been marked by machete slashes, but he didn’t want the mother to know that. A teenager who has left the gang told me he considers himself dead already, and is just trying to make sure MS-13 doesn’t kill his family.</p>

<p>I’m spending the year reporting on MS-13 members and their associates. I’ve been combing through their text messages. I’m talking with the detectives building cases against killers not yet old enough to buy cigarettes. And I’ve been spending long evenings with the gang’s victims, who often start crying as soon as they start talking about the violence that has marred their lives. Everyone agrees the gang is bloodthirsty. Most of the other assertions I’ve heard from the Trump administration this year about MS-13 have almost no connection to what I’m seeing on the ground.</p>

<ol>
<li>MS-13 Is Not Organizing to Foil Immigration Law</li>
</ol>

<p>Trump often talks about how MS-13 has carried out a string of murders in the suburbs outside New York City. One of the first things I did when I started reporting was talk to the ex-girlfriend of the gang leader charged with ordering six of those killings in 2016 and 2017. The girl sat at a Panera Bread in a Long Island strip mall and told how he had kidnapped and raped her shortly after her 15th birthday, threatened her family, and forced her to get a tattoo of his name on her arm. As I talked to her, I imagined a man like the ones I had seen in news reports on MS-13 — chins jutted out, arms strong from lifting weights, and gothic tattoos of the letters M and S on their faces and chests. I was shocked when I eventually saw this gang leader in court; he was a baby-faced 19-year-old who blushed when girls waved to him from the gallery. The indictment against him laid out killings that were ordered in response to adolescent trash talking.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions has called MS-13 the most brutal of the gangs driving the drug trade, and promised to go after the group like the government went after mob boss Al Capone. Really, experts have found the gang has barely any role in the international drug trade. The Congressional Research Service said that it could be misleading to call MS-13 a transnational criminal organization at all, because it has no central leader or global ambitions. The gang is made up of sometimes competing cliques, often led by teenagers most interested in wielding power over other young people in their immediate circles.</p>

<p>On Long Island, a detective told me police officers call MS-13 members “mighty munchkins,” because they have often not yet hit their growth spurts and tend to commit their crimes in large groups. They meet at night because, while other criminal organizations have massive international revenue streams, these guys — even the leaders — have to work menial jobs and sometimes go to school during the day. Each clique has its own shot caller, and its own hyperlocal focus. On Long Island, the gang’s focus has often been on controlling the halls of a single high school.</p>

<ol>
<li>MS-13 Is Not Posing as Fake Families at the Border</li>
</ol>

<p>In justifying the policy of child separation last week, Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen said, “The kids are being used as pawns by the smugglers and the traffickers. Those are traffickers, those are smugglers and that is MS-13.” The theory is that Central American gang leaders are showing up at the border falsely claiming to be the parents of children, and are also instructing unaccompanied minors to go to the U.S. and claim territory.</p>

<p>Actually, there have been fewer than 200 cases of false family claims this year — a fraction of 1 percent of the total number of families apprehended at the border — and there is no indication that any of those cases involved MS-13. Of the hundreds of thousands of unaccompanied minors that have come to the U.S. since 2012, Border Patrol says only 56 were suspected of MS-13 ties.</p>

<p>The gang is trying to find new members, but there’s no need to step on the toes of the Mexican gangs that control human smuggling to do it. Long Island teenagers tell me that when they show up to school, gang members sit down next to them at lunch and ask them to join. Many— worn down by loneliness, boredom and the threat of violence if they try to refuse — accept the invitation.</p>

<p>People who study MS-13 agree that when young gang members travel from El Salvador to the U.S., they are driven by the same economic factors driving other Central American immigrants. Even the 19-year-old gang leader charged with six murders on Long Island told his ex-girlfriend he was not a member of the gang when he came to the U.S. from El Salvador. He said it was only later, in the New York suburbs, that he was recruited.</p>

<p>And some MS-13 members are born right here. The Suffolk County Police Department examined a sample of active MS-13 members and found that just a quarter had come to the U.S. as unaccompanied minors. The natural conclusion: This is not a border issue. It’s a recruitment issue.</p>

<ol>
<li>MS-13 Is Sticking Around, but It’s Not Growing</li>
</ol>

<p>Trump talks about the gang as if it is suddenly taking over. “The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S.,” he wrote in a tweet.</p>

<p>MS-13 has been stubbornly persistent, but it remains a boutique criminal organization, accounting for a tiny portion of 1.4 million gang members nationwide. Trump’s Justice Department says there are about 10,000 MS-13 members in the U.S., the same number as 10 years ago. There’s also nothing new about MS-13 alarmism. Back in 2005, Newsweek ran a cover story about the group, citing its 10,000 members, under the headline, “The most dangerous gang in America.”</p>

<p>On Long Island, the murder people cite most often when talking about MS-13’s brutality is the killing of a two-year-old and his mother back in 2010. But the gang’s history goes back much further than that; the FBI set up a Long Island task force to crack down on the gang in 2003. And MS-13 never invaded the U.S at all. It was founded in Los Angeles in the 1980s, and then mixed with California prison gang culture and was exported to El Salvador.</p>

<p>The group remains significantly smaller than the Crips, the Bloods and the Latin Kings; it’s also smaller than several gangs you’ve probably never heard of, like the Gangster Disciples in Chicago. Even the Center for Immigration Studies, which has been labeled an extremist group for its anti-immigrant ideology, can’t come up with more than an average of 35 murders per year attributed to MS-13 — far fewer than that Chicago gang you didn’t know existed.</p>

<p>MS-13 is not the largest, the most violent, or the fastest-growing gang, but it is the U.S. gang most strongly tied to Central America, which is where the majority of asylum-seeking teenagers come from. In that way, it’s the perfect focal point for Trump’s message of closed borders.</p>

<ol>
<li>MS-13 Is Preying on a Specific Community, Not the Country at Large</li>
</ol>

<p>When confronted last week with audio obtained by ProPublica of wailing children separated from their parents, White House Communications Adviser Mercedes Schlapp said, “What’s very heartbreaking is to watch Americans who have lost their children because of the MS-13 gang members.” But the vast majority of MS-13 victims are young immigrants, many of them undocumented.</p>

<p>I often think about this when I’m out reporting. This year, I have reached out to current gang members and added them as friends on Facebook. I’ve visited the homes of people on the local clique’s kill list, and heard their police-issued panic buttons hum under tables and behind doors. I’ve explored the wooded areas Long Island police call “the killing fields,” where bodies have been found. I feel safe doing this because MS-13 rarely goes after true outsiders — people who are not friends with any gang members or targets for recruitment. The closest I’ve found in Long Island to a totally random victim was a worker at a Central American deli who was hurt when a bullet passed through the head of a targeted victim.</p>

<p>The White House put out a statement last month that described recent murders carried out by “MS-13 animals.” Lost in the controversy over whether it was OK to call gang members animals was the fact that of the six identified victims, five were immigrants and the other was a child of immigrants.</p>

<ol>
<li>Immigration Raids and Deportation Can Only Go So Far</li>
</ol>

<p>Secretary Nielsen said last week that the presence of MS-13 in the U.S. is “the exclusive product of loopholes in our federal immigration laws.” The loopholes she is talking about are actually specific protections contained in United Nations conventions on refugees and torture, which the U.S. ratified. The U.S. is obligated to allow Central American immigrants to stay in the country while their asylum claims are processed, which can take years. If the person pleading asylum is a minor, they are supposed to be released to relatives.</p>

<p>A Betrayal</p>

<p>But if U.S. officials determine that a teenager is a gang member, they stay in custody. And immigration officials can also re-detain teenagers who are recruited into MS-13 once they get here. Dozens of Long Island teenagers were re-detained last year on suspicion of gang ties. The problem is that it can be hard to tell who is in the gang and who is just adopting gang style. MS-13 has its own music and aesthetic, bound up in Central American pride. On Long Island, some immigrant teens use MS-13 markers as a fashion statement, the way American kids might once have worn the blue bandanas associated with the Crips because they liked Snoop Dogg.</p>

<p>I sat in on one hearing for a Long Island 17-year-old who had been detained for half a year after he wrote the El Salvador telephone code, “503,” in a notebook at school. He had spent some of that time in a detention center now under investigation for child abuse. At the hearing, an immigration judge ordered the teen released and openly mocked the gang charges. “I note that ‘503’ is an area code,” the judge said. “He may have had his grandmother’s phone number written in his notebook. We don’t know. But I think this is slim, slim evidence on which to base the continuing detention of an unaccompanied child.”</p>

<p>That’s not to say that all of the immigrant teenagers accused of gang affiliation are innocent. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement has arrested some 8,000 suspected MS-13 members in the past decade. If deportation was all it took, the gang would be gone by now.</p>

<p>So What?</p>

<p>This all matters because the gang really is terrorizing a portion of the population: young Latino immigrants in a few specific communities.</p>

<p>Last month, I accompanied the mother of a high school freshman killed by MS-13 to a Trump event on Long Island. Inside a government building, the president railed against the gang. “They killed a cop for the sake of making a statement. They wanted to make a statement, so they killed a cop,” he said. (They did not kill a cop.)</p>

<p>Outside, the mother drifted between a pro-Trump rally and a counter protest. She took tranquilizer pills so she could face local reporters, and then told them she was unsure if Trump really cared about victims like her. She said she hoped the president’s fixation on MS-13 might spur changes that will keep other kids from being attacked and recruited by the gang.</p>

<p>But for any policy to work, it needs to be rooted in reality.</p>

<h2 id="jaredkushnersgrandmotherbemoanedthecloseddoorsthatfacedrefugeestoamerica">Jared Kushner’s Grandmother Bemoaned the “Closed Doors” That Faced Refugees to America</h2>

<p>by: Allan Sloan</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-22</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/jared-kushner-grandparents-refugees-america-immigration </p>

<p>Jared Kushner speaks during the dedication ceremony of the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel, on May 14, 2018.</p>

<p>This article was co-published with The Washington Post.</p>

<p>Way before Jared Kushner became internationally famous by moving into the White House to work for his father-in-law Donald Trump, those of us who live in New Jersey knew the family was an amazing story of immigrant success.</p>

<p>Jared Kushner’s paternal grandparents, Holocaust survivors Joseph and Rae Kushner, came to the United States in 1949 as impoverished Eastern European refugees and begat a family whose office buildings, apartment complexes and philanthropic efforts are important parts of the business and social landscapes in New Jersey and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Yes, there are scandals and feuds besetting parts of the family, and Jared’s father Charles racked up some prison time. But the family’s rise from refugees to titans is an example of what can happen when people are admitted into this country, work hard and prosper.</p>

<p>I got curious about the Kushner history after Jared invoked his immigrant forbears in his recent speech at the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. “I keep a photo of them on my desk” in the White House, he said.</p>

<p>As a grandson of Jewish Eastern European immigrants myself — my late father and Kushner’s late grandmother even had the same birth name, Slonimsky, but spelled it differently — I was impressed that Kushner remembers his roots and discusses his origins publicly.</p>

<p>But I wondered how — or if — Kushner could reconcile his father-in-law’s “keep ’em out” immigration philosophy with the story of his paternal grandparents, who spent 3 1/2 years in a displaced persons camp in Italy before being admitted to the U.S. In a 1982 interview given by the late Rae Kushner to a Holocaust research center, Jared’s grandmother talks about how wrong she felt it was for the U.S. to let people like her and her husband languish in displaced persons camps for years awaiting permission to enter the country.</p>

<p>I was especially taken by this portion: “The day after we got married [in Budapest, Hungary], we smuggled ourselves over the border into Italy,” Rae Kushner said. “This was our honeymoon. In Italy, we sat in a displaced persons camp. It was like being in the ghetto again. … Nobody wanted to take us in. So for 3 1/2 years we waited until we finally got a visa to come to the United States.”</p>

<p>Later on, she says that, “For the Jews, the doors were closed. We never understood that. Even President Roosevelt kept the doors closed. Why?”</p>

<p>Behind the Criminal Immigration Law: Eugenics and White Supremacy</p>

<p>ProPublica has obtained audio from inside a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility, in which children can be heard wailing as an agent jokes, “We have an orchestra here.”</p>

<p>The answer, of course, can be found by looking at some less-than-inspiring U.S. history. The Immigration Act of 1924 set stringent limits on the number of people the U.S. would admit from Poland (where Joseph and Rae Kushner were from) and other Eastern European countries. Franklin Roosevelt didn’t seek to make exceptions to those rules — perhaps because, in addition to the immigration quotas, there was a nasty outfit called the America First Committee. Its prominent members included Charles Lindbergh, the famous aviator, and its supporters included Father Charles Coughlin, the anti-Semite who gained huge popularity as “the Radio Priest from Royal Oak, Michigan.” The committee tried to keep the U.S. out of World War II and blamed American Jews for supposedly pushing Roosevelt to have our country enter the hostilities. The committee folded after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, but its influence lingered.</p>

<p>It all added up to huge impediments for Jewish refugees to enter the United States. I wanted to know how Kushner reconciles his family immigration history with his father-in-law’s immigration policies. I also wanted to find out if Kushner knew the history of “America First,” which my children, who are members of Kushner’s generation, said they hadn’t heard about until I mentioned it to them recently.</p>

<p>So I sent the White House press office an email outlining some of the major elements in this column, asking for comment or a conversation. I never heard back.</p>

<p>Perhaps Kushner opposes large parts of his father-in-law’s immigration program, and has been opposing it privately. But it’s also possible that Kushner has no problem reconciling his family history with Trump’s policies. Rae Kushner was an eloquent, plainspoken critic of U.S. immigration policies. Her grandson Jared’s public silence speaks volumes, too, in its own way.</p>

<h2 id="fora6yearoldsnaredintheimmigrationmazeamemorizedphonenumberprovesalifeline">For a 6-Year-Old Snared in the Immigration Maze, a Memorized Phone Number Proves a Lifeline</h2>

<p>by: Ginger Thompson</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-21</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/for-a-6-year-old-snared-in-the-immigration-maze-a-memorized-phone-number-proves-a-lifeline </p>

<p>Via Facebook</p>

<p>Zero Tolerance</p>

<p>On a hot and steamy Sunday morning, the man smuggling 6-year-old Alison Jimena Valencia Madrid and her mother, Cindy, across the border into the United States told them to be ready to depart soon. Cindy Madrid, exhausted and excited, called her sisters in Houston — the final leg of their month-long journey from El Salvador was about to begin. The sisters whispered a prayer into the phone, asking God to go with them. Then one sister grew serious: Make sure Jimena memorizes my phone number in case you are separated from one another along the way.</p>

<p>“How do you expect me to do that?” Madrid asked in a panic. “There’s not enough time.”</p>

<p>The sisters were firm. “We don’t know how. But do it.”</p>

<p>One whirlwind week later, that number, drilled into Jimena’s head by rote as she and her mother rafted across the Rio Grande, has become the little girl’s lifeline. Shortly after setting foot in Texas on June 13, they were detained and Border Patrol officials separated mother from daughter as part of the Trump administration’s zero tolerance enforcement policy. But Jimena’s ability to recall her aunt’s phone number through the trauma of that separation has, so far, kept her from becoming lost in a system that has taken more than 2,300 immigrant children from their parents.</p>

<p>Jimena’s insistent pleas for a phone call at a Border Patrol detention facility, captured on an audio recording provided to ProPublica, quickly became the searing incarnation of what the Trump administration is doing to children. Almost instantly, Jimena’s voice was everywhere; listened to millions of times in homes, at protests, and even the White House press briefing room. The seven-minute audio crystallized the impact the policy was having on children, stirring outrage.</p>

<p>“After all she’s gone through, her reward is that she’s become the voice for all the children in that situation,” said her aunt, a Salvadoran woman who is seeking asylum and asked not to be identified because she worries about how public attention might affect her case.</p>

<p>The path ahead for both Jimena and her family remains uncertain. Under withering attack from foes and friends alike, President Donald Trump on Wednesday appeared to retreat from the policy, saying he had instructed authorities to stop separating immigrant families and start reuniting them. And today, administration officials suggested that they might undo their decision to criminally prosecute every immigrant caught illegally crossing the border.</p>

<p>But thus far, the president has provided no clear plan for implementing his instructions. And, while it only took the stroke of a pen to both create and, perhaps, scuttle the policy, its effects have wrought havoc on an immigration enforcement system already widely recognized as failing. Now that same system faces the daunting task of putting those families back together. Jimena’s case opens a window into how that process will work.</p>

<p>“Whether or not my sister and niece are able to stay in the country, the most important thing is that they are reunified,” said Jimena’s aunt. Speaking of her niece, she added, “What we don’t want is to lose her.”</p>

<p>And she worried about the other children stuck in the same predicament. “It’s really hard,” she said. “I can’t imagine the magnitude of these children’s suffering, the psychological and emotional damage that the older and younger kids there have.”</p>

<p>Memorizing her aunt’s phone number gave Jimena a huge advantage over many of the immigrant children who are illegally brought across the border by their families, and who are not old enough to speak, count, or even know their parents’ full names. Central American consular workers and child advocates report that, under zero tolerance, once children have been physically separated from their parents, their legal cases have been bureaucratically separated as well. The children have been treated like unaccompanied minors, even as their relatives were shipped to other U.S. detention centers. Now that the policy of separating families appears to have ended, the burden of the reunification will depend in large measure on the children’s abilities to provide information that will help authorities identify who, and where, their parents are.</p>

<p>The audio provided to ProPublica last week shows how difficult that will be. In it, nearly a dozen Central American children between the ages of four and 10 wail inconsolably. Consular officials struggle to get the children to stop crying long enough to tell them where they came from, and whether they came with their mothers or their fathers. The children are so distraught, they sound as if they can barely breathe. And they scream “Mami” and “Papá” as if those are the only words they know.</p>

<p>Amid the chaos, Jimena is heard, asking in full sentences for authorities to help her call her aunt. When they do not respond, she presses her point: “My mommy says that I’ll go with my aunt, and that she will come to pick me up there as quickly as possible so I can go with her.”</p>

<p>Jimena’s aunt said the consular official who eventually helped Jimena call her was struck by the child’s ability to stay composed under that kind of pressure. “Of all the children here, she’s the only one who provided information,” the official told her. “Most children here aren’t able to give names, much less a phone number.’”</p>

<p>The aunt said when she first heard Jimena’s voice on the phone “I threw myself out of bed and fell on my knees. I thanked God that she remembered the number. If not, I don’t know what would have happened to her.”</p>

<p>Still, even though the authorities know where her mother is, Jimena has not been given a chance to speak to her mother since they were separated. And while authorities have told the family that Jimena will be reunited with her mother, they have not said when.</p>

<p>A staff member at the shelter in Phoenix, Arizona, where Jimena is being held couldn’t fully explain why the girl had not been allowed to speak to her mother, or even whether her mother had been consulted about vaccinations Jimena has received. The shelter worker, who would not provide her name, said that at one point, when Jimena’s mother called from an immigration detention facility in Port Isabel, Texas, the little girl was in a mandatory “Know Your Rights” workshop and couldn’t be excused to take the call. The shelter worker said the mother, who has very little money to pay for phone calls and spotty access to a telephone, was told to call back.</p>

<p>“I can’t say exactly why we haven’t been able to get Mom to talk to her daughter,” the shelter worker said. “But we are hoping to get Mom on the phone with her soon.”</p>

<p>In the meantime, the aunt passes messages between Jimena and her mother. She talked about her niece’s ordeal during an extensive interview in her tiny, rundown apartment on the southwest side of Houston. Her relief at finding her niece was palpable. She shared dozens of family photos, and showed the outpouring of messages on her Facebook page, joking about how she’s had her own “five minutes of fame,” thanks to her niece’s renown.</p>

<p>During the interview, both Jimena and her mother called the aunt. Madrid came to the United States from a small town outside her country’s capital, fleeing gang violence. She was cautiously optimistic about the prospect of reuniting with her daughter. She said other detainees had told her they heard Jimena on TV. “I’m so proud. She’s a very smart girl, very brave.”</p>

<p>Jimena, now happily connected to her aunt and her mom, sounded almost chirpy when she called, her rapid-fire way of talking making it hard for non-native Spanish speakers to catch everything she said. She organized her thoughts in lists, running through the activities of her day, the meals she likes and doesn’t like, and numbers and locations of vaccinations she’s received. One, she said, playfully pausing as if delivering a punch line, was “right on the very, very bottom of my butt.”</p>

<p>What she talked most about was not where she is, but were she wants to be: with her mother, outside of detention. When she gets there, she said she already knows the pets she wants to buy and the kinds of pizzas she wants to eat. She blew kisses through the phone to her favorite cousin and asked whether they can go to the same school. Then she asked her aunt whether she has a bathtub, warning: “You’re going to have to bathe me, because I’m going to be very dirty when I get there.” And then, her silly tone softened and she asked her aunt when she would see her mother again.</p>

<p>The aunt had no answer. “We don’t know yet, my love,” the aunt told her. “But she told me to tell you to behave yourself and be strong, until you’re back together.”</p>

<p>Every year, the U.S. Department of Education investigates thousands of school districts and colleges around the country for civil rights violations ranging from racial discrimination in school discipline to sexual violence.

<p>For the first time ever, ProPublica is making available the status of all of the civil rights cases that have been resolved during the past three years, as well as pending investigations. See if your school district or college is being investigated for civil rights violations and why.</p>

<p>Check if Your School Has Been Investigated</p>

<p>The resolved data includes all cases the Office for Civil Rights reported as resolved between Jan. 20, 2015, and May 2, 2018. ProPublica has also added about 220 cases, most of which were resolved in a two-week period in December 2017, that were omitted from the most recent data provided by the Department of Education. Dates for when these cases were opened are not yet available.</p>

<p>The open case data includes open cases as of April 27, 2018. Unlike the resolved data, each entry in the open case data represents an individual allegation that may be associated with a broader probe. Similarly, there may be multiple open cases, even if only one allegation appears on a school’s page. We will be updating the open investigation data as it becomes available. If you notice any errors, or if you know of civil rights cases at a school or district that are not represented in our data, contact annie.waldman@propublica.org.</p>

<p>If an investigation found insufficient evidence of noncompliance, or all claims in a case were dismissed or administratively closed, we considered the case to be resolved with no findings of violations or corrective change. If OCR settled with an entity through a resolution agreement, enforcement, a complaint mediation process, or other OCR involvement, we considered the case to be resolved with findings of violations or corrective change. If one allegation in a case resulted in a finding of noncompliance or corrective change, we marked the entire case as having findings of noncompliance or corrective change.</p>

<p>ProPublica has also standardized comparable resolution and allegation issue descriptions.</p>

<h2 id="devoshasscuttledmorethan1200civilrightsprobesinheritedfromobama">DeVos Has Scuttled More Than 1,200 Civil Rights Probes Inherited From Obama</h2>

<p>by: Annie Waldman</p>

<p>date: 2010-06-20</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/devos-has-scuttled-more-than-1-200-civil-rights-probes-inherited-from-obama </p>

<p>André da Loba, special to ProPublica</p>

<p>Whether schoolchildren in DeSoto County, Mississippi, are paddled varies by their race. Black students are almost two and a half times more likely than whites to endure the corporal punishment permitted under school district policy for skipping class, insubordination, repeated tardiness, flagrant dress code violations, or other misbehavior: up to three “licks per incident on the buttocks with an appropriate instrument approved by the principal.”</p>

<p>Black students in DeSoto — a suburban area just south of Memphis, Tennessee — are also more prone to face other forms of school discipline. While comprising 35 percent of district enrollment, they account for 55 percent of suspensions and expulsions, and more than 60 percent of referrals to law enforcement, federal education data shows.</p>

<p>Has Your School Been Investigated for Civil Rights Violations?</p>

<p>Citing such disparities, a group of families in the county filed a federal complaint in 2015 with the help of the Advancement Project, a national advocacy group. For three years, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights investigated DeSoto, visiting schools and meeting with parents and administrators, according to the complainants. Then, this past April, the department closed the probe without finding any violation, due to “insufficient evidence.”</p>

<p>“This is indicative of how they are now evaluating and handling complaints,” said Kaitlin Banner, a senior attorney with the Advancement Project.</p>

<p>A ProPublica analysis of data on more than 40,000 civil rights cases, obtained through multiple public records requests, bears out Banner’s point. We found that, under Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, the department has scuttled more than 1,200 civil rights investigations that were begun under the Obama administration and lasted at least six months. These cases, which investigated complaints of civil rights violations ranging from discriminatory discipline to sexual violence in school districts and colleges around the country, were closed without any findings of wrongdoing or corrective action, often due to insufficient evidence.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Hill, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education, didn’t dispute ProPublica’s data. She maintained that the Office for Civil Rights is “as committed as ever” to vigorous civil rights enforcement.</p>

<p>“Where the evidence is insufficient for OCR to prove a violation of law, or the facts show that dismissal is appropriate on other grounds, OCR closes the case, which provides much-needed closure for both students and institutions,” she said in an emailed response, adding that the Trump administration has “restored the role of OCR investigators as neutral fact-finders.”</p>

<p>ProPublica also found that the Office for Civil Rights has become more lenient. Under Obama, 51 percent of cases that took more than 180 days culminated in findings of civil rights violations, or corrective changes. Under the Trump administration, that rate has dropped to 35 percent. (We compared the first 15 months of resolved cases under Trump with the preceding 15 months under Obama, and limited our analysis to cases that took at least 180 days in an attempt to weed out those that were open-and-shut, duplicative, or didn’t require a full probe.)</p>

<p>Outcomes on specific topics reflect this pattern. For instance, 70 percent of complaints of discrimination against students with limited proficiency in the English language were upheld under Obama, compared to 52 percent under the current administration. The proportion of complaints substantiated regarding the individualized educational needs of students with disabilities has dropped from 45 percent to 34 percent; regarding sexual harassment and violence, from 41 percent to 31 percent; and regarding racial harassment, from 31 percent to 21 percent.</p>

<p>These differences reflect the contrasting approaches of the Obama and Trump administrations to civil rights enforcement, according to people familiar with both. Under Obama, the Office for Civil Rights looked into instances of discrimination against individuals, but also made it a priority to carry out more time-consuming and systemic investigations into disparate treatment of students based on race, disability, or other factors.</p>

<p>On the other hand, efficiency is the Trump administration’s priority. It has restricted the time and scope of investigations, concentrating on individual complaints that can be handled quickly, and seeking to clear a backlog of more expansive cases. As a result, it has resolved about 3,250 cases that lasted more than six months, compared to about 1,150 during the last 15 months of the Obama administration. Because of this high volume, the raw number of cases concluded with findings of wrongdoing has increased under DeVos, although the percentage is considerably lower.</p>

<p>“The extraordinary backlog of cases inherited by this Administration was greatly concerning to OCR,” said Hill. “Processing the stalled cases has been a priority, as has trying to meet our agency goal of processing new cases within 180 days.”</p>

<p>The data documents the Trump administration’s tilt away from systemic issues to complaints by individual students, said Seth Galanter, a former senior official in the Education Department’s civil rights office under Obama. “If all you see when you get a complaint is one kid and one dispute with a school, you will be able to resolve that — and maybe even in the kid’s favor — pretty quickly, but you are focusing on the needles and not the haystacks,” he said. “The way they are approaching it is they are only dealing with the squeaky wheel. They aren’t doing their full job, which means they can move quickly.”</p>

<p>Hill said such criticism was “unfounded. Under the current Administration, OCR decides whether to conduct systemic investigations based on the facts of a case, not the ideological biases of OCR’s political appointees as did the prior Administration,” she said. “OCR recognizes that many schools and colleges want to rectify civil rights problems and the end result will be greater equity for more students when OCR is willing to work with schools rather than against them.”</p>

<p>While the 12 regional bureaus under Obama often needed approval from headquarters to settle or dismiss a case, DeVos is resolving probes faster by decentralizing decision-making and giving the regions more latitude to decide outcomes, Hill said. Perhaps reflecting this policy, the proportion of investigations that found violations or required corrective action has ranged under DeVos from more than half for the New York office to about a quarter for the Philadelphia office. Hill said that OCR’s “legal standards are consistent nationally” and these variances reflect the different mix of cases that each office handles.</p>

<p>For our analysis, cases resolved through a settlement, mediation, or other involvement from OCR were counted as having corrective changes or findings of violations. If a single complaint contained multiple allegations, and one or more of the claims was substantiated, we marked the entire case docket as finding violations or resulting in corrective change. Because of gaps in the information provided to ProPublica, about 1.5 percent of OCR cases resolved under the Trump administration — most of them in a two-week period in December 2017 — are not reflected in our analysis.</p>

<p>Under federal law, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Office for Civil Rights is responsible for ensuring equal access to education and investigating allegations of discrimination in the country’s schools and colleges. Families and students can file complaints with the office, which then investigates and determines whether a college or school district may have violated federal law. If violations are substantiated, the office typically negotiates a settlement or prescribes corrective changes, which it sometimes oversees. For some complaints, the office may mediate a resolution. It receives more than 10,000 complaints annually, and has a target of resolving 80 percent of them within six months.</p>

<p>As the Obama administration tackled more complicated investigations, the cases took longer to resolve. From 2010 to 2015, time spent on the average sexual violence investigation increased from 289 to 963 days; on a school discipline case, from 198 to 451 days; and on a harassment probe, from 200 to 287 days. At the department’s request, Congress boosted the office’s budget.</p>

<p>Democratic Senators Condemn Betsy DeVos’ Record on Civil Rights</p>

<p>DeVos is rolling back this expansion. In an internal memo last June, Candice Jackson, then the head of the civil rights office, urged investigators to stop looking at complaints through a systemic lens, and dropped the requirement that all discipline and sexual violence investigations had to review three years of district or college data. A case processing manual released this past March broadened the circumstances that allow investigators to close a probe or dismiss a complaint — for example, if it is part of a serial filing (repeated complaints by one person or group about the same situation) or poses an “unreasonable” burden. DeVos also barred complainants from appealing the office’s decisions. The department intends to shrink OCR’s staff from 569 to 529, including nearly two dozen attorneys and equal opportunity specialists, according to its annual budget proposal.</p>

<p>Under DeVos, the department has scaled back a proactive type of civil rights investigation known as a compliance review. These reviews may stem from statistics, news reports or other sources, as well as from complaints by parents or students. They often explore systemic issues such as racial disparities. During the last 15 months of the Obama administration, OCR opened 13 compliance reviews, probing a variety of areas from access to rigorous curriculum to services for students with limited English proficiency. In its first 15 months, the Trump administration initiated only two compliance reviews, looking at education for students with disabilities in a juvenile correctional facility in Arizona, and use of isolation and restraints in an alternative education program based in Virginia. OCR may conduct more compliance reviews in the coming months, Hill said.</p>

<p>Since DeVos took over the education department, she has been under fire for her approach to civil rights. Earlier this month, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, alongside disability advocates, filed a lawsuit against the education department, alleging that its procedural changes are leading civil rights investigators to unlawfully dismiss complaints without a full investigation. Hill declined comment on the pending litigation.</p>

<p>The drop-off in the rate of finding violations could mean that OCR’s investigations are becoming less rigorous, said Catherine Lhamon, the former head of the civil rights office under Obama. “We want speedy justice, but you still have to thoroughly investigate each complaint.”</p>

<p>One long investigation terminated by the Trump administration took place in Bryan, Texas. As ProPublica previously reported, the Dallas bureau of the federal civil rights office spent more than four years investigating whether disciplinary practices in Bryan discriminated against students of color. Federal investigators found at least 10 incidents where black students received harsher punishment than their white peers for the same conduct.</p>

<p>Weeks before Trump’s inauguration, federal investigators and the district were on the cusp of a settlement that would have required more than a dozen reforms. But after DeVos took over, the case and the pending settlement were scuttled, with no findings of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>In late April, OCR also shelved the investigation into school discipline in DeSoto County, where 852 students — more than half of them black — received corporal punishment in 2015.</p>

<p>Shelia Riley, the chairperson of DeSoto’s school board, told ProPublica that OCR’s decision was appropriate. “I read the [parents’] claims and I just felt like we were fair in our disciplinary decisions,” she said. She added that she supports corporal punishment for misbehaving students.</p>

<p>Renee Wade, a registered nurse in DeSoto County, told ProPublica that her son, who is about to enter ninth grade, has received corporal punishment more than 10 times over the past seven years for conduct such as acting out in class. These behaviors are associated with his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, for which he has an individualized education program that doesn’t include physical beatings.</p>

<p>Even though Wade could exempt her son from being paddled under district policy, the alternative is typically suspension, which she felt wasn’t a practical option. Wade and her husband have full-time jobs and can’t care for their son if he’s home during the working day. “If the school can’t use corporal punishment, then they get suspended,” said Wade, who is African-American. “If you work, then this is not a possibility. I feel as a parent I have no other choice.”</p>

<h2 id="whendoreporterscollaborateandwhendotheycompete">When Do Reporters Collaborate, and When Do They Compete?</h2>

<p>by: David Eads</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-18</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/ask-propublica-illinois-reporters-journalism-collaboration-between-newsrooms </p>

<p>Ask ProPublica Illinois</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year, we asked ProPublica Illinois readers what they wanted to know about how we do our work. Thoughtful, challenging questions have been rolling in ever since, and we’ve been answering them in an occasional series of columns. In this dispatch, ProPublica Illinois news applications developer David Eads answers a question about whether news organizations share their reporting.</p>

<p>To what extent do journalists from various newsgathering organizations share their efforts BEFORE PUBLISHING? I know all media outlets are “friendly competitors” but the “media” are our eyes and ears and if they are chasing the same leads, they are duplicating efforts that would be better spent chasing different leads. —Mel Miller</p>

<p>Thinking about competition and collaboration in journalism conjures up images of the great newspaper rivalries. The Washington Post and The New York Times competed during the 1970s covering the Pentagon Papers, and the Post, Times and others battled over the Monica Lewinsky scandal during the Clinton administration.</p>

<p>Now, the Post and Times are at it again with story after story on the administration of President Donald Trump. In fact, in over a week-and-a-half in May 2017, the Times and the Post published a series of investigative stories that magazines called the “last great newspaper war” and the “10 best days in journalism.”</p>

<p>Among the scoops: the Times reporting that, before he was fired, FBI Director James Comey had asked for more prosecutors and other personnel for the Russia investigation, and the Post revealing that Trump had disclosed highly classified information to top Russian officials in a meeting at the White House.</p>

<p>Journalism juggernauts vying to beat each other by writing smart stories, digging up scoops and cultivating important, inside sources hasn’t abated. It’s good for journalism and it can serve readers.</p>

<p>Over the past decade or so, however, the need for collaboration has grown as well. Staffs at many legacy publications have shrunk, forcing news organizations to decide what’s essential to their mission. Not that newsrooms agree formally or informally to cede stories to competitors, but they increasingly make choices about how to allocate limited resources.</p>

<p>Some stories are so complex, or involve datasets and coverage beyond what even the largest newsrooms can reasonably tackle, that collaboration is key. In other cases, small newsrooms find that by working together they bring different strengths, skills and audiences to a story that ultimately allows it to be told in a richer way and reach different groups of people.</p>

<p>Projects like the Pulitzer Prize-winning Panama Papers, ProPublica’s own Electionland and Documenting Hate, and regional initiatives like the Ohio Valley ReSource are just a few examples of this kind of collaboration. For the Panama Papers, close to 400 reporters from roughly 100 media outlets in some 80 countries sifted through an enormous body of data to show how the rich and powerful avoid taxes and hide their financial activities without breaking the law. (Full disclosure: My wife worked on this project.)</p>

<p>Partnerships are central to the ProPublica model. Some develop intentionally, when we seek out a publishing partner. Others are more serendipitous. ProPublica and This American Life joined with The Marshall Project on 2015’s “An Unbelievable Story of Rape” after reporters discovered they were working on the same story. Instead of rushing competing stories into publication, they decided to combine their efforts.</p>

<p>The result: a Pulitzer Prize.</p>

<p>The rise of technology and open source culture — the practice of freely sharing and collaborating on software development — also has fostered collaboration across organizations and industries. Elex, a project to ease working with election data that I helped develop, started as a partnership between The New York Times and NPR and includes contributions from the Los Angeles Times, The San Diego Union-Tribune and more. It’s used by dozens of media organizations to deliver election results to their audiences.</p>

<p>Competition remains in many markets, though it can shift from day to day. In Chicago, for instance, many news outlets, including the two major newspapers, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times, vie for your attention. At the same time, they also work together. At ProPublica Illinois, we’ve collaborated with both papers, as well as other local outlets, and other media organizations have also worked together. Some recent examples: WBEZ and the Better Government Association collaborated to investigate broken elevators in public housing, City Bureau and Curious City have worked together to tackle topics like segregation in Chicago, and the Chicago Data Collaborative brings together multiple organizations from media and beyond to go deeper on criminal justice data.</p>

<p>Both competition and collaboration are important parts of the journalism ecosystem. The most important question is whether a story and its audience will benefit from competition or collaboration.</p>

<p>In the case of the great rivalry between the Post and the Times, competition can spur deeper reporting. Audiences win. In the case of giant leaks or fundamental data like election results, collaboration may create broader accountability and best serves audiences.</p>

<h2 id="dhschiefisconfrontedwithpropublicatapeofwailingchildrenseparatedfromparents">DHS Chief is Confronted With ProPublica Tape of Wailing Children Separated from Parents</h2>

<p>by: Stephen Engelberg</p>

<p>Zero Tolerance</p>

<p>Minutes after ProPublica posted a recording of crying children begging for their parents, Kirstjen Nielsen stepped up to the podium in the White House briefing room to answer questions from reporters, as well as a growing chorus of criticism from Democrats and Republicans.</p>

<p>Nielsen, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, blamed Congress for the Trump administration’s policy of separating children detained at the border from their parents. Nielsen said the administration would continue to send the children to temporary detention centers in warehouses and big box stores until Congress rewrites the nation’s immigration laws.</p>

<p>At one point, a reporter from New York magazine, Olivia Nuzzi, played the tape ProPublica obtained from inside a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility, according to tweets she posted.</p>

<p>It’s unclear if Nielsen heard the recording, which consists mostly of the sounds of weeping children calling for their mothers and fathers. Reporters attempted to ask her questions about the material in the recording — including “How is this not child abuse?” — but she did not respond directly. Asked if the recordings, along with pictures and more that have emerged in recent days, are an unintended consequence of the administration’s approach, she said, “I think that they reflect the focus of those who post such pictures and narratives.”</p>

<p>Richard Tofel, ProPublica’s president, said the decision to post the recording and accompanying story reflected a focus on providing a fuller accounting of what’s happening in facilities that are closed to public view.</p>

<p>“Our agenda is to bring the American people facts for their consideration,” he said.</p>

<p>The separation of these Central American children from their parents was triggered by the administration’s decision to bring criminal charges against adults who enter the country without permission. That move, which is discretionary, brings into play regulations that prevent parents facing criminal prosecution from being imprisoned with their children.</p>

<p>Nielsen denied that the policy change was intended to pressure Congress.</p>

<p>“The children are not being used as a pawn,” she said. “We’re trying to protect the children, which is why I’m asking Congress to act.”</p>

<p>Zero Tolerance</p>

<p>The desperate sobbing of 10 Central American children, separated from their parents one day last week by immigration authorities at the border, makes for excruciating listening. Many of them sound like they’re crying so hard, they can barely breathe. They scream “Mami” and “Papá” over and over again, as if those are the only words they know.</p>

<p>An error occurred.</p>

<p>Try watching this video on www.youtube.com, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.</p>

<p>The baritone voice of a Border Patrol agent booms above the crying. “Well, we have an orchestra here,” he jokes. “What’s missing is a conductor.”</p>

<p>Then a distraught but determined 6-year-old Salvadoran girl pleads repeatedly for someone to call her aunt. Just one call, she begs anyone who will listen. She says she’s memorized the phone number, and at one point, rattles it off to a consular representative. “My mommy says that I’ll go with my aunt,” she whimpers, “and that she’ll come to pick me up there as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>An audio recording obtained by ProPublica adds real-life sounds of suffering to a contentious policy debate that has so far been short on input from those with the most at stake: immigrant children. More than 2,300 of them have been separated from their parents since April, when the Trump administration launched its “zero tolerance” immigration policy, which calls for prosecuting all people who attempt to illegally enter the country and taking away the children they brought with them. More than 100 of those children are under the age of 4. The children are initially held in warehouses, tents or big box stores that have been converted into Border Patrol detention facilities.</p>

<p>Condemnations of the policy have been swift and sharp, including from some of the administration’s most reliable supporters. It has united religious conservatives and immigrant rights activists, who have said that “zero tolerance” amounts to “zero humanity.” Democratic and Republican members of Congress spoke out against the administration’s enforcement efforts over the weekend. Former first lady Laura Bush called the administration’s practices “cruel” and “immoral,” and likened images of immigrant children being held in kennels to those that came out of Japanese internment camps during World War II. And the American Academy of Pediatrics has said the practice of separating children from their parents can cause the children “irreparable harm.”</p>

<p>Still, the administration had stood by it. President Donald Trump blames Democrats and says his administration is only enforcing laws already on the books, although that’s not true. There are no laws that require children to be separated from their parents, or that call for criminal prosecutions of all undocumented border crossers. Those practices were established by the Trump administration.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jeff Sessions has cited passages from the Bible in an attempt to establish religious justification. On Monday, he defended it again saying it was a matter of rule of law, “We cannot and will not encourage people to bring children by giving them blanket immunity from our laws.” A Border Patrol spokesman echoed that thought in a written statement.</p>

<p>In recent days, authorities on the border have begun allowing tightly controlled tours of the facilities that are meant to put a humane face on the policy. But cameras are heavily restricted. And the children being held are not allowed to speak to journalists.</p>

<p>The audio obtained by ProPublica breaks that silence. It was recorded last week inside a U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention facility. The person who made the recording asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation. That person gave the audio to Jennifer Harbury, a well-known civil rights attorney who has lived and worked for four decades in the Rio Grande Valley along the Texas border with Mexico. Harbury provided it to ProPublica. She said the person who recorded it was a client who “heard the children’s weeping and crying, and was devastated by it.”</p>

<p>The person estimated that the children on the recording are between 4 and 10 years old. It appeared that they had been at the detention center for less than 24 hours, so their distress at having been separated from their parents was still raw. Consulate officials tried to comfort them with snacks and toys. But the children were inconsolable.</p>

<p>The child who stood out the most was the 6-year-old Salvadoran girl with a phone number stuck in her head. At the end of the audio, a consular official offers to call the girl’s aunt. ProPublica dialed the number she recited in the audio, and spoke with the aunt about the call.</p>

<p>“It was the hardest moment in my life,” she said. “Imagine getting a call from your 6-year-old niece. She’s crying and begging me to go get her. She says, ‘I promise I’ll behave, but please get me out of here. I’m all alone.’”</p>

<p>The aunt said what made the call even more painful was that there was nothing she could do. She and her 9-year-old daughter are seeking asylum in the United States after immigrating here two years ago for the exact same reasons and on the exact same route as her sister and her niece. They are from a small town called Armenia, about an hour’s drive northwest of the Salvadoran capital, but well within reach of its crippling crime waves. She said gangs were everywhere in El Salvador: “They’re on the buses. They’re in the banks. They’re in schools. They’re in the police. There’s nowhere for normal people to feel safe.”</p>

<p>She said her niece and sister set out for the United States over a month ago. They paid a smuggler $7,000 to guide them through Guatemala, and Mexico and across the border into the United States. Now, she said, all the risk and investment seem lost.</p>

<p>The aunt said she worried that any attempt to intervene in her niece’s situation would put hers and her daughter’s asylum case at risk, particularly since the Trump administration overturned asylum protections for victims of gang and domestic violence. She said she’s managed to speak to her sister, who has been moved to an immigration detention facility near Port Isabel, Texas. And she keeps in touch with her niece, Alison Jimena Valencia Madrid, by telephone. Mother and daughter, however, have not been able to speak to one another.</p>

<p>The aunt said that Alison has been moved out of the Border Patrol facility to a shelter where she has a real bed. But she said that authorities at the shelter have warned the girl that her mother, 29-year-old Cindy Madrid, might be deported without her.</p>

<p>“I know she’s not an American citizen,” the aunt said of her niece. “But she’s a human being. She’s a child. How can they treat her this way?”</p>

<p>Zero Tolerance</p>

<p>As the Trump administration continues to defend its “zero tolerance” immigration policy, which, since April, has separated more than 2,300 children from their parents at the border, ProPublica obtained an audio recording from inside a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility. The recording captured the voices of kids as young as 4, crying for “Mami” and “Papá” as if those were the only words they knew.</p>

<p>The audio intensified the bipartisan outcry to put an end to the policy. But at a White House briefing Monday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen blamed Congress, saying that until the nation’s immigration laws are rewritten, children will remain in detention centers as their parents face criminal charges for entering the country without permission, a move at the discretion of the administration.</p>

<p>Most concerning to the families being separated is what appears to be a lack of a plan to reunite the children with their parents. The little girl who can be heard crying in the video, 6-year-old Alison Jimena Valencia Madrid, had not been able to speak to her mother for days after they were separated, according to the girl’s aunt. Authorities at the shelter have warned the girl that her mother could be deported without her.</p>

<h2 id="behindthecriminalimmigrationlaweugenicsandwhitesupremacy">Behind the Criminal Immigration Law: Eugenics and White Supremacy</h2>

<p>Central American asylum-seekers are taken into custody near the U.S.-Mexico border in McAllen, Texas, in June.</p>

<p>Zero Tolerance</p>

<p>Amid a bipartisan backlash, President Trump has tried repeatedly to shift blame to Democrats for his own administration’s “zero-tolerance” immigration policy, which has resulted in more than 2,300 migrant children being taken from their families along the U.S.–Mexico border. “The Democrats have to change their law — that’s their law,” Trump told reporters on Friday.</p>

<p>The president didn’t specify which law he was talking about. But the statute at the center of his administration’s policy is the work of Republicans — with origins dating back all the way to World War I — albeit with substantial Democratic support along the way. Known originally as the “Undesirable Aliens Act,” the statute would not exist without support from, respectively, a eugenicist and a white supremacist.</p>

<p>The law in question was the foundation of a memo Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued in early April that laid out the administration’s new, zero-tolerance policy. In the memo, Sessions instructed federal prosecutors in the southwestern United States to file criminal charges against any adults caught entering the country illegally. His order stripped officials of discretion over whether to place migrant families seeking asylum into civil proceedings, which allow families to stay together. (Court rulings limit how long the government can detain migrants in civil proceedings. There’s also no guarantee they’ll return for future hearing dates once they’re let out, a phenomenon that has prompted the president’s complaints about “catch and release.”)</p>

<p>On Monday, ProPublica published audio recorded at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention facility in which a Border Patrol agent mocks the wails of migrant children as young as 4. Liberals and conservatives alike have condemned the policy, calling it “cruel,” an “atrocity,” and “inconsistent with our American values.”</p>

<p>Top Trump administration officials have held their ground. “We are enforcing the laws passed by Congress,” Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen asserted Monday. Her message echoed one Sessions had delivered to law enforcement officers in Indiana last week. “If you violate the law, you subject yourself to prosecution,” he said.</p>

<p>The federal law they say they are enforcing makes it a crime for foreign citizens to cross (or attempt to cross) the border into the U.S. anywhere other than an official port of entry. A first offense is a misdemeanor; a second unlawful entry is a felony.</p>

<p>The law’s ancestry dates back to World War I. Till that point, U.S. immigration laws had tended to be all or nothing: either no limits at all — or blanket bans for certain groups, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act. Others were free to enter provided they weren’t “lunatics,” polygamists, prostitutes, “suffering from a loathsome or a dangerous contagious disease,” or so on.</p>

<p>The result was floods of immigrants: Between 1901 and 1910, for example, close to 9 million came to the U.S. As that happened, anti-immigrant attitudes mounted, with mass influxes from parts of Europe associated in the popular imagination with a litany of social problems, like urban poverty and squalor.</p>

<p>Listen to Children Who’ve Just Been Separated From Their Parents at the Border</p>

<p>In May 1918, after the U.S. had entered World War I, Congress passed a statute called the Passport Act that gave the president the power to restrict the comings and goings of foreign citizens during wartime. A few months later, however, the war ended — and with it, the restrictions on border crossings.</p>

<p>Federal officials saw potential in the criminal provisions of the Passport Act — a maximum 20-year sentence — as a tool for deterring immigration. So prosecutors ignored the expiration of the law and continued to indict migrants under the Passport Act for unlawful entry into the U.S.</p>

<p>Anti-immigration sentiment continued to climb and the rhetoric of the era has resonance today. One anti-immigration group at the time claimed that immigrants tended to be “vicious and criminal” — the “bootleggers, gangsters, and racketeers of large cities.” The war, Columbia University historian Mae Ngai has written, “raised nationalism and anti-foreign sentiment to a high pitch.”</p>

<p>In response, Congress began clamping down. With the Immigration Act of 1924, it capped the flow at about 165,000 people a year, a small fraction of previous levels The statute’s quotas curtailed migration from southern and eastern Europe severely. Another 1924 law — the Oriental Exclusion Act — banned most immigration from Asia. At the same time, Congress made it easier to deport non-citizens for immigration violations.</p>

<p>In 1925, a federal appeals court put a halt to the practice of indicting migrants under the Passport Act outside wartime. But immigration officials liked what they’d seen, and by 1927, they were working on a replacement.</p>

<p>Two men spearheaded the effort that would lead Congress to criminalize unlawful entry into the United States. They were motivated by eugenics and white supremacy.</p>

<p>The first was James Davis, who was Secretary of Labor from 1921 to 1930. A Republican originally appointed by President Warren Harding, Davis was himself an immigrant from Wales who went by “Puddler Jim,” a reference to his job as a youthful worker in the steel mills of western Pennsylvania. At the time, the Department of Labor oversaw immigration, and Davis had grown disturbed by what he’d seen.</p>

<p>Davis was a committed eugenicist, and he believed principles of eugenics should guide immigration policy, according to The Bully Pulpit and the Melting Pot by the historian Hans Vought. It was necessary to draw a distinction, Davis had written in 1923, between “bad stock and good stock, weak blood and strong blood, sound heredity and sickly human stuff.”</p>

<p>James J. Davis, who was secretary of labor from 1921 to 1930</p>

<p>In November 1927, Davis proposed a set of immigration reforms in the pages of The New York Times. Among his goals: “the definite lessening and possibly, in time, the complete checking of the degenerate and the bearer of degenerates.” One “phase of the immigration problem,” Davis wrote, was the “surreptitious entry of aliens” into the United States in numbers that “cannot even be approximately estimated.”</p>

<p>Deportation alone wasn’t enough to deter illegal immigration, Davis wrote. There was nothing disincentivizing the migrant from turning around and trying again. “Endeavoring to stop this law violation” by deportation only, he wrote, “is like trying to prevent burglary with a penalty no severer than opening the front door of the burglarized residence, should the burglar be found within, escorting him to it, and saying ‘You have no right here; see that you don’t come in again.’”</p>

<p>An immigrant who enters the country unlawfully, he concluded, “should be treated as a law violator and punished effectively.”</p>

<p>To bring his vision to fruition, Davis teamed up with a senator from South Carolina. Coleman Livingston Blease, a Democrat, was “a proud and unreconstructed white supremacist,” UCLA history professor Kelly Lytle Hernández wrote in her 2017 book City of Inmates.</p>

<p>Migrants from Mexico were one group whose numbers the increasingly powerful nativist elements in Congress hadn’t managed to restrict. Mexican workers were key to the booming economy of the southwest. Regional employers, particularly in the agricultural sector, had successfully lobbied Congress to block any bill that would choke off their primary source of inexpensive labor. As a result, migration from Mexico soared, with many Mexicans making illegal border crossings to avoid the cost and inconvenience of customs stations.</p>

<p>Blease saw in Davis’s proposal for criminal penalties a way to advance his vision of a white America, and he believed it would bridge the gap between the nativists clamoring for quotas and southwestern congressmen resisting them. Large-scale farmers didn’t mind criminal penalties, Hernández writes, so long as the law was enforced once the harvest was over.</p>

<p>The legislation wasn’t without its opponents, as the UCLA law professor Ingrid Eagly documented in a 2010 study of immigration prosecutions. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union opposed the bill. The ACLU felt it was unfair and unlikely to deter migration. An immigrant “may be quite ignorant of this law before he starts on his journey,” the group told Congress.</p>

<p>(Library of Congress via Wikimedia Commons)</p>

<p>Despite the ACLU’s objections, a Republican-controlled Congress passed Davis and Blease’s bill in 1929. A Republican president, Herbert Hoover, signed it into law.</p>

<p>The law made it a crime to enter the United States unlawfully and, in so doing, “created the criminalization of the border,” Eagly said.</p>

<p>The statute was swiftly put to use. Between July 1929 and June 1930, according to a Department of Labor report, prosecutors brought more than 6,000 unlawful entry cases. “It is believed that it will prove an effective deterrent,” the report’s author wrote. (In his recent memo, Sessions made similar claims about the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy.)</p>

<p>But the law didn’t reduce migration. By 1933, the Labor Department concluded that its rosy outlook had been wrong. The 1929 law “does not seem to have the deterrent effect expected,” noted a Labor Department report published that year.</p>

<p>It blamed budget limitations and judges wary of meting out serious sentences if a defendant was going to be deported anyway.</p>

<p>In the 1930s, the Great Depression achieved what prosecutions and deportations had not. Immigration plunged as the labor market in the United States dried up. Prosecutions for unlawful entry dropped to about 5,000 a year, according to a 2012 examination of the law by Doug Keller in the Loyola University Chicago Law Journal.</p>

<p>A shortage of labor during World War II prompted the U.S. to reverse course and encourage migration of temporary workers from Mexico through what it called the Bracero program. (The word refers to manual laborers in Spanish.)</p>

<p>Despite the earlier lessons, federal prosecutors began to focus their attention on bringing unlawful entry cases against Mexican migrants to deter workers from going around the Bracero program. By 1951, there were 15,000 illegal entry and re-entry prosecutions a year.</p>

<p>At the same time, Congress was working to overhaul American immigration law. The effort was spearheaded by two Democrats: Sen. Patrick McCarran and Rep. Francis Walter. Both were staunch anti-Communists who saw immigration — particularly from Eastern Europe and Asia — as posing a risk that Soviet or Maoist agents would infiltrate the country.</p>

<p>Their law is best known for preserving a quota system that meant about 85 percent of immigration visas annually went to people from northern and western Europe. But it also made a crucial change in the unlawful entry law.</p>

<p>In a counterintuitive move, Congress decided to reduce the penalties for unlawful entry — to a maximum of six months in prison. (It also added a felony provision for any additional illegal entry convictions.)</p>

<p>The change wasn’t driven by compassion or a shift away from criminalizing unlawful immigration. Rather, it anticipated the creation of federal magistrate courts that would handle the cases, according to Eagly, the UCLA law professor. A defendant facing a misdemeanor charge punishable by six months or less generally doesn’t have a right to a grand jury indictment or a jury trial. Once Congress established federal magistrate courts, prosecutors could bring criminal charges against far larger numbers of defendants.</p>

<p>A Democratic-controlled Congress passed the law in 1952, but it was vetoed by President Harry Truman. His veto message decried “carrying over into this year of 1952 the isolationist limitations of our 1924 law.” Congress was unmoved and overrode his veto. (In this sense, Trump is correct that Democrats bear some responsibility for the unlawful entry law that underlies his administration’s new immigration policy.)</p>

<p>The unlawful entry statute has remained largely unchanged since 1952. In 1968, however, Congress finally passed a law establishing federal magistrate courts, allowing for a major expansion of charges under the unlawful entry law. Without the need to go through the grand jury process or deal with potential jury trials, immigration prosecutions — almost all for unlawful entry — shot up, Eagly found in her 2010 study: from 2,536 cases nationwide in 1968 to 17,858 in 1974.</p>

<p>The trend culminated in programs like Operation Streamline during the George W. Bush administration, in which magistrate judges along the border took simultaneous mass guilty pleas for unlawful entry. (An appeals court ended the practice in 2009.)</p>

<p>The use of the law hasn’t been a partisan matter. The number of such cases spiked to nearly 50,000 in the last year of the Bush administration, and it stayed in that range for most of the Obama administration, according to federal government data maintained by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. By 2016, the number had fallen to about 35,000 — still higher than all but the last year of the Bush administration.</p>

<p>But the number of unlawful entry cases fell, the TRAC data shows, during Trump’s first year in office, to 27,000. (It had begun to rise again in recent months, however, even before Sessions announced the administration’s “zero-tolerance” policy.) Convictions for immigration crimes now account for more than half of all federal criminal convictions.</p>

<h2 id="theadministrationofmayorrahmemanuelkeepsmonitoringprotesters">The Administration of Mayor Rahm Emanuel Keeps Monitoring Protesters</h2>

<p>by: Mick Dumke</p>

<p>Chicago police officers watch anti-Trump protesters in Chicago during a demonstration on Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, 2017.</p>

<p>ProPublica Illinois reporter Mick Dumke looks at the state’s political issues and personalities in this occasional column.</p>

<p>Even before thousands of demonstrators gathered in downtown Chicago to speak out against President Donald Trump’s inauguration last year, city police were watching.</p>

<p>Recently released police and city records show that officers combed through social media posts and opened a formal information-gathering investigation into the protesters.</p>

<p>Then, throughout that day — Jan. 20, 2017 — police and top aides to Mayor Rahm Emanuel closely tracked the movements of protesters, from when they boarded trains and buses in their neighborhoods and continuing through hours of rallies and marches in the Loop.</p>

<p>It was another example of how the Emanuel administration routinely tracks protesters and activist groups, according to records I’ve acquired over the last several years through the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>Now the mayor and police department may soon be able to use drones to monitor demonstrations and other public events.</p>

<p>This spring, mayoral allies in the Illinois General Assembly helped pass a measure that would allow law enforcement agencies statewide to use drones for “legitimate public safety purposes” at public gatherings, including to keep tabs on crowd movements. Each department would have to submit an annual report to the state on its drone usage, but otherwise would largely be able to create its own policies. The bill hasn’t been sent to Gov. Bruce Rauner yet.</p>

<p>Chicago’s police and political leaders have a long, troubled history of snooping on groups exercising their First Amendment rights. Police investigated demonstrators and activists under Emanuel’s predecessor, Richard M. Daley. And for decades before that, including the 20-year reign of Daley’s father, Richard J. Daley, the department’s Red Squad infiltrated dissident groups, civil rights organizations, and others seen as opponents of City Hall. The unit was dismantled in the 1970s and the department adopted new rules that were supposed to safeguard civil rights.</p>

<p>Still, the police department has opened investigations to monitor, infiltrate or conduct surveillance on protest groups at least five times since Emanuel became mayor in 2011, records show. Its previous targets included Occupy Chicago protesters, opponents of the 2012 NATO summit, Black Lives Matter activists, and Southsiders Organized for Unity and Liberation, a network of churches and neighborhood groups.</p>

<p>As events on Inauguration Day show, the Chicago Police Department and other city agencies already maintain an extensive camera, data-collection and communications network to keep tabs on protests and other public gatherings.</p>

<p>Scores of protesters gathered in front of Trump Tower in Chicago during a demonstration on Inauguration Day 2017.</p>

<p>In late 2016, two activists created a Facebook page to announce plans for an Inauguration Day protest outside Trump International Hotel and Tower in downtown Chicago. Eventually 23,000 people indicated they were interested. Hundreds commented on the event’s Facebook page.</p>

<p>From the beginning, organizers stressed that they wanted the event to be peaceful and focused on speaking out against hate. But dozens of the comments on the Facebook page came from Trump supporters who mocked supporters of Hillary Clinton and other “liberals,” often with crude language.</p>

<p>On Jan. 19, 2017, a suburban man named Jeffrey Jacobs weighed in.</p>

<p>“Good place for a bomb downstairs Wacker,” Jacobs wrote, referring to the lower level of Wacker Drive, below the spot where protesters planned to gather across the river from Trump Tower. “In one of those homeless persons tents [sic].”</p>

<p>Even a cursory look at Jacobs showed he wasn’t an anti-Trump protester. On Facebook he had “liked” pages such as the Tea Party Patriots, “Ban liberals not guns,” “Not voting for Monica Lewinsky’s ex boyfriend’s wife,” and Occupy Democrats. His post about bombing Lower Wacker also prompted reprimands from other commenters.</p>

<p>When I reached Jacobs by phone recently, he volunteered that he voted for Trump. He also told me his Facebook comment was meant to be “sarcastic” — his way of saying that demonstrations can be dangerous when they take over the streets.</p>

<p>“I consider that a riot when they come down and protest,” Jacobs said.</p>

<p>Police analysts highlighted the comment last year as they were conducting “reviews” of social media about the planned protests, according to department records. The next morning, police Commander Leo Panepinto cited it in paperwork requesting approval to open an investigation. He also wrote that other commenters, including some he described as “Black Bloc” members, discussed “civil disobedience.”</p>

<p>That, he said, raised the possibility of violence. He didn’t name these commenters.</p>

<p>Panepinto is the commanding officer at the department’s Crime Prevention and Information Center, or CPIC, where police analyze information on crimes and public events alongside officials from the FBI and the federal Department of Homeland Security.</p>

<p>“To allow for lawful demonstrations to take place and to investigate the threat and possible criminal acts that are associated with these postings,” he wrote, “analysts will review the main sites that call for gatherings and then drill down on individuals that are associated with the threats.”</p>

<p>That seemed to indicate that, as part of the investigation, police would look into the Facebook post about violence.</p>

<p>Panepinto then asked for legal approval to “monitor” the protest event page and other social media — even though his analysts had already been doing so, as he wrote in his investigation request.</p>

<p>Under the department’s rules, Chicago police are allowed to monitor, infiltrate or conduct surveillance on protesters and political groups — in what they call “Investigations Directed at First Amendment-Related Information” — if they can establish a “reasonable law enforcement purpose” for doing so. But the approval doesn’t come from anyone on the outside; the department’s lawyers make the call.</p>

<p>In this case, the lawyers signed off on the investigation, and police continued to go through protesters’ social media.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, both the department and the city’s Office of Emergency Management and Communications tracked protesters in real time. The information was then shared with top mayoral aides.</p>

<p>Shortly after 11 a.m. on Inauguration Day, for example, Anthony Pascente, the city’s deputy chief operating officer, emailed a protest update to then-Deputy Mayor Andrea Zopp, chief of staff Joe Deal, mayoral spokesman Adam Collins and other city officials. Pascente informed the group that students from Juarez High School in Pilsen were planning to attend a protest in the Loop that afternoon. He and police officials also sent updates about groups headed downtown from Pilsen and the Near North Side.</p>

<p>Two hours later, a dispatch from CPIC informed Emanuel aides and other police officials that the Juarez students were on their way.</p>

<p>Just before 3 p.m., CPIC issued another bulletin noting that students and other protesters had assembled in the Loop, and more were coming: “Approximately 35 people have boarded the Red Line and are heading to Daley Plaza.”</p>

<p>Over the next eight hours, police and other city officials kept tabs on crowds that grew to thousands of protesters as they took trains and buses downtown, gathered near Trump Tower and eventually split off into several marches. One group shut down sections of Lake Shore Drive.</p>

<p>Along the way, police arrested 16 people for misdemeanor offenses such as waving flares, obstructing traffic and running into police officers on bikes. None resulted in a conviction, though one case is pending.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, Panepinto filled out paperwork to close his inquiry into the protests. He noted the arrests but offered no additional details of what investigators had done.</p>

<p>But Jacobs — whose bomb comment was used as a reason for the investigation — told me he was never contacted by the police or any other law enforcement agency.</p>

<p>That’s because police concluded the comment wasn’t “credible,” department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote me in an email. Guglielmi said police received a tip about Jacobs’ post and then opened their investigation — which is a different account than the one Panepinto offered in his paperwork.</p>

<p>“The Department reviewed the tip and vetted the information,” Guglielmi wrote. “It was determined that it was not credible and there was no further need to question the poster.”</p>

<p>Both Guglielmi and a statement from the mayor’s office said city departments team up to ensure public safety while protecting citizens’ First Amendment rights.</p>

<p>Drones would simply enhance those efforts, they said, by adding to their camera network while costing less than using helicopters, which police are already able to do.</p>

<p>“The proposed changes to the Drone Act strengthen the transparency requirements set forth under current law,” Guglielmi wrote, pointing to its annual reporting mandate.</p>

<p>But many questions remain.</p>

<p>Officials in Chicago and beyond are expanding their abilities to watch people in the name of public safety, but the public has little ability to watch them back.</p>

<h2 id="howracialprofilinggoesuncheckedinimmigrationenforcement">How Racial Profiling Goes Unchecked in Immigration Enforcement</h2>

<p>by: Kavitha Surana</p>

<p>date: 2018-06-07</p>

<p>The United States Custom House in Philadelphia, which currently houses federal offices for U.S Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Homeland Security, and other agencies (Tom Gralish/Philadelphia Inquirer) </p>

<p>No Sanctuary</p>

<p>This story was co-published with the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>

<p>When immigration officers raided a rural Pennsylvania poultry transport company early last year, a lawyer for five undocumented men arrested saw plenty of evidence their rights had been violated.</p>

<p>The Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had no warrant to drive past the company’s “No Trespassing” signs and block the exits with their vans, or to demand documentation on the workers’ legal status. According to witnesses, the officers seemed to target workers solely based on their ethnicity: They lined up Latinos for questioning and asked white employees to lead them to more Latino workers.</p>

<p>In a ruling last month, a Philadelphia immigration judge, John Carle, found there was a strong argument that the ICE officers had “egregiously violated” the Constitution. He noted that the agency presented no evidence to counter allegations of racial profiling.</p>

<p>If the case had played out in criminal court, such a finding might well have resulted in the men going free.</p>

<p>In immigration courts, however, there’s a higher bar, both for proving officers violated defendants’ rights and for getting cases thrown out as a result. Even when immigrants manage to meet this standard, they can get deported anyway.</p>

<p>The system is backed up by decades-old court rulings that consider undocumented immigrants to be in continuous violation of the law, regardless of how they are arrested, and that give officers extra latitude to factor in their targets’ physical appearance when making immigration arrests.</p>

<p>“Even if you were to suppress the evidence because you didn’t have proper consent … that doesn’t matter,” said Claude Arnold, a former ICE special agent. “The fact remains that the person is here illegally.”</p>

<p>ICE says its agents are forbidden from racial profiling, and are refreshed on training every six months.</p>

<p>But advocates for immigrants and some judges say that the logic governing immigration rulings only emboldens officers to trample over constitutional rights.</p>

<p>“It gives a huge incentive to do intentionally illegal searches, because they have a huge way to take advantage of it,” said Rex Chen, an attorney at Safe Passages Project.</p>

<p>In the case involving the Lancaster County poultry workers, the racial-profiling argument has done little to derail ICE’s deportation efforts.</p>

<p>After arresting the workers, ICE officials looked them up in a database and found that four of them had overstayed their visas. Since this information did not stem from their arrests, but was obtained separately, Carle decided their deportation cases could proceed.</p>

<p>“All they did instead was basically almost say, ‘Nanny-nanny, boo-boo, we got you anyway,’” said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Justice Center who has worked on similar cases. “Like, so what if we violated constitutional rights? We have this other piece of evidence, and that’s it, you’re done for.”</p>

<p>It’s Harder for Immigrants to Prove an Unlawful Search</p>

<p>Unlike criminal defendants, immigrants must demonstrate not only that officers acted unconstitutionally, but that their violations were egregious, or represented a widespread pattern, when filing a motion to suppress evidence as the poultry workers did.</p>

<p>This higher bar dates back to Supreme Court guidance from 1984, when the court concluded that allowing motions to suppress in deportation cases would compel courts to release people who would then “immediately resume their commission of a crime through their continuing, unlawful presence in this country.”</p>

<p>At the time, almost all of those arrested for immigration violations agreed to leave the country without a formal hearing, the justices wrote, so challenges to the legality of immigration officers’ actions virtually never came up and wouldn’t deter them.</p>

<p>The justices also trusted that the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, the precursor to ICE, had “its own comprehensive scheme for deterring Fourth Amendment violations by its agents.”</p>

<p>Its conclusions “might change,” the justices wrote, “if there developed good reason to believe that Fourth Amendment violations by INS officers were widespread.”</p>

<p>A lot has changed since then. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, immigration enforcement moved under the Department of Homeland Security and greatly widened in scope. Now, most immigrants choose to fight their deportations, as the mammoth 680,000-plus case backlog can attest.</p>

<p>Accusations of racial profiling abound — committed by cops on highways, Border Patrol agents on buses and ICE on neighborhood streets — though motions to suppress are still rare and filed by the most aggressive lawyers.</p>

<p>Few cases will have enough evidence to prove an egregious violation.</p>

<p>“The best indicators of racial profiling are comments,” said Sandoval-Moshenberg. “We have one case in which the ICE agent said, ‘Hey, are any other Spanish families living on the block?’ … Otherwise, it’s very difficult to prove racial profiling. The officer always has some other reason on why he stopped your client and no one else.”</p>

<p>One of those reasons could legitimately be “Mexican appearance,” thanks to another Supreme Court ruling.</p>

<p>In that 1975 case, a U.S. citizen of Puerto Rican descent was stopped by Border Patrol agents. Two undocumented people were passengers in the car. The agents said their only reason for the stop was that the car’s occupants looked Mexican.</p>

<p>The court found that “Mexican appearance” alone could not justify an immigration stop, but ruled that a list of examples, used together, could. They included: “characteristic appearance of persons who live in Mexico, relying on such factors as the mode of dress and haircut”; “facts in light of [the officer’s] experience in detecting illegal entry and smuggling”; “driver’s behavior,” such as “erratic driving” or “obvious attempts to evade officers”; and “characteristics of the area in which they encounter a vehicle.”</p>

<p>“All those give an awful lot of discretion to rely on race,” said Kevin R. Johnson, a law professor at University of California-Davis. “Even if they say, ‘Well, he’s wearing working clothes’ or ‘He’s wearing clothes typical of an immigrant from Mexico,’ or something like that, there’s an awful lot of leeway there.”</p>

<p>When confronted with public outcry about profiling, ICE and the Border Patrol usually respond that agents used “a multitude of indicators that, when put together, raise a reasonable suspicion of illegal alienage.”</p>

<p>In Pennsylvania, It’s Open Season on Undocumented Immigrants</p>

<p>For example, in an Oregon case caught on video by a legal observer for the ACLU of Oregon last year, Isidro Andrade-Taffolla, a U.S. citizen, alleged racial profiling after he was questioned as he left a county courthouse. ICE officers in plainclothes had approached him with a picture of another man and asked for his identification, but Andrade-Taffolla said the picture looked nothing like him except for his skin color.</p>

<p>ICE officials said the questioning was in line with their policies. “Physical appearance wasn’t the only thing in common between the person questioned and the actual target,” Matthew Bourke, a spokesman for ICE, told ProPublica. “ICE officers had information that the target would be at the courthouse, and that — combined with a similar physical match — was why ICE officers asked for identification.”</p>

<p>Peter Schuck, a Yale law professor, argues that some reliance on profiling may be necessary for officers to act quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>“It’s hard to see how immigration enforcement could occur without some kind of stereotyping and generalization,” he said. “It stands to reason that they don’t know much about the people they are seeking, so they have to rely on inferences, and those inferences are generally supported by some stereotypes.”</p>

<p>Arnold, the former ICE agent, said officers use observations about a person’s “manner and demeanor” to assess whether they could be here illegally. According to him, these can include noticing when people speak only Spanish or appear nervous when encountered by an immigration officer.</p>

<p>“Maybe a bunch of people are running,” he said. “Maybe the five white employees are just standing there; they aren’t running. It has nothing to do with their skin color, but I know clearly they are not afraid of ICE. … That is an indicator to me that they might be legal.”</p>

<p>Proving Profiling May Not Be Enough to Get an Arrest Tossed</p>

<p>ProPublica and the Philadelphia Inquirer reported on the Lancaster County poultry workers’ arrest in a series this spring about ICE’s aggressive enforcement in Pennsylvania, an effort not completely supported by local communities.</p>

<p>Luke Brubaker, a prominent dairy farmer, mentioned the workers’ arrest in a meeting between President Trump and agriculture-industry representatives. Brubaker said he told the president that ICE had been arresting essential workers in Pennsylvania agriculture.</p>

<p>According to the workers’ motion to suppress evidence, filed in October, ICE officers came onto the property on April 5, 2017, with a photo of a man they were looking for. His name was “Alix,” and he worked for a company called MainJoy Unlimited.</p>

<p>Workers told them they were at the wrong company, and nobody with that name worked there. But agents immediately moved to ask for the documents of the workers who did.</p>

<p>“They were totally taking advantage of the language barrier and the fact that these guys didn’t know they had any rights,” Nichole Carpenter, the company’s human resources manager, told a reporter. “The three mechanics in the mechanic’s bay — white guys in their 50s — just continued to work like nothing was going on.”</p>

<p>Under duress, the Latino poultry workers admitted to being undocumented.</p>

<p>ICE used those admissions, and the workers’ lack of documentation at the time of the arrest, to try to get them deported. The men asked the judge to prohibit ICE from using that evidence, arguing they were intimidated and coercively interrogated because of their race.</p>

<p>They added, in the motion, that an officer physically forced one of them to sign papers and get fingerprinted. They also said an officer told them they had come to the United States to “take his jobs and invade his country.”</p>

<p>Luke Brubaker, 76, takes issue with calling workers on his family's Mount Joy dairy farm "immigrant workers." He insists they are "essential workers."</p>

<p>In December, ICE voluntarily withdrew the evidence gathered from the arrests of four of the men, saying it had found independent proof in a database that they were in the country illegally because they’d overstayed short-term visas.</p>

<p>The Philadelphia judge made his preliminary ruling on the motion to suppress only for the one man without a trail in the database. ICE had no record of him, presumably because he entered the country illegally. The ICE officer who ran his background check had simply written “no criminal history” and, crucially, “no migration history” on his intake form.</p>

<p>In court documents, ICE called the interrogation “consensual.” But the judge found that there was enough evidence to suggest ICE officers had detained him because he was “Latino-looking.” He ruled that ICE would have to prove otherwise or drop its case. If ICE decides to fight the allegations, it will do so at a hearing in October.</p>

<p>The judge allowed deportation proceedings to go forward against the four workers in the database. The men are out of custody, on bond, and plan to appeal Carle’s decision.</p>

<p>“It’s a weird situation,” said Andy Mahon, the lawyer for the workers. “Because they did things the ‘right way,’” — entered the country legally — “they are in a worse position than someone who didn’t, because now that evidence is being used against them.”</p>

<p>The agency declined to comment on the case, other than to say: “ICE’s enforcement actions are targeted and lead driven. ICE does not conduct sweeps or raids that target aliens indiscriminately.”</p>

<p>Arnold said that even if an immigrant proves an ICE officer searched him without cause or consent, it still doesn’t negate being here illegally. “The court can’t remedy that and say, ‘OK, yeah, we’ll make that person legal.’ How do they do that? The court does not have the authority,” he said.</p>

<p>Over the years, some judges have questioned the Supreme Court’s reasoning, seeing outcomes like this as encouragement for ICE officers to overstep in their operations, in hopes that they’ll be able to net enough deportable people.</p>

<p>In August 2017, the 9th Circuit in California reviewed the case of Luis Enrique Sanchez, a 45-year-old undocumented immigrant who had lived for almost three decades in California. A small boat owner, he took his friends out for a ride off Channel Islands Harbor, within territorial waters. When his boat’s engine lost power, he called the Coast Guard for help. The Coast Guard rescued the group — then immediately detained and frisked Sanchez and his friends and reported them to ICE.</p>

<p>When Sanchez filed a motion to suppress, ICE also found him in a database that showed his legal status had lapsed.</p>

<p>Unlike Judge Carle, the 9th Circuit ruled that his deportation case should be dropped. Doing otherwise “allows immigration and other law enforcement agencies to prey on migrant and working-class communities. Law enforcement officers can unconstitutionally round up migrant-looking individuals, elicit their names, and then search through government databases to discover incriminating information in preexisting immigration records,” one judge wrote.</p>

<p>While lower courts have issued conflicting rulings, the Supreme Court hasn’t weighed in to clarify since the 1980s, leaving the issue unsettled until the court decides to intervene again.</p>

<p>It’s Impossible to Tell When or if Officers Get Disciplined</p>

<p>ICE and Border Patrol say they investigate complaints of rights violations, including profiling, but it’s unclear what this amounts to.</p>

<p>Both agencies declined to release numbers on how many officers, if any, had been disciplined for racial profiling in recent years.</p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General, which looks into complaints about immigration agencies, has never issued a report on racial profiling. Complaints and internal investigations are never aired in public.</p>

<p>Arnold said ICE officers are deterred from making illegal searches by the threat of lawsuits. But advocates say the system is set up to make officers feel as if they won’t face consequences for inappropriate behavior.</p>

<p>The lawyer for the poultry workers said he has not filed a complaint about the officers’ behavior. Like many immigration lawyers, his priority is to keep the workers in the country. He doesn’t see any benefit for his clients in complaining to the department.</p>

<p>“There’s next to no accountability, “ said Sandoval-Moshenberg, who has made the same decision in similar cases. “Our perception of their internal complaint mechanism is that it’s totally broken and ineffective.”</p>

<p>by: Leora Smith</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-30</p>

<p>url: https://features.propublica.org/blood-spatter/blood-spatter-criminal-justice-courts-forensic-evidence/ </p>

<p>The modern era of bloodstain-pattern analysis began when a small group of scientists and forensic investigators started testifying in cases, as experts in a new technique. Some of them went on to train hundreds of police officers, investigators and crime-lab technicians — many of whom began to testify as well. When defendants appealed the legitimacy of the experts’ testimony, the cases made their way to state appeals courts. Once one court ruled such testimony admissible, other states’ courts followed suit, often citing their predecessors’ decisions. When discussing the reliability or accuracy of the technique, judges typically relied on their own — or the testifying expert’s own — assessment. Rarely, if ever, have courts required objective proof of bloodstain-pattern analysis’ accuracy.</p>

<p>Sam Sheppard, an Ohio doctor, is convicted of murdering his wife in a case that attracts widespread attention. Paul Leland Kirk, a renowned scientist and criminalist who worked on the Manhattan Project, studies the bloodstains in the Sheppard home and, the following year, offers an interpretation of events that the defense believes exonerates Sheppard.</p>

<p>People v. Carter</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of California affirms that bloodstain-pattern analysis is a proper area for expert testimony and that Kirk is a qualified expert in the field. The case is possibly the earliest instance of an appellate court explicitly accepting bloodstain-pattern analysis as an appropriate field of expertise.</p>

<p>Testifying for the prosecution, Kirk said that if the blood on the defendant’s clothing was spattered at the time of the murder, then whoever was wearing the clothes was within two-and-a-half feet of the victim. Kirk told the jury he had performed experiments to learn about blood dynamics, including beating a contraption made of wood, “sponge rubber” and a thin sheet of plastic to learn which actions create different sizes and shapes of blood spots. California Supreme Court Justice Jesse W. Carter dissented in part from the majority’s opinion, writing: “It most certainly cannot be said that an object made of wood, sponge rubber and a plastic sheet constituted the same thing as a human head.”</p>

<p>Sam Sheppard is retried, and Kirk’s findings play a central role in Sheppard’s defense. Sheppard is found not guilty.</p>

<p>Pedersen v. State</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Alaska holds that bloodstain-pattern analysis is an acceptable area for expert testimony. An Alaska State Police officer uses blood spatters on a crab-fishing ship to determine where the victim was standing when shot.</p>

<p>The court notes that trial judges have discretion regarding the admission of experts, and a decision to admit an expert should only be overturned on appeal if it is so far outside the reasonable range of decisions that it constitutes an abuse of discretion. This deferential standard is commonly used by appellate courts on the issue of expert witnesses.</p>

<p>The United States Department of Justice publishes a report, “Flight Characteristics and Stain Patterns of Human Blood,” by Herbert L. MacDonell, an instructor at a two-year college in New York with a master’s degree. It becomes a foundational text in the field of bloodstain-pattern analysis.</p>

<p>MacDonell teaches his first Bloodstain Institute, a weeklong workshop, in Jackson, Miss., training police officers as bloodstain-pattern analysts. Months later, he teaches a second institute in Elmira, N.Y. Over the next few decades, MacDonell will train more than 1,000 new analysts.</p>

<p>Compton v. Commonwealth</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Virginia rules that bloodstain-pattern analysis is a proper area for expert testimony. A Danville police officer testifies that bloodless circles on the floor helped determine that the victim was probably sitting at a table when shot.</p>

<p>People v. Erickson</p>

<p>An Illinois appellate court upholds a man’s conviction for murdering his wife. MacDonell testifies that blood patterns on the defendant’s clothes suggest that his wife’s blood spattered on him while he attacked her. On appeal, the court doesn’t rule on the issue of admissibility of experts in bloodstain-pattern analysis, because the defendant did not specifically appeal MacDonell’s admission as an expert.</p>

<p>The case does not set bloodstain-pattern-analysis precedent in Illinois, but it is later cited by courts in Michigan and Texas to support the admission of experts in the field.</p>

<p>State v. Hall</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Iowa affirms the admission of bloodstain-pattern evidence and the admission of MacDonell as an expert. The court refers to MacDonell’s field as “relatively uncomplicated” and, as a result, does not require extensive proof of its reliability. The judges write, “The evidence offered to show the reliability of the bloodstain analysis included: (1) Professor MacDonell’s considerable experience and his status as the leading expert in the field; (2) the existence of national training programs; (3) the existence of national and state organizations for experts in the field; (4) the offering of courses on the subject in several major schools; (5) use by police departments throughout the country in their day-to-day operations; (6) the holding of annual seminars; and (7) the existence of specialized publications.” The court does not acknowledge that MacDonell himself is the source of almost all these indicators of reliability.</p>

<p>One skeptical judge, Mark McCormick, wrote that he was unable to agree “that reliability of a novel scientific technique can be established solely on the basis of the success of its leading proponent in peddling his wares to consumers.” But McCormick ultimately agreed to admit MacDonell, citing his technique’s grounding in “principles of physics.”</p>

<p>State v. Hilton</p>

<p>The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine discusses the testimony of an expert in bloodstain-pattern analysis but does not actually rule on the issue of admissibility of such testimony.</p>

<p>The case does not set precedent in Maine, but it is later cited by courts in Idaho and Texas to support the admission of experts in bloodstain-pattern analysis.</p>

<p>State v. Melson</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Tennessee affirms a man’s murder conviction and death sentence and finds that bloodstain-pattern-analysis testimony of MacDonell was properly admitted.</p>

<p>The court cites the size and established nature of MacDonell’s field, noting he has trained over 300 people and rejects the defense’s argument that MacDonell’s testimony should have been excluded because, among other reasons, his experiments were not conducted on humans. The court quoted MacDonell’s own testimony from trial. “In physics it makes very little difference as to what the origin of the blood is—whether it is polyurethane soaked with blood or it is a human hand—it really doesn’t matter. You transfer energy to blood hydrostatically and you get an eruption of blood spatters.”</p>

<p>MacDonell holds his first Advanced Bloodstain Institute. Twenty-two graduates of the advanced class go on to form the International Association of Bloodstain Pattern Analysts, and Tom Bevel, an Oklahoma police officer and former student of MacDonell’s, becomes its first president.</p>

<p>Farris v. State</p>

<p>The Court of Criminal Appeals of Oklahoma rules that bloodstain-pattern analysis is a proper area for expert testimony. In a murder case under review, Bevel had testified that the bloodstains showed that the defendant struck the victim multiple times after shooting him and that the victim tried to defend himself.</p>

<p>People v. Knox</p>

<p>An appellate court in Illinois accepts bloodstain-pattern analysis as a proper area of expertise and holds that a police officer who takes a three-week course with MacDonell is qualified to testify as an expert.</p>

<p>The court finds that a deep knowledge of physics is not required for bloodstain-pattern analysis, calling the technique “essentially one of pattern recognition and reconstruction.” Justice Allan L. Stouder dissents, writing that he doesn’t believe “3 weeks training” qualified the police officer as an expert and that “the study of blood flight characteristics is based upon the laws of physics.”</p>

<p>Jordan v. State</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Mississippi holds that even if a court erred in admitting a bloodstain-pattern analyst, the testimony was not influential enough to merit a retrial. The expert in the case attended a one-week institute with MacDonell in 1973, the first year the course was offered.</p>

<p>Lewis v. State</p>

<p>An appellate court in Texas affirms the reliability of bloodstain-pattern analysis and MacDonell’s qualification to testify as an expert witness.</p>

<p>Fox v. State</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Indiana upholds a conviction and finds that the expert in bloodstain-pattern analysis who testified in a murder case is qualified because he met Indiana’s requirements for expert witnesses: His knowledge exceeded that of an “average layperson,” and he had sufficient knowledge and skill to aid the judge and jury at trial. The detective who testified had attended one course on bloodstain-pattern analysis in 1980 and had never testified about such evidence before.</p>

<p>Sets precedent in Indiana.</p>

<p>State v. Moore</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Minnesota rules that bloodstain-pattern analysis is a proper area for expert testimony and that a serology expert who has never taken a course on bloodstain-pattern analysis is qualified enough to testify as an expert.</p>

<p>State v. Rodgers</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of Idaho decides that bloodstain-pattern analysis is an appropriate area for expert testimony. The two experts in the case had trained with MacDonell and Bevel. The court affirms the men’s admission as experts, saying they each meet Idaho’s legal standard, which requires only that experts be more knowledgeable on a topic than an average juror.</p>

<p>The lone dissenting judge, Stephen Bistline, wrote that “The danger presented by expert testimony interpreting blood spatter evidence is that the prosecution is provided with an expert who appears to be able to reconstruct precisely what happened by looking at the blood left at the scene of a crime. However, a quick review of the ‘science’ relied upon by the expert suggests that we would be better off proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt without the help of such experts.”</p>

<p>State v. Goode</p>

<p>The Supreme Court of North Carolina rules that bloodstain-pattern analysis is admissible as expert testimony and upholds the death sentence for a defendant convicted of two counts of first-degree murder. The expert, Duane Deaver, worked in forensics for the State Bureau of Investigation and had studied bloodstain-pattern analysis with former students of MacDonell and Kirk. Deaver testified that the defendant, who appeared to have no blood on his clothes, actually had minuscule blood spots on his boots.</p>

<p>Sets precedent in North Carolina, citing cases in Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Virginia.</p>

<p>People v. Haywood</p>

<p>The Michigan Court of Appeals affirms the admission of bloodstain-pattern-analysis testimony and holds, among other reasons, that because bloodstain-pattern analysis is not a novel technique, extensive proof of its reliability is not required.</p>

<p>State v. Halake</p>

<p>The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals overturns a conviction of first-degree murder, finding that a police officer who had never attended a full course in bloodstain-pattern analysis was improperly admitted as an expert at trial. The court contrasts the officer’s credentials with experts admitted by other courts, including MacDonell.</p>

<p>Holmes v. State</p>

<p>The Texas Court of Appeals holds that a detective who attended one weeklong bloodstain-pattern analysis institute is sufficiently qualified to testify as an expert witness and upholds Texas’ longstanding acceptance of bloodstain-pattern analysis as a reliable technique fit for expert testimony.</p>

<p>In affirming the reliability of bloodstain-pattern analysis, the court writes: “Have any courts held blood spatter analysis to be invalid? The short answer is no.”</p>

<p>Sets precedent in Texas, citing cases from 15 other states.</p>

<p>A groundbreaking National Academy of Sciences study finds serious deficiencies in the field of forensic science in the United States and notes that “the uncertainties associated with bloodstain-pattern analysis are enormous.” The authors note that “in general, the opinions of bloodstain-pattern analysts are more subjective than scientific.”</p>

<p>A federal court finds that Duane Deaver, who testified as a bloodstain analyst in the 1995 North Carolina case State v. Goode, had performed inadequate testing. An audit of the state forensics lab where he worked will find the next year that Deaver provided misleading information on his reports for years. By the time these findings are public, judges in Tennessee and Texas will have already have cited State v. Goode in deciding to admit bloodstain-pattern analysis as a reliable field.</p>

<p>MacDonell runs his 76th, and last, institute.</p>

<p>In January, the Texas Forensic Science Commission holds a one-day hearing, prompted in part by its investigation into the role that a minimally trained bloodstain-pattern analyst played in the convictions of Joe Bryan. In February, the commission decides to create an accreditation requirement for bloodstain-pattern-analysis experts in Texas.</p>

<p>by: Vignesh Ramachandran</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-17</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/illinois-freedom-of-information-act-discussion-free-spirit-media-real-chi </p>

<p>Editors and reporters from learning newsroom Real Chi focus on covering Chicago’s West Side.</p>

<p>This week, we got together with young reporters and editors from Real Chi — a learning newsroom that covers Chicago’s West Side — to discuss Illinois’ Freedom of Information Act, or FOIA, and answer questions about how their team could use public records to inform their reporting.</p>

<p>We’ve already filed a few thousand public records requests across our Illinois newsroom. Public records have played a role in almost all of our stories — including reporter Jodi S. Cohen’s recent piece about medical research misconduct at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where documents revealed how negligence and noncompliance put children at risk. Since Real Chi’s reporting covers a specific part of the city, we enjoyed the opportunity to talk about public records on a hyperlocal scale.</p>

<p>Here are some tips based on our conversation with Real Chi:</p>

<pre><code>•   First, the information might already be out there: You may not need a FOIA at all. Some records are already ripe for picking on city/county/state websites or data portals (here is Illinois’ portal). In Real Chi’s case, published datasets such as landlord complaints, local business licenses or 311 data might be particularly relevant to their beat coverage. But if it’s not already accessible, check out data reporter Sandhya Kambhampati’s tip sheet on how you can directly ask for information.

•   Pick from the buffet of records: Many public agencies are required to keep what they call record retention schedules. That means you could ask for this list of all data an agency collects and then specify exactly what you need in your request.

•   Call, don’t just write: While it’s best to file a written request — either digitally or by snail mail — immediately follow up with a phone call. Email is too easy to ignore. Your voice (or showing up in person) isn’t. Being persistent — or some would say annoying — often pays off.

•   Keep a paper trail: Keep a record log of your requests — the dates you send your inquiries, when you follow up, your back-and-forth conversations and who you talk to. A paper trail could come in handy if you ever are denied and want to file an appeal with the public access counselor at the Illinois Attorney General’s Office.

•   Persist and be curious: If a number in a report, unexplained detail in a story or a tidbit someone says to you stands out, it’s likely worth digging. Reporter Jason Grotto characterizes persistence with a “pain-to-payoff ratio,” how much effort it takes versus what you’ll get.
</code></pre>

<p>Like Real Chi and us, you, too, can request public records about what government is doing in your community — if that’s getting the new development permit for the lot down the street, finding out whether your representatives are paying their taxes or digging into what your local schools are spending money on.</p>

<p>Because we have to demand transparency to get it.</p>

<p>Our active use of Illinois FOIA and our scrutiny of its enforcement is just beginning. If you’ve got something to say about the FOIA experiences in your life, email us at illinois@propublica.org.</p>

<h2 id="haspelspiesandvideotapes">Haspel, Spies and Videotapes</h2>

<p>by: Tim Golden</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-09</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/haspel-spies-and-videotape </p>

<p>Gina Haspel arrives for a meeting in the Hart Senate Office Building on Monday, May 7, 2018.</p>

<p>In November 2005, the CIA’s chief of undercover operations, Jose Rodriguez, turned to his closest aide for help in a crisis. Congress was threatening an investigation into the agency’s secret prisons overseas, and The Washington Post had just published new details of the so-called black sites on its front page. Rodriguez feared that the furor could pry loose videotapes that showed CIA officers brutally interrogating two terror suspects.</p>

<p>Rodriguez’s chief of staff, Gina Haspel, had directed the waterboarding of one suspect herself. Both Rodriguez and Haspel had been lobbying for years for permission to destroy the tapes, only to have the CIA’s requests rejected again and again by senior Bush administration officials.</p>

<p>Now, however, Rodriguez was determined to go ahead anyway. The tapes were locked in a CIA safe halfway across the world, but Rodriguez was not alone in thinking they were a ticking bomb that could threaten some of the interrogators and devastate the agency’s reputation.</p>

<p>“She — like everyone else around me — wanted the tapes destroyed,” Rodriguez said of Haspel in an interview. “It was something where we expected our agency to protect its people and do the right thing.”</p>

<p>As Haspel goes before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday as President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the CIA, her role in the tapes affair remains a central focus of controversy in a career that also included her supervision of a terror suspect’s interrogation using methods now widely seen as torture.</p>

<p>Although Rodriguez and Haspel were the primary subjects of a federal investigation into the destruction of the videotapes, prosecutors did not charge them with any crime. A subsequent disciplinary review by the CIA’s then-deputy director, Michael Morell, also found “no fault” with Haspel in the matter, saying she “acted appropriately.”</p>

<p>But a close examination of Haspel’s involvement in the episode, drawn from interviews and declassified documents, raises new questions about her actions and about the account of the episode she provided to federal investigators.</p>

<p>In a statement on Tuesday, the CIA acknowledged that Haspel wrote the cable that Rodriguez had sent ordering the destruction of the tapes. She did so, the agency said, in the mistaken belief that Rodriguez was actually planning to use the draft cable to “raise the issue” of destroying the tapes with Porter Goss, the CIA director. She only learned that Rodriguez had acted unilaterally after the fact, when she asked him whether Goss had approved the action and was told he had not.</p>

<p>In an interview with ProPublica several weeks ago, Rodriguez told the story differently. He said he was propelled into action after coming to the conclusion that neither Goss nor other senior administration officials would ever authorize the tapes’ destruction. He said he told Haspel that he was fed up with what he considered their political cowardice.</p>

<p>A Prisoner in Gina Haspel’s Black Site</p>

<p>Rodriguez said he told Haspel directly that he was going to take matters into his own hands, and that she responded by saying she was worried about the consequences that he might face for such a brash act.</p>

<p>“She was concerned that I was taking this risk on my own — that I was putting myself in this situation,” Rodriguez recalled. “She didn’t say, ‘Don’t do it.’ She may have thought I was going to talk to more people about it before hitting ‘send,’ but I had made up my mind that I was going to follow through.”</p>

<p>To date, no document has surfaced that might resolve the contradiction. Rodriguez was already retired when Morell began his review, which ended with a letter of reprimand for his unilateral action. The review imposed no sanctions on Haspel, accepting what it described as her “claim” that she believed her boss would not release the cable ordering the tapes’ destruction without the approval of Goss.</p>

<p>The many former CIA officials who have championed Haspel’s candidacy describe her as a talented and experienced professional whose loyalty to the agency — and especially to the undercover officers who worked with her in its clandestine service — is paramount.</p>

<p>That loyalty to the institution, some of those former officials said, would make her a careful guardian of the agency under a president who has often suggested that he wants to use the covert powers of the national security apparatus aggressively.</p>

<p>But the protective instincts that guided both Haspel and others in the tapes episode have been sharply questioned by some Senate Democrats, who have sought a fuller account of the saga, including the full report of the special prosecutor who investigated the case.</p>

<p>Compared to Haspel’s still classified activities as an officer in the CIA’s Directorate of Operations, her part in the destruction of the videotapes is almost an open book. But it is a book with substantial redactions.</p>

<p>What has become clearer from interviews and partially declassified agency documents is that Haspel became involved in the issue almost from the start of the long campaign by Rodriguez and others to have the tapes destroyed.</p>

<p>The origins of the taping remain somewhat mysterious. But, as a team of CIA officers prepared to question their first high-value prisoner at a secret prison in Thailand in the summer of 2002, officials of the agency’s Counterterrorism Center — it isn’t clear who — thought it would be wise to create a video record of the prisoner’s treatment.</p>

<p>The detainee, Zayn al-Abidin Muhammed Hussein, known by his nom de guerre, Abu Zubaydah, had been shot in the groin during his capture in Pakistan a few months earlier. CIA officials thought the tapes would be a useful backup to their written record of the interrogations. The video recordings might also insure his captors against any allegations of mistreatment if he died in their custody.</p>

<p>But officials at the CTC, as the center is known, soon had second thoughts.</p>

<p>A senior CIA lawyer, John Rizzo, said that Rodriguez first came to him about destroying the tapes in mid-October of 2002. Zubaydah was still being questioned by CIA officers in Thailand. The “aggressive” phase of his interrogation was over, but among the roughly 100 hours of videotape that had been compiled, about 12 hours showed uncensored scenes of violent treatment.</p>

<p>That treatment included waterboarding, a method of simulated drowning in which, CIA records show, Zubaydah gagged, vomited and became hysterical while the interrogators poured water into his nostrils and throat as he lay strapped down on his back. The agency’s methods also included slapping him in the face and abdomen, slamming him into a plywood wall, depriving him of sleep and locking him into small “confinement boxes” for hours at a time.</p>

<p>The videotapes also showed the faces of some members of the interrogation team, Rodriguez told Rizzo.</p>

<p>“Jose was convinced that someday, somewhere, somehow, the tapes would become public and the identities of the interrogators inevitably ‘outed,’” Rizzo wrote in his 2014 memoir, “Company Man.” “‘“60 Minutes” will do slow-mo, stop-action pictures of their faces,’ Jose emotionally put it to me, ‘and they and their families will become targets for some Al Qaeda crazy wherever they are.’”</p>

<p>A canny lawyer known for his bespoke suits and colorful ties, Rizzo was sympathetic to Rodriguez’s concerns. But Rizzo had also seen his share of agency scandals up close, and he told Rodriguez firmly “not to do anything with those tapes” until he could discuss the issue and clear any action with more senior officials.</p>

<p>“I thought that destroying the tapes was fraught with enormous risk for the agency,” Rizzo wrote. “Someone does something like that when he has something to hide.”</p>

<p>Contacted by ProPublica, Rizzo declined to discuss the episode other than to say that he stood by what he had written about it in his book.</p>

<p>On Oct. 25, just as Haspel was arriving in Thailand to take over the black site as its new “chief of base,” an email from CIA headquarters informed officers there that they should observe a new procedure for videotaping: They were to continue recording to assist in checking their notes, but use the same tape each time so that they erased the previous day’s images.</p>

<p>The cable was emphatic about the reasons for the new policy. Officials had concluded that the CIA was not legally required to preserve the tapes. They represented “a serious security risk for [redacted] officers recorded on them,” and “a danger to all Americans should the tapes be compromised.” The cable promised that someone (their identity is redacted) would be sent to Thailand “at the earliest opportunity” to “assist in destroying the tapes completely.”</p>

<p>Haspel took over as “chief of base” at the Thai prison in late October, after the waterboarding of Zubaydah had ended. A new high-level prisoner, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, arrived on Nov. 15, and was almost immediately subjected to some of the same brutal treatment. How much videotaping was done during Haspel’s tenure at the black site is not clear, but only a few of the surviving tapes would show Nashiri. None of those, officials said, include any video of Haspel.</p>

<p>Nashiri’s interrogation in Thailand lasted a little more than two weeks. Then, the operation was thrown into turmoil when a New York Times journalist began asking the agency about reports that it was holding Qaida prisoners in Thailand. Haspel was ordered to shut down the secret prison immediately.</p>

<p>The two prisoners, Zubaydah and Nashiri, were sent to a new secret CIA prison in Poland on Dec. 4. But even before their departure, a flurry of cables between Thailand and CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, focused on what to do about the tapes.</p>

<p>On Nov. 27, a CIA officer in Thailand — possibly Haspel, or perhaps the agency’s station chief in Bangkok — sent a formal cable to headquarters. According to a summary of the message disclosed years later in response to a lawsuit, it sought “approval for the destruction” of the tapes.</p>

<p>Several cables on the subject came back from headquarters. They did not say yes.</p>

<p>The following month, at Rizzo’s urging, a new chief lawyer at the CIA, Scott Muller, presented the question of what to do with the 92 tapes to the agency’s then-director, George Tenet. The agency also sent a career attorney, John McPherson, to Thailand to review the stockpile of tapes and make sure that all the activities recorded on the tapes were also accurately described in the written records.</p>

<p>Tenet agreed with the lawyers that it would be wise to destroy the tapes, officials said. But he did not want to do so without approval from both Bush’s National Security Council and at least a few leaders in Congress who had been informed of the black site program.</p>

<p>Aides to Tenet wanted a formal plan, and they instructed CTC officials to write up a memo that laid out how they would seek the necessary authorizations.</p>

<p>Of the four congressional intelligence committee members who were told about the tapes in January 2003, only Jane Harman, a California Democrat, objected to the idea of destroying them. But by then, other hurdles had emerged as well.</p>

<p>The agency’s inspector general, John Helgerson, had begun a secret investigation into the black site program, following the death in November 2002 of an Afghan detainee who was being held at a black site near Kabul. The Helgerson inquiry quickly became more serious after it emerged that a relatively junior CIA officer who had been dispatched to Poland that December had brutally abused Nashiri there, threatening him with death and menacing with a gun and a power drill.</p>

<p>Upon learning of the videotapes, Helgerson insisted on having his own investigators look at them — even if they had to fly to Thailand to do so.</p>

<p>CIA lawyers were already worried that the tapes could eventually end up in the hands of outsiders. A new blue ribbon commission had been created to investigate the origins of the 9/11 attacks, and it seemed possible they might ask for interrogation records.</p>

<p>(Although the 9/11 commission fought a long-running and ultimately unsuccessful battle to interview Zubaydah, Nashiri and other CIA prisoners, agency officials turned over classified accounts of their interrogations, but never told members of the panel that the videotapes existed.)</p>

<p>By the late spring of 2004, the tapes were becoming harder to hide. After a scandal erupted over the publication of lurid photos of prisoners being abused by Army reservists inside Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, the Justice Department withdrew its opinion authorizing the CIA’s interrogation methods.</p>

<p>At a White House meeting not long after, the senior lawyer on the National Security Council staff, John Bellinger, asked Muller, his CIA counterpart, almost casually if the agency had any of its own photographs or videotapes of prisoners. He acknowledged that it did.</p>

<p>Muller told the White House lawyers that the CIA had been hoping to destroy the videotapes at some point. The senior lawyers in the room — who included the White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales — rejected that idea immediately. David Addington, a strong supporter of the interrogation program who wielded outsized influence as the counsel to Vice President Dick Cheney, was adamantly opposed.</p>

<p>Although the inspector general had finished his inquiry into the detention program, lawyers for the French militant Zacarias Moussaoui, who was being tried on federal charges of conspiring in the 9/11 attacks, were seeking access to tapes of CIA interrogations that might help their client avoid the death penalty. They were also asking for all records relating to Abu Zubaydah.</p>

<p>In 2004, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit to press its requests for detainee records under the Freedom of Information Act. The CIA initially withheld nearly every document the ACLU sought, saying they were exempt on national security grounds.</p>

<p>Eventually, though, ACLU lawyers managed to collect a trove of CIA documents on the detainees, relying on a legal provision that allows public access to declassified versions of records that figure in investigations of possible wrongdoing. In its inquiry into the interrogation program, the CIA’s inspector general had assembled thousands of pages of documents. Crucially, investigators had also watched the tapes.</p>

<p>Rodriguez was not known as a micromanager. According to several colleagues, he took strategic advantage of Haspel’s exceptional attention to detail, relying on her to help manage highly sensitive operations as well as policy and personnel issues.</p>

<p>As her authority and influence within the agency grew, Haspel also joined Rodriguez in advocating forcefully and frequently for the destruction of the videotapes, several officials said. Rizzo wrote that they were “relentless” in lobbying him about the tapes during Rodriguez’s first months in his job as head of the Operations Directorate.</p>

<p>Scenes From a Black Site</p>

<p>At their urging, the new CIA director, Goss, a former Republican congressman, had also tried to procure the answer they wanted, taking the question in mid-2005 to his putative boss, John Negroponte, who had taken office as the country’s first director of national intelligence. (The two officials had been fraternity brothers at Yale 45 years before.)</p>

<p>Negroponte was a senior career diplomat, not an intelligence expert. But he had worked closely with the CIA as the U.S. ambassador to Honduras during the early years of the agency’s covert support for Contra rebels in the early 1980s. His knowledge of national security scandals went back to his time as a junior aide to Henry Kissinger during secret peace talks to end the Vietnam War. He told Goss in no uncertain terms that he strongly opposed any attempt to destroy the tapes, officials said.</p>

<p>Rodriguez and Haspel kept pushing. At their urging, Rizzo went back to the White House again. This time, the president had a new chief lawyer, Harriet Miers. But Miers had the same view as Gonzales. Addington, the vice president’s lawyer, remained firmly opposed as well, officials said.</p>

<p>Rizzo wrote in his book that he reported the bad news to Rodriguez and Haspel.</p>

<p>“They were crestfallen, because they were now on notice that the DNI, two successive White House counsels, and the vice president’s top lawyer had weighed in strongly against destroying the tapes,” Rizzo wrote. “To top it off, I confided to them that Porter Goss seemed distinctly unenthusiastic about the idea, too.”</p>

<p>Rizzo wrote that he told Rodriguez to “cool it for a while.” And by the fall of 2005, he said, the tapes issue had been dormant for several months. But in late October, the CIA was hit by a pair of new and serious threats.</p>

<p>As the Senate debated what would become known as the Detainee Treatment Act, Sen. Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who chaired the Armed Services Committee, also began pushing for a non-partisan commission that would examine the treatment of terror detainees — including by the CIA. As the proposal gained support, Rizzo warned his colleagues that such an inquiry would “obviously surface the tapes’ existence.”</p>

<p>“I think I need to be the skunk at the party again and see if the Director is willing to let us try one more time to get the right people downtown on board with the notion of our destroying the tapes,” Rizzo wrote in an email.</p>

<p>Two lawyers wrote back, saying they supported the idea of pressing the issue with Goss, the CIA director. One of the lawyers, who was assigned to the CTC, asserted that the tapes “should have been destroyed in the normal course of business 2 years ago.”</p>

<p>Around the same time, officials said, The Washington Post informed the agency that it was preparing an extensive report on the black sites. Rodriguez was among those enlisted to try to dissuade the paper from publishing some details, but the story appeared on Nov. 2, and it sent shock waves through CIA headquarters.</p>

<p>“It was something only a little bit less than a full nuclear explosion,” one former senior official recalled.</p>

<p>A few miles from CIA headquarters, the federal judge overseeing the Moussaoui trial, Leonie Brinkema, was also apparently struck by the story.</p>

<p>Acting as his own lawyer, Moussaoui had sought to elicit testimony from Abu Zubaydah, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other captured militants in order to try to prove that he was not one of them. The government had refused, agreeing only to provide written summaries of what they had said under questioning.</p>

<p>In April 2005, Moussaoui pleaded guilty, triggering the sentencing phase of the trial. Brinkema demanded that national security agencies scour their files for video or audiotapes of detainee interrogations. Because of redactions in the court record, it is not clear which detainees were included in her order. But she was skeptical of prosecutors’ previous assertions that no such tapes existed.</p>

<p>“I want clear representations under the penalty of perjury from the appropriate officials — and this has to include the CIA, the FBI, the Department of Defense, the NSA, and frankly any government agency involved in this work — that there have not been any video or audio recordings made of these witnesses by any United States or other governmental agencies during this process,” she said.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Nov. 3, the day after The Washington Post story, Brinkema again ordered the government to search for video or audio of captured militants.</p>

<p>As the pressures mounted, Rodriguez had an epiphany.</p>

<p>“I finally came to the realization that nobody was going to make this decision for us,” he recalled in an interview. “Not the director. Not John Rizzo. Not the White House. Who are we kidding? This thing would just go on.”</p>

<p>Back at his seventh-floor office at CIA headquarters, Rodriguez conveyed his realization to Haspel. “I met with Gina and I told Gina, ‘I’m going to make this decision myself. Who are we kidding? No one is going to make the decision. People are just kicking the can down the road.”</p>

<p>The two officials worked out a plan to resolve the problem once and for all, he said. At Rodriguez’s request, Haspel convened a meeting with a few officials, including two senior lawyers assigned to the Directorate of Operations, Steven Hermes and Robert Eatinger.</p>

<p>Rodriguez and others have emphasized that Haspel sought the lawyers’ on-the-record answers to two questions: Would it be legal for the agency to destroy the tapes? And did Rodriguez, as the head of the NCS, have the authority to order it?</p>

<p>Hermes and Eatinger moved quickly to answer Rodriguez’s two questions. They examined regulations on the destruction of documents and consulted their colleague, John McPherson — the same senior CIA lawyer who had gone to Thailand to review the tapes three years earlier. McPherson answered that there was no legal impediment to destroying the tapes.</p>

<p>According to the accounts of some of the officials involved, Haspel proposed that the agency use the scheduled transfer of its Bangkok station chief — who still had the tapes locked in his office safe — to force a new (and hopefully different) answer to the question of whether the tapes could be destroyed.</p>

<p>It was decided that the station chief would send a cable back to headquarters making a formal request to destroy the tapes. According to Rodriguez, the lawyers went so far as to suggest wording for the cable.</p>

<p>Different officials have offered somewhat different accounts of how the plan was supposed to unfold from there. Rizzo, who was then the CIA’s chief lawyer, wrote that he had been told the cable would be used to initiate a new round of appeals to administration officials and Congress — which he thought were doomed to result in the same denials.</p>

<p>According to the CIA’s chief spokesman, Dean Boyd, Haspel then drafted a second cable that she believed would be used by Rodriguez to initiate a conversation with Goss about the urgent need to destroy the tapes. That cable was in Rodriguez’s name, and it said he approved the request from Thailand to destroy the tapes.</p>

<p>Haspel “drafted the cable to destroy the tapes” at Rodriguez’s direction, Boyd said in the agency’s written statement on Tuesday evening, “but she did so with the understanding that he would use the draft cable to raise this issue with DCIA Porter Goss to find a final resolution of this matter.”</p>

<p>Why Rodriguez would see the need to approach Goss with the draft cable in hand — rather than, say, the cable he received from Thailand asking permission to destroy the tapes — is unclear. One former CIA official said the idea was to underscore to Goss the urgency of the situation and Rodriguez’s willingness to accept responsibility for the action.</p>

<p>But in Rodriguez’s long and detailed account of the episode in his own memoir — published in 2012, before the details of Haspel’s version of events became public — he never mentioned any sort of plan to take the issue up with Goss. Nor did he say anything about such an intention in his interview with ProPublica.</p>

<p>Rather, he stressed in the interview that he had decided to act on his own because he was convinced that neither Goss nor other officials in the administration would ever summon the political will to do so.</p>

<p>Sometime after Haspel drafted the cable in which her boss directed the tapes’ destruction, Rodriguez recalled that he stared at it for a while on his computer. Haspel had left the office, he said.</p>

<p>“I looked at it, thought about it for a while and eventually I hit release,” he said. “I released it myself to make clear to everybody that I was the responsible person who authorized it.”</p>

<p>At some point later, Haspel returned to her desk and realized that Rodriguez had sent the cable off to Thailand. Boyd, the CIA spokesman, said, “she asked whether he had raised this matter with [Director] Goss. He told Haspel that he had not talked to the [CIA director] and had sent out the cable based on his understanding of his authority as head of the Clandestine Service.”</p>

<p>Boyd gave no indication of how much time elapsed between when Rodriguez sent the cable and when Haspel saw it. Nor did he say whether she had any opportunity to persuade him to countermand the order, or to warn any other officials at CIA headquarters of what Rodriguez had done.</p>

<p>Rizzo wrote that he learned what had happened the following day, Nov. 9, when one of his lawyers forwarded him a copy of a subsequent cable from Bangkok in which the station chief confirmed to Rodriguez that he had finished feeding the tapes into a large shredding machine.</p>

<p>“WHAT?!?!” Rizzo wrote back.</p>

<p>The cable that Rodriguez had sent to Thailand — the cable that Haspel had drafted authorizing the destruction of the tapes — had not been copied to any CIA lawyers or other officials, as was standard procedure for such a message, officials said.</p>

<p>Rizzo “was just beside himself,” a former colleague said.</p>

<p>Goss, the CIA director, was considerably less upset, several former officials said.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Rodriguez said at a meeting that he was ready to take any political heat for what he had done. Goss responded that no, he would be the one to take the heat.</p>

<p>But there was no heat, because there was no wider acknowledgement of what had occurred. According to Rizzo, Goss told him he would discreetly inform congressional leaders that the tapes had been destroyed. But he never did. Members of Congress only found out what had happened when The New York Times published an article two years later, revealing for the first time that the tapes had existed — and had been destroyed.</p>

<p>After Rodriguez, Haspel became perhaps the primary subject of the tapes investigation, two former CIA officials said. Called back from London, where she was serving as the CIA’s station chief, she was grilled for hours by federal investigators, an experience that the former officials said shook her deeply.</p>

<p>But in November 2010, after more than two years of investigation, the federal prosecutor who led the investigation into the destruction of the tapes, John Durham, decided not to bring any criminal charges. The CIA’s long delay in acknowledging the tapes’ destruction meant that the five-year statute of limitations had run. Durham concluded that it would be difficult to prove criminal intent, officials said, because Haspel and Rodriguez had been advised by the CIA lawyers that they could legally destroy the tapes.</p>

<p>Durham concluded the CIA lawyers had gotten it wrong. No such legal authority existed. In his book, Morell wrote the prosecutor had found that “agency lawyers had erred in their legal judgment.”</p>

<p>On Durham’s recommendation, the CIA’s then-director, David Petraeus, assigned Morell to convene an accountability board of senior agency officials to review the actions of Rodriguez and the CIA lawyers. Morell decided to conduct the review by himself.</p>

<p>He made little effort to hide his sympathy for Rodriguez and Haspel. To inform Rodriguez of his review, he invited Rodriguez out for drinks. He concluded that Rodriguez had violated the instructions of his superiors and he issued a letter of reprimand but decided to waive other sanctions. A spokesman for Morell, Nick Shapiro, a former deputy chief of staff of the agency, said that because Rodriguez was already retired, the only penalty Morell could have imposed would have been to take away his pension — a punishment usually reserved for cases of espionage.</p>

<p>“Ms Haspel did not destroy the tapes,” Mr. Morell said in a statement explaining why his 2011 inquiry found “no fault” with her performance. “She did not oversee the destruction of the tapes. And she did not order the destruction of the tapes. She drafted a cable under the instruction of her boss.”</p>

<h2 id="baltimoretopaylargestsettlementincityhistoryd9milliontomanwrongfullyconvictedofmurder">Baltimore to Pay Largest Settlement in City History — $9 Million — to Man Wrongfully Convicted of Murder</h2>

<p>by: Megan Rose</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-02</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/baltimore-to-pay-largest-settlement-in-city-history-9-million-to-man-wrongfully-convicted-of-murder </p>

<p>James Owens was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1988 for a murder he didn't commit.</p>

<p>Ignoring Innocence</p>

<p>Baltimore officials today approved a $9 million settlement — the largest in city history — to James “J.J.” Owens, who spent two decades in prison for a murder he didn’t commit.</p>

<p>Owens’ case, and that of another man prosecuted for the same crime, was the subject of an investigation by ProPublica and The Atlantic last September that examined how defendants are pressured into controversial plea deals despite proof of their innocence.</p>

<p>Owens’ payout adds to Baltimore’s growing tab for decades of misconduct by its police force. In November, a jury awarded another wrongfully convicted Baltimore man, Sabein Burgess, $15 million. Like Owens, Burgess had sued, alleging civil rights violations by detectives.</p>

<p>Because Baltimore is self-insured, city taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for these payouts, which total $24 million in the last six months alone.</p>

<p>Now the city is girding itself for more costly lawsuits in the aftermath of a massive police corruption scandal that led to the conviction of eight officers earlier this year.</p>

<p>Owens’ saga began in 1988 when he was convicted of the murder of 24-year-old Colleen Williar based almost exclusively on the ever-changing story of James Thompson, his neighbor and former friend. Thompson became wrapped up in the case when he lied about finding the murder weapon in a foolish attempt to get a $1,000 police reward. When detectives questioned his story, Thompson pointed the finger at Owens, telling them multiple false versions of events about Williar’s rape and murder.</p>

<p>Detectives had pressured Thompson in the interrogation room until they had “enough to get James Owens,” as one of the detectives later put it. Owens’ lawsuit alleged that the detectives purposefully didn’t tell his attorneys about Thompson’s waffling, as is required by law.</p>

<p>Thompson was subsequently tried and convicted in Williar’s rape and murder, and both he and Owens were sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

<p>An error occurred.</p>

<p>But in 2006, semen found in the victim was tested, and the DNA didn’t match Owens or Thompson. Other key forensic evidence proved to be unrelated to the men or wrongly analyzed. Instead of letting the men go free, the Baltimore state’s attorney’s office doubled down. After Owens was granted a new trial, the prosecutors refused to concede his innocence and instead tried to force him into a troubling deal known as an Alford plea. If he took it, Owens would be quickly released from prison and allowed to maintain his innocence on the record, but he’d still be a convicted murderer. And, significantly for cities with checkered histories, the deal would have prevented him from suing. For their part, prosecutors would keep a win on the books and avoid admitting a mistake.</p>

<p>Owens refused, and prosecutors left him languishing in prison for 16 months before admitting there wasn’t enough evidence to re-try him. On the day his new trial was set to begin in October 2008, the prosecutor dropped the charges, and Owens walked out fully exonerated. Thompson, however, took the Alford plea and was left with no recourse to sue for his own wrongful incarceration.</p>

<p>Owens filed his lawsuit in 2011, but it was dismissed from federal court and his lawyers dropped out of the case. In federal lawsuits like Owens’, it’s not enough to show that an innocent man was put in prison for a crime he didn’t commit; the defendant must also prove there was official misconduct that violated his constitutional rights. Winning on such civil rights claims is notoriously difficult.</p>

<p>In late 2012, lawyer Charles Curlett and the local Baltimore law firm Brown Goldstein Levy picked up the longshot case and appealed the dismissal.</p>

<p>“My view was it was a fight worth fighting, and if there was a way to navigate the litigation and achieve justice we would try and find it,” Curlett said.</p>

<p>Out of about 800 civil rights suits filed nationwide, only slightly more than half prevailed, according to Jeffrey Gutman, a law professor at George Washington University. Gutman examined the cases of 1,900 exonerees who had been convicted in a state court as recorded by National Registry of Exonerations from 1989 to about March 2017. In Maryland, the ratio was worse. Only six of the 24 people on the registry received payouts from the state, Gutman’s data showed. Owens is only the third Maryland exoneree from the national registry to receive compensation for a civil rights claims. Three others have been awarded money under the state statute, with payouts ranging from $300,000 to $1.4 million.</p>

<p>But during the last six years, views of law enforcement have changed drastically. In 2014, the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a local police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off nationwide protests and debates about law enforcement accountability and racism. Baltimore saw its own mass protests a year later when Freddie Gray died in police custody. Though prosecutions against the officers involved were unsuccessful, the city agreed to pay Gray’s family $6.4 million.</p>

<p>Owens won his appeal, and during settlement negotiations, which had stalled on and off for the last year, a series of decisions made it clear that jurors were fed up. First, last fall, a federal jury awarded Burgess $15 million, more than three quarters of a million dollars for each year he was wrongly behind bars.</p>

<p>Then, this year, six members of an elite police gun task force pleaded guilty and two others were convicted for systematically robbing citizens for years.</p>

<p>“It may not be as difficult now for plaintiffs like Owens to persuade federal jurors that the police did actually engage in misconduct,” said Michele Nethercott, head of the University of Baltimore Innocence Project Clinic.</p>

<p>Curlett agreed, noting that “the public view concerning the infallibility of law enforcement has changed, and juries across the country are becoming far more willing to recognize police misconduct.”</p>

<p>So as Owens’ case headed to a federal jury this month, Baltimore city officials had learned their lesson.</p>

<p>“That jury verdict certainly was one of the factors that I considered,” Dana Moore, Baltimore’s deputy city solicitor, said about settling with Owens.</p>

<p>“I think they correctly analyzed the risk to the city,” said Steven Mercer, the former public defender who represented by Owens and Thompson in their innocence claims. “The facts of each case really drive it and the facts for J.J. are quite compelling.”</p>

<p>The city noted in its summary of the case that the police department and the officers involved “dispute virtually all of the material facts alleged by Mr. Owens.” Moore also said the settlement wasn’t an admittance of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>Owens was hesitant to settle. After prosecutors refused to admit his innocence, he said he wanted a jury in open court to review the facts of his case and cast judgment on the officers who put him away.</p>

<p>“They kept coming back to me with these numbers, and I said ‘No, that’s not good enough,’” Owens said in an interview.</p>

<p>Owens’ steadfastness “paid a large dividend here,” Mercer said. “He was willing to go to trial and risk it all and only settled when there was a number that speaks loudly to his actual innocence and the wrongfulness of his conviction and incarceration.”</p>

<p>On average, exonerees nationwide have received $295,000 for each year spent in prison, Gutman said his data showed. Owens received nearly half a million for each of the more than 20 years he spent behind bars.</p>

<p>Still, nationwide experts see little deterrent effect in these types of payouts on police or prosecutorial misconduct or incompetence.</p>

<p>“I’m always astonished still how little impact they seem to have on police procedures and criminal investigations going forward,” said Sam Gross, law professor at University of Michigan and cofounder of the National Registry of Exonerations. City officials “approve payments and life goes on and the same things happen again year after year and decade after decade.”</p>

<p>In Baltimore, city officials are preparing for more lawsuits. The new city solicitor, Andre Davis, who took the position in September, has recognized the city needs to get ahead of them and is looking to be more proactive in identifying and settling cases earlier — particularly suits potentially arising out of the “verdicts and all the evidence that came out” the corruption scandal, Moore said. “Those trials do inform us of potential issues.”</p>

<p>“When [Davis] brought me in as deputy, he made it clear that cases that could be settled early should be and would be,” Moore said. “It’s something he absolutely wants to do.”</p>

<p>When the city approved the settlement on Wednesday morning, Owens was at work hanging gutters for his cousin’s company like he has been since he was released in 2008. He’s given his cousin two weeks’ notice and plans to build a house where he can work on restoring cars like he did before he went to prison. He told his cousin when he quit that he “wanted to sit back and relax.”</p>

<p>Still, Owens said, “I’d rather have the time back than the money.”</p>

<p>by: Logan Jaffe</p>

<p>date: 2018-05-03</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/ask-propublica-illinois-journalism-questions-recap </p>

<p>Ask ProPublica Illinois</p>

<p>In early January, we at ProPublica Illinois decided to make explaining our jobs part of our jobs. We asked you to send us questions about how journalism works — and since then we’ve been chipping away at answering those questions in our ongoing series, Ask ProPublica Illinois.</p>

<p>With five answered questions under our belt — and dozens more waiting to be answered — we thought it’d be a good time to recap what we’ve done so far.</p>

<p>But before we get into that, I’d like to point out something I’ve noticed about the questions we’ve already answered: These are questions we, as journalists, are constantly asking ourselves. Sure, the principles behind these questions — don’t get too chummy with sources, don’t be biased, don’t report false information — have been drilled into us since journalism school or however else we came to the profession. But the lived, experiential versions of these questions are evolving backdrops to our everyday professional lives, and they spark many newsroom conversations. Our answers aren’t static either; they are often ongoing conversations. For this reason, there’s value in bringing those conversations into a public space, and I’m heartened to see how often your questions parallel the questions our newsroom asks of itself.</p>

<p>OK, here’s what we’ve got so far. And if you think of a question you’d like to ask us, email us any time at illinois@propublica.org.</p>

<p>This is a timeless question that journalists in our newsroom are constantly aware of. Deputy Editor Steve Mills lays out a spectrum of possible journalist/source relationships and specifics to consider with each. The fundamentals? Reporters shouldn’t lie to sources. Reporters shouldn’t give advice to sources. Reporters and editors — not sources — decide what a story is and when it’s ready to publish. Which brings us to another question …</p>

<p>This is a question about how we, as an investigative journalism shop, balance the need to thoroughly investigate a story and the need to get it published while it’s still news. ProPublica Illinois reporter Melissa Sanchez answers using the example of a story she was working on at the time: How Chicago Ticket Debt Sends Black Motorists Into Bankruptcy. The short — if unsexy — answer? Deadlines and a solid production plan; mastering the topic you’re reporting on so you can best understand what can be shorter, timelier pieces versus a longer investigation; and balancing the reporting and publication schedule to reflect that balance.</p>

<p>Ah, we could write a textbook about this. But reporter Jason Grotto boils it down to this: “Every reporter should seek out facts that might produce a counternarrative.” Jason writes about his own mantra in making sure his stories don’t have slants: “No surprises … Anyone mentioned in the story should know before publication what the story will say and have a chance to respond — not only to specific facts but also to how the story is framed.” You should definitely take notes on this one. Read it.</p>

<p>Obviously a relevant topic right now (and maybe why this particular answer was picked up by the Boise Weekly, The Courier from the College of DuPage, Salt Lake City’s KSL.com, Poynter and The American Press Institute). There are lots of good answers and resources to this question, including this handy infographic from the International Federation of Library Associations, these “Teachable Moments” from The News Literacy Project, and from fact-checking websites like PolitiFact. ProPublica Illinois web producer Vignesh Ramachandran spoke with Dan Gillmor, a professor at Arizona State University’s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, and Craig Silverman, media editor at BuzzFeed News. Both advised that identifying fake news involves a healthy level of skepticism — both intellectually and emotionally. “False news is also often twisted to present a story that triggers you emotionally, whether that’s anger or sadness, Silverman said. “If they can do that, then the chances of you reacting to it by liking it or retweeting it are much greater.”</p>

<p>At ProPublica Illinois, we’re lucky to be working with two young journalists, Natalie Escobar and Andrea Salcedo, as part of ProPublica’s Emerging Reporters initiative. Today, there are lots of great avenues for young journalists to get training. In Chicago alone, there’s City Bureau’s fellows program, Free Spirit Media, and projects such as Young Chicago Authors’ The Chicago Beat. In this piece, Natalie writes about her experience as a journalism student at Northwestern’s Medill School of Journalism and the ever-present fear of the “Medill F.”</p>

<p>Now, some questions for you: Is this helpful? Are you using our answers to these questions in some way — maybe in a class you teach, or as a journalist yourself? We’d love to hear your feedback on this series. You can email us at illinois@propublica.org. And, again, if you have a question that comes to mind about how journalism works and how we do our jobs, don’t hesitate to ask.</p>

<p>Enjoy your weekend. And thanks for reading.</p>

<p>How Asylum Works</p>

<p>How Asylum Works — and Doesn’t Work</p>

<p>Follow the path of immigrants fleeing violence or persecution, and get a glimpse into the complicated, evolving system designed to grant them refuge in the United States.</p>

<p>Years-long wait lists, bewildering legal arguments, an extended stay in detention — you can experience it all in the Waiting Game, a newsgame that simulates the experience of trying to seek asylum in the United States. The game was created by ProPublica, Playmatics and WNYC. Based on the true stories of real asylum-seekers, this interactive portal allows users to follow in the footsteps of five people fleeing persecution and trying to take refuge in America.</p>

<p>The process can be exhausting and feel arbitrary – and as you’ll find in the game, it involves a lot of waiting. Once asylum-seekers reach America, they must condense complex and often traumatic stories into short, digestible narratives they will tell again and again. Their lives often depend on their ability to convince a judge that they are in danger. Judicial decisions are so inconsistent across the country, success in complicated cases can come down to geography and luck -- in New York City only 17 percent of asylum cases are denied in immigration court; in Atlanta, 94 percent are. Increasingly, many asylum-seekers are held in detention for months or even years while going through the system. The immigration detention system costs more than $2 billion per year to maintain.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has tried to reframe the asylum system as a national security threat and a magnet for illegal immigration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions characterizes the American asylum process as “subject to rampant abuse” and “overloaded with fake claims.” He has aimed recent reforms at expediting asylum adjudications to speed up deportations and at making it more difficult for certain groups to qualify for protection, such as Central Americans who claim to fear gender-based violence or gang persecution.</p>

<p>The narrative that the system is overrun with fraud has long been pushed by groups that favor limiting immigration overall. They point to some 37 percent of asylum-seekers who annually miss their immigration hearings as evidence that people without legitimate fears of persecution game the system. They argue that allowing asylum-seekers to obtain work permits while they wait for a decision on their cases — which sometimes takes years — incentivizes baseless claims.</p>

<p>But another picture emerged when ProPublica spoke with more than 20 experts and stakeholders who study and work in the asylum system, including lawyers, immigration judges, historians, policy experts, an asylum officer, a former border patrol agent and a former ICE prosecutor.</p>

<p>When asked about changes to the system they’d like to see, many suggested providing asylum-seekers with better access to lawyers to support due process, expanding the definition of a refugee to cover modern-day conflicts,providing more resources to help the system process claims in a timely manner, and improving judicial independence by moving immigration courts out of the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Most acknowledged some level of asylum-claim abuse exists. “In any system, of course, there are going to be some bad actors and some weaknesses people seek to exploit,” said Doris Meissner, the former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993 to 2000.</p>

<p>But they also argued for the importance of protecting and improving a national program that has provided refuge to hundreds of thousands of people. “If you are going to make a mistake in the immigration area, make this mistake,” said Bill Hing, director of the University of San Francisco’s Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic. “Protect people that may not need protecting, but don’t make the mistake of not protecting people who need it.”</p>

<p>Victor Manjarrez, a former border patrol agent from the 1980s until 2011, said he had seen human smuggling networks exploit the border over the years, but also many people who genuinely needed help.</p>

<p>“We have a system that's not perfect, but is designed to take refugees. That is the beauty of it,” he said. “It has a lot of issues, but we have something in place that is designed to be compassionate. And that’s why we have such a big political debate about this.”</p>

<p>The asylum system was created in the wake of the U.S. and other countries’ refusal to let in Jewish refugees during the Holocaust.</p>

<p>World War II sparked our current asylum and refugee policy. During the war, safe countries like the United States largely shut their doors to Jewish refugees, citing national security concerns. In one notorious example, the U.S. turned away a boat of nearly 1,000 Jews escaping Nazi Germany in 1939. More than a quarter of the ship’s refugees eventually were killed in Europe during the Holocaust.</p>

<p>After the war, the international community attempted to create a more orderly system for aiding people in danger. This resulted in the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention and its 1967 protocol, which defined a refugee as a person fleeing persecution based on “race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.” The convention included an article prohibiting countries from penalizing refugees for entering a foreign country illegally as long as “they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.” It also obligated signatories not to return any asylum-seekers to countries where their lives or freedom would be threatened.</p>

<p>The U.S. signed on, but initially dealt with refugee crises on a case-by-case basis, usually tied to foreign policy objectives. Early major refugee programs addressed people fleeing Communist countries, including the resettlement of Hungarian refugees after the 1956 revolution, the Vietnamese resettlement program after the Vietnam War, and refugee boat lifts after the Cuban revolution.</p>

<p>The U.S.’ current system to accept refugees wasn’t created until decades later.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until President Jimmy Carter’s last year in office that the U.S. passed a formal law, the 1980 Refugee Act, to provide a permanent system for admitting refugees. This law was a product of the universal human rights activist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, a moment when nationalism was at an ebb. “It set up a mechanism where the United States can accept refugees from all over the world. In the decades prior, those admissions were much more targeted and limited,” said Carl Bon Tempo, a historian at SUNY Albany and the author of Americans at the Gate: The United States and Refugees during the Cold War.</p>

<p>The law created formal programs: for refugee resettlement from abroad, and for asylum-seekers who ask for protection once already inside the U.S.</p>

<p>On the simplest level, the law had two components: one that resettles refugees vetted abroad by the United Nations, and another to process asylum-seekers fleeing immediate danger who arrive in America first and then apply for protection.</p>

<p>If a person seeking protection makes it into the interior of the U.S. — often after first entering on a legal visa — they can file what is called an “affirmative” asylum application within one year. This means they’ll have an interview with a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officer in a non-adversarial setting. Less than a third of applicants are granted asylum in the interview stage. The rest are referred to immigration court.</p>

<p>If an asylum-seeker presents a claim at the border or is caught and ordered deported but expresses a “credible fear” of persecution in their home country, they can only file a “defensive” application — and then are sent straight to the immigration court system. Applicants have about a 50 percent chance of receiving asylum in the courts, though it varies widely by judge.</p>

<p>When Congress passed the 1980 Refugee Act, they didn’t anticipate how often it would be used.</p>

<p>“When asylum was first written into the Refugee Act, it was not viewed as the path that maybe tens of thousands of people, or even thousands of people, might claim annually as their way to get in,” said Bon Tempo. “It was seen as a legal pathway for someone to gain admission, but that very few will pursue.”</p>

<p>That’s not what happened. The introduction of the act coincided with civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua that triggered a large-scale migration. Asylum applications quickly rose. Over the years, the expansion of affordable travel has also meant that asylum-seekers from all over the world can more easily reach the U.S. on visas to find immediate safety and then apply for protection. The number of asylum applications has fluctuated over the years, but in 2014, it began to rise sharply, this time mostly from Central Americans trying to escape rampant gang violence their governments have been unable to control. Most of them arrived at the border and filed defensive asylum applications.</p>

<p>“Part of the problem with modern asylum procedure is you have so many people applying, many more than the system can actually handle,” Bon Tempo said.</p>

<p>Though the law hasn’t changed, the Trump administration has been reshaping the asylum system in other ways.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has promised to cut both legal and illegal immigration. A big piece of this effort is reframing the asylum system as a national security issue instead of a humanitarian program and characterizing asylum-seekers at the border as illegal entrants.</p>

<p>“Congress has so far refused to pass draconian legislation the administration wants that would cut off access to U.S. refugee protection,” said Eleanor Acer, the director of the refugee protection program at Human Rights First. “The administration is trying to do everything it can… to limit access to asylum and to rush people through the process, giving the appearance of due process while at the same time undercutting it.”</p>

<p>When asked about the criticism, a spokesperson from the Department of Justice said the reforms are “common sense” and “designed to increase efficiency and productivity in an immigration court system that has languished after years of neglect and failed leadership, and all are made while ensuring that due process is not compromised.”</p>

<p>Much of the administration’s efforts have been aimed at the asylum case backlog.</p>

<p>The recent spike in claims from Central Americans at the U.S.-Mexico border has contributed to an unprecedented backlog of more than 680,000 cases in immigration courts, more than double the number in 2013 (these include both defensive asylum cases and other types of immigration cases). There are also 300,000 affirmative cases waiting to be processed by USCIS, an increase of 1,750 percent over the last five years. Asylum-seekers often wait three to four years to have their cases heard, and the process can take even longer if they are initially denied and then appeal their cases. In 2016, the most current year of complete data available, 20,455 applicants were granted asylum and 11,643 were denied. In the same year, more than 180,000 new asylum applications were filed.</p>

<p>Some, like Sessions, worry that a backlog invites perverse incentives. Once asylum-seekers file an application, some are eligible to apply for a work permit if they have not received a decision after 180 days. (It usually takes 240 days to actually get a work permit.) If their cases take years to be reviewed, that means they may spend all that time working and establishing themselves in the U.S., and eventually can apply for another form of legal residency.</p>

<p>Though Sessions argues there is “rampant fraud” in the asylum system, there is no clear evidence to quantify how widespread the problem is.</p>

<p>Experts say fraud does not define the system.</p>

<p>“We do a really good job of handling asylum fraud,” said a current USCIS asylum officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Even if someone manages to get a benefit in the short term, we always come back and get them. We do asylum terminations if we find evidence.” Examples include identifying rehearsed stories that are repeated over and over, or catching misrepresentations, like African men who claim persecution because they are gay, but later file for a wife’s residency papers.</p>

<p>Many asylum-seekers with legal representation also undergo physical and psychological evaluations to help support their case, and sometimes country experts are called to assess an asylum-seeker’s story. The Executive Office of Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts, also has a Law Library and Immigration Research Center to keep up-to-date on human rights conditions in different countries.</p>

<p>Most immigration experts say outright fraud is rare. Even though many asylum cases are rejected, they are usually filed by people in good faith with legitimate fears, but who may not fit a narrow interpretation of asylum law.</p>

<p>Other false claims, as Javad Khazeli, a former ICE prosecutor from 2003 to 2010 explained, can be attributed to immigration scams. Over the years, he saw cases of immigrants duped by what’s known as a “notario” — people who falsely market themselves as qualified to give legal advice. These non-attorneys sometimes promise undocumented immigrants they can help them obtain a work permit, and instead file an asylum claim on their behalf. The person gets a work permit while they’re waiting, and then are surprised and confused when their case comes up, Khazeli, now an immigration lawyer, said.</p>

<p>But he questioned trying to paint the asylum system as rife with false claims. “One of the driving forces of the small percentage of fraudulent cases are notarios, sure,” he said. “How do you put notarios out of business? You make sure people have access to good legal services.”</p>

<p>Advocates say there’s a problem with the system that needs to be addressed: The government should provide asylum-seekers with lawyers, since the cases often involve life or death stakes.</p>

<p>This was a solution favored by many experts ProPublica spoke with. While asylum-seekers have the right to find legal representation, they are not entitled to a free lawyer. Applicants have legal counsel in only 37 percent of cases that go through immigration courts. Asylum-seekers held in detention in remote locations often have particular difficulty finding representation. This can make a big difference: 90 percent of applicants without representation had their cases denied in 2016, versus nearly 50 percent of applicants with lawyers.</p>

<p>“These are death penalty cases — you fear you'll be killed if you are sent back and you don't even have an attorney,” said Karen Musalo, the director of the Center for Gender &amp; Refugee Studies at University of California Hastings. Even children are not guaranteed legal representation. Yet, studies have shown that children who have access to legal counsel are far more likely to show up for their hearing than those who don’t.</p>

<p>Though it’s difficult to estimate how much it would cost the federal government to provide legal counsel to every applicant in immigration court, a few studies have tried to put a number on it: A 2014 economic analysis estimated that such a program would largely be offset by reduced detention costs, and cost $4 million extra a year. A study from 2016 that focused on California estimated each immigration case would cost $5,000 in legal fees.</p>

<p>Instead, the Justice Department seems to have made it even more difficult for asylum-seekers to access legal counsel.</p>

<p>This month, Sessions announced the department would temporarily halt a know-your-rights and pro-bono legal program and telephone help-line that serves nearly 50,000 detained immigrants per year, in order to assess effectiveness and costs. The program costs $6 million annually.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we pay enough attention to our immigration court system,” said Manjarrez, the former Border Patrol agent. Lawyers who are familiar with complicated immigration law can also help make sure asylum claims are clear and well-documented, saving time, he said. “If checks are being cut and I'm the Border Patrol guy, and they say, 'We’ll give you more agents and more wall,’ I‘d say, ‘No -- send it to the immigration courts.’ It’ll help us in the long term, because they'll help the flow and start to slow detentions.”</p>

<p>The immigration court system has made progress in hiring new judges since Trump took office, putting the total at 334. But more than 100 positions are still vacant and advocates estimate it would take around 200 extra judges to tackle the backlog.</p>

<p>Another short-term tactic to stem the backlog and limit fraud is to process newer asylum cases more quickly. In March, USCIS announced a new policy: Instead of processing affirmative asylum claims on a chronological basis, they’ll now switch to handling the newest claims first. Lawyers are alarmed that clients with strong asylum claims who have been waiting for years to move on with their lives will now be put on hold indefinitely. “I think that’s going to have a devastating impact,” said Jaya Ramji-Nogales, a law professor at Temple University and the author of Refugee Roulette. “If their claim was granted, they could bring their family over and regularize their family’s status here. Now they’ll be stuck in limbo.”</p>

<p>But Meissner saw the measure as a pragmatic step to restore faith in the system and get asylum claims processed in a timely manner again. She said during her time leading the INS, the precursor to USCIS, she faced the challenge of reducing a backlog of more than 400,000 cases in 1994. INS instituted a similar last-in, first-out system and made asylum-seekers wait six months to get a work permit instead of as soon as they filed an application. The changes yielded results: new claims slowed and approvals went up. “These are tough decisions,” she said. “What you want to do is set up the system that makes it possible to do the job and curb the possibility of abuses.”</p>

<p>More worrisome to some are new policies aimed at the courts. </p>

<p>Sessions has broad authority over immigration courts because they operate under the U.S. Department of Justice. This means he has the power to select immigration judges, overturn Board of Immigration Appeals decisions, and decide precedents, all with little oversight.</p>

<p>In April, the Justice Department introduced a quota system on immigration judges tied to their job performance ratings. The new rule requires judges to process at least 700 cases a year (they usually process an average of 678) to earn a satisfactory grade. Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said such a change would damage the court’s credibility. “Quotas and deadlines that have been announced are, frankly, unreasonable,” she said. “The very concept is in conflict with the independent decision-making authority of judges.”</p>

<p>Last year, the Justice Department also released a memo encouraging immigration judges to “carefully consider administrative efficiency” before granting continuance requests, which allow asylum-seekers extra time to find legal representation or gather necessary documents. The memo cited a 2012 DOJ Inspector General report that found that “frequent and lengthy continuances” were a significant factor in increased case processing times and that over half of all cases surveyed had one or more continuances.</p>

<p>Lawyers predicted these new policies may actually increase the immigration court backlog because rushed asylum hearings would result in more lawyers appealing cases, arguing that due process was violated.</p>

<p>Recent changes aren’t just about speeding up asylum decisions and deportations.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Trump often decried what he called “catch and release” -- processing asylum-seekers with an initial screening at the border, and then releasing them on bond until their court date. His administration has begun detaining almost all defensive asylum-seekers coming through the border until their cases are heard, arguing that this is a necessary step to ensure the immigrants don’t melt away and miss their hearings.</p>

<p>But lawyers see the expansion of detention as an effort to deter asylum-seekers from continuing with their claims — which contravenes international law. “Our detention system is unique in the way that it is truly prison-like, even though we recognize that asylum is not part of the criminal justice process,” said Denise Gilman, a law professor who runs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas. Keeping asylum-seekers locked up for months or even years when they’ve committed no crime further traumatizes people already suffering, she said. Some simply give up and accept deportation in order to leave detention.</p>

<p>Sessions has also indicated plans to make it even more difficult for some types of asylum cases to qualify for protection. In March, he referred two major Board of Immigration Appeals cases to himself. In one, he vacated a ruling that held asylum applicants have the right to a full hearing before a judge, an effort to cut off asylum-seekers who spend years trying to appeal denied cases or who have cases that, on paper, look unlikely to succeed. Advocates worry the decision may be used to summarily deport asylum-seekers who face language barriers or have difficulty documenting their asylum claims, especially those without legal counsel.</p>

<p>In the other case, he is reviewing whether victims of “private crime” – in this case, domestic violence – can qualify for asylum. Experts predict the decision may also be used to prevent most Central Americans fleeing gang violence from receiving asylum.</p>

<p>Gang violence and domestic abuse fall under the most flexible of the five asylum categories: “membership in a particular social group.” This has been a controversial category for years, lawyers said, because it does not have a clear definition. In parts of Central America, people don’t face outright war, “but high levels of civil violence, often combined with an inability of the government to protect its people,” said Leon Rodriguez, director of USCIS from 2013 to 2017. “The upshot is that you have a lot of people who are pretty scared, and in a lot of cases, are really at risk of dying violently when returning to countries, but it doesn’t fit into the traditional definition of asylum and refugee status.”</p>

<p>Some judges regularly accept the “particular social group” categorization for women facing gender-based violence; others rarely do. In recent years, gang violence in Central America has risen to an unprecedented level and pushed countless people to flee for their lives, but the courts still only recognize Central Americans claiming gang persecution as legitimate asylum-seekers in narrow cases – around 80 percent of asylum claims from Central America were denied in immigration court in 2016.</p>

<p>While Sessions’ decision on the issue, expected in May, may narrow the definition to exclude almost all Central American claims, advocates have long argued for widening the language of “particular social group” to help meet the struggles of the specific conflicts that the world faces today.</p>

<p>“Nobody would be able to predict what forms persecution would take in the future, so the authors of the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 protocol purposely designed a definition that would adapt to changing modern reality,” said Stephen Legomsky, the chief counsel of USCIS from 2011 to 2013. He favors expanding the “particular social group” language to fit people fleeing gender-based violence in countries that don’t have adequate legal systems to protect women and LGBT communities, and some people trying to escape gangs.</p>

<p>But these kinds of steps seem unlikely under the current administration. As Bon Tempo, the historian, noted, refugee policy has always been “a product of politics, and controversial.”</p>

<p>“I try to caution people against falling into two traps: the ‘Statue of Liberty’ idea: “give us your poor, your wretched,” open-door image. And the other extreme, like what happens in the 1930s, where European Jews are facing persecution from the Nazis and America does largely shut its doors,” he said.</p>

<p>“The reason immigration politics gets so hot is because it basically is an exercise in self-definition: This is what the U.S. is. This is what we stand for. And there are a lot of different opinions on what the actual answers to those questions are.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t until President Jimmy Carter’s last year in office that the U.S. passed a formal law, the 1980 Refugee Act, to provide a permanent system for admitting refugees. This law was a product of the universal human rights activist movement of the 1960s and 1970s, a moment when nationalism was at an ebb. “It set up a mechanism where the United States can accept refugees from all over the world. In the decades prior, those admissions were much more targeted and limited,” said Carl Bon Tempo, a historian at SUNY Albany and the author of Americans at the Gate: The United States and Refugees during the Cold War.</p>

<p>The law created formal programs: for refugee resettlement from abroad, and for asylum-seekers who ask for protection once already inside the U.S.</p>

<p>On the simplest level, the law had two components: one that resettles refugees vetted abroad by the United Nations, and another to process asylum-seekers fleeing immediate danger who arrive in America first and then apply for protection.</p>

<p>If a person seeking protection makes it into the interior of the U.S. — often after first entering on a legal visa — they can file what is called an “affirmative” asylum application within one year. This means they’ll have an interview with a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officer in a non-adversarial setting. Less than a third of applicants are granted asylum in the interview stage. The rest are referred to immigration court.</p>

<p>If an asylum-seeker presents a claim at the border or is caught and ordered deported but expresses a “credible fear” of persecution in their home country, they can only file a “defensive” application — and then are sent straight to the immigration court system. Applicants have about a 50 percent chance of receiving asylum in the courts, though it varies widely by judge.</p>

<p>When Congress passed the 1980 Refugee Act, they didn’t anticipate how often it would be used.</p>

<p>“When asylum was first written into the Refugee Act, it was not viewed as the path that maybe tens of thousands of people, or even thousands of people, might claim annually as their way to get in,” said Bon Tempo. “It was seen as a legal pathway for someone to gain admission, but that very few will pursue.”</p>

<p>That’s not what happened. The introduction of the act coincided with civil wars in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua that triggered a large-scale migration. Asylum applications quickly rose. Over the years, the expansion of affordable travel has also meant that asylum-seekers from all over the world can more easily reach the U.S. on visas to find immediate safety and then apply for protection. The number of asylum applications has fluctuated over the years, but in 2014, it began to rise sharply, this time mostly from Central Americans trying to escape rampant gang violence their governments have been unable to control. Most of them arrived at the border and filed defensive asylum applications.</p>

<p>“Part of the problem with modern asylum procedure is you have so many people applying, many more than the system can actually handle,” Bon Tempo said.</p>

<p>Though the law hasn’t changed, the Trump administration has been reshaping the asylum system in other ways.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has promised to cut both legal and illegal immigration. A big piece of this effort is reframing the asylum system as a national security issue instead of a humanitarian program and characterizing asylum-seekers at the border as illegal entrants.</p>

<p>“Congress has so far refused to pass draconian legislation the administration wants that would cut off access to U.S. refugee protection,” said Eleanor Acer, the director of the refugee protection program at Human Rights First. “The administration is trying to do everything it can… to limit access to asylum and to rush people through the process, giving the appearance of due process while at the same time undercutting it.”</p>

<p>When asked about the criticism, a spokesperson from the Department of Justice said the reforms are “common sense” and “designed to increase efficiency and productivity in an immigration court system that has languished after years of neglect and failed leadership, and all are made while ensuring that due process is not compromised.”</p>

<p>Much of the administration’s efforts have been aimed at the asylum case backlog.</p>

<p>The recent spike in claims from Central Americans at the U.S.-Mexico border has contributed to an unprecedented backlog of more than 680,000 cases in immigration courts, more than double the number in 2013 (these include both defensive asylum cases and other types of immigration cases). There are also 300,000 affirmative cases waiting to be processed by USCIS, an increase of 1,750 percent over the last five years. Asylum-seekers often wait three to four years to have their cases heard, and the process can take even longer if they are initially denied and then appeal their cases. In 2016, the most current year of complete data available, 20,455 applicants were granted asylum and 11,643 were denied. In the same year, more than 180,000 new asylum applications were filed.</p>

<p>Some, like Sessions, worry that a backlog invites perverse incentives. Once asylum-seekers file an application, some are eligible to apply for a work permit if they have not received a decision after 180 days. (It usually takes 240 days to actually get a work permit.) If their cases take years to be reviewed, that means they may spend all that time working and establishing themselves in the U.S., and eventually can apply for another form of legal residency.</p>

<p>Though Sessions argues there is “rampant fraud” in the asylum system, there is no clear evidence to quantify how widespread the problem is.</p>

<p>Experts say fraud does not define the system.</p>

<p>“We do a really good job of handling asylum fraud,” said a current USCIS asylum officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Even if someone manages to get a benefit in the short term, we always come back and get them. We do asylum terminations if we find evidence.” Examples include identifying rehearsed stories that are repeated over and over, or catching misrepresentations, like African men who claim persecution because they are gay, but later file for a wife’s residency papers.</p>

<p>Many asylum-seekers with legal representation also undergo physical and psychological evaluations to help support their case, and sometimes country experts are called to assess an asylum-seeker’s story. The Executive Office of Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts, also has a Law Library and Immigration Research Center to keep up-to-date on human rights conditions in different countries.</p>

<p>Most immigration experts say outright fraud is rare. Even though many asylum cases are rejected, they are usually filed by people in good faith with legitimate fears, but who may not fit a narrow interpretation of asylum law.</p>

<p>Other false claims, as Javad Khazeli, a former ICE prosecutor from 2003 to 2010 explained, can be attributed to immigration scams. Over the years, he saw cases of immigrants duped by what’s known as a “notario” — people who falsely market themselves as qualified to give legal advice. These non-attorneys sometimes promise undocumented immigrants they can help them obtain a work permit, and instead file an asylum claim on their behalf. The person gets a work permit while they’re waiting, and then are surprised and confused when their case comes up, Khazeli, now an immigration lawyer, said.</p>

<p>But he questioned trying to paint the asylum system as rife with false claims. “One of the driving forces of the small percentage of fraudulent cases are notarios, sure,” he said. “How do you put notarios out of business? You make sure people have access to good legal services.”</p>

<p>Advocates say there’s a problem with the system that needs to be addressed: The government should provide asylum-seekers with lawyers, since the cases often involve life or death stakes.</p>

<p>This was a solution favored by many experts ProPublica spoke with. While asylum-seekers have the right to find legal representation, they are not entitled to a free lawyer. Applicants have legal counsel in only 37 percent of cases that go through immigration courts. Asylum-seekers held in detention in remote locations often have particular difficulty finding representation. This can make a big difference: 90 percent of applicants without representation had their cases denied in 2016, versus nearly 50 percent of applicants with lawyers.</p>

<p>“These are death penalty cases — you fear you'll be killed if you are sent back and you don't even have an attorney,” said Karen Musalo, the director of the Center for Gender &amp; Refugee Studies at University of California Hastings. Even children are not guaranteed legal representation. Yet, studies have shown that children who have access to legal counsel are far more likely to show up for their hearing than those who don’t.</p>

<p>Though it’s difficult to estimate how much it would cost the federal government to provide legal counsel to every applicant in immigration court, a few studies have tried to put a number on it: A 2014 economic analysis estimated that such a program would largely be offset by reduced detention costs, and cost $4 million extra a year. A study from 2016 that focused on California estimated each immigration case would cost $5,000 in legal fees.</p>

<p>Instead, the Justice Department seems to have made it even more difficult for asylum-seekers to access legal counsel.</p>

<p>This month, Sessions announced the department would temporarily halt a know-your-rights and pro-bono legal program and telephone help-line that serves nearly 50,000 detained immigrants per year, in order to assess effectiveness and costs. The program costs $6 million annually.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we pay enough attention to our immigration court system,” said Manjarrez, the former Border Patrol agent. Lawyers who are familiar with complicated immigration law can also help make sure asylum claims are clear and well-documented, saving time, he said. “If checks are being cut and I'm the Border Patrol guy, and they say, 'We’ll give you more agents and more wall,’ I‘d say, ‘No -- send it to the immigration courts.’ It’ll help us in the long term, because they'll help the flow and start to slow detentions.”</p>

<p>The immigration court system has made progress in hiring new judges since Trump took office, putting the total at 334. But more than 100 positions are still vacant and advocates estimate it would take around 200 extra judges to tackle the backlog.</p>

<p>Another short-term tactic to stem the backlog and limit fraud is to process newer asylum cases more quickly. In March, USCIS announced a new policy: Instead of processing affirmative asylum claims on a chronological basis, they’ll now switch to handling the newest claims first. Lawyers are alarmed that clients with strong asylum claims who have been waiting for years to move on with their lives will now be put on hold indefinitely. “I think that’s going to have a devastating impact,” said Jaya Ramji-Nogales, a law professor at Temple University and the author of Refugee Roulette. “If their claim was granted, they could bring their family over and regularize their family’s status here. Now they’ll be stuck in limbo.”</p>

<p>But Meissner saw the measure as a pragmatic step to restore faith in the system and get asylum claims processed in a timely manner again. She said during her time leading the INS, the precursor to USCIS, she faced the challenge of reducing a backlog of more than 400,000 cases in 1994. INS instituted a similar last-in, first-out system and made asylum-seekers wait six months to get a work permit instead of as soon as they filed an application. The changes yielded results: new claims slowed and approvals went up. “These are tough decisions,” she said. “What you want to do is set up the system that makes it possible to do the job and curb the possibility of abuses.”</p>

<p>More worrisome to some are new policies aimed at the courts. </p>

<p>Sessions has broad authority over immigration courts because they operate under the U.S. Department of Justice. This means he has the power to select immigration judges, overturn Board of Immigration Appeals decisions, and decide precedents, all with little oversight.</p>

<p>In April, the Justice Department introduced a quota system on immigration judges tied to their job performance ratings. The new rule requires judges to process at least 700 cases a year (they usually process an average of 678) to earn a satisfactory grade. Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said such a change would damage the court’s credibility. “Quotas and deadlines that have been announced are, frankly, unreasonable,” she said. “The very concept is in conflict with the independent decision-making authority of judges.”</p>

<p>Last year, the Justice Department also released a memo encouraging immigration judges to “carefully consider administrative efficiency” before granting continuance requests, which allow asylum-seekers extra time to find legal representation or gather necessary documents. The memo cited a 2012 DOJ Inspector General report that found that “frequent and lengthy continuances” were a significant factor in increased case processing times and that over half of all cases surveyed had one or more continuances.</p>

<p>Lawyers predicted these new policies may actually increase the immigration court backlog because rushed asylum hearings would result in more lawyers appealing cases, arguing that due process was violated.</p>

<p>Recent changes aren’t just about speeding up asylum decisions and deportations.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Trump often decried what he called “catch and release” -- processing asylum-seekers with an initial screening at the border, and then releasing them on bond until their court date. His administration has begun detaining almost all defensive asylum-seekers coming through the border until their cases are heard, arguing that this is a necessary step to ensure the immigrants don’t melt away and miss their hearings.</p>

<p>But lawyers see the expansion of detention as an effort to deter asylum-seekers from continuing with their claims — which contravenes international law. “Our detention system is unique in the way that it is truly prison-like, even though we recognize that asylum is not part of the criminal justice process,” said Denise Gilman, a law professor who runs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas. Keeping asylum-seekers locked up for months or even years when they’ve committed no crime further traumatizes people already suffering, she said. Some simply give up and accept deportation in order to leave detention.</p>

<p>Sessions has also indicated plans to make it even more difficult for some types of asylum cases to qualify for protection. In March, he referred two major Board of Immigration Appeals cases to himself. In one, he vacated a ruling that held asylum applicants have the right to a full hearing before a judge, an effort to cut off asylum-seekers who spend years trying to appeal denied cases or who have cases that, on paper, look unlikely to succeed. Advocates worry the decision may be used to summarily deport asylum-seekers who face language barriers or have difficulty documenting their asylum claims, especially those without legal counsel.</p>

<p>In the other case, he is reviewing whether victims of “private crime” – in this case, domestic violence – can qualify for asylum. Experts predict the decision may also be used to prevent most Central Americans fleeing gang violence from receiving asylum.</p>

<p>Gang violence and domestic abuse fall under the most flexible of the five asylum categories: “membership in a particular social group.” This has been a controversial category for years, lawyers said, because it does not have a clear definition. In parts of Central America, people don’t face outright war, “but high levels of civil violence, often combined with an inability of the government to protect its people,” said Leon Rodriguez, director of USCIS from 2013 to 2017. “The upshot is that you have a lot of people who are pretty scared, and in a lot of cases, are really at risk of dying violently when returning to countries, but it doesn’t fit into the traditional definition of asylum and refugee status.”</p>

<p>Some judges regularly accept the “particular social group” categorization for women facing gender-based violence; others rarely do. In recent years, gang violence in Central America has risen to an unprecedented level and pushed countless people to flee for their lives, but the courts still only recognize Central Americans claiming gang persecution as legitimate asylum-seekers in narrow cases – around 80 percent of asylum claims from Central America were denied in immigration court in 2016.</p>

<p>While Sessions’ decision on the issue, expected in May, may narrow the definition to exclude almost all Central American claims, advocates have long argued for widening the language of “particular social group” to help meet the struggles of the specific conflicts that the world faces today.</p>

<p>“Nobody would be able to predict what forms persecution would take in the future, so the authors of the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 protocol purposely designed a definition that would adapt to changing modern reality,” said Stephen Legomsky, the chief counsel of USCIS from 2011 to 2013. He favors expanding the “particular social group” language to fit people fleeing gender-based violence in countries that don’t have adequate legal systems to protect women and LGBT communities, and some people trying to escape gangs.</p>

<p>But these kinds of steps seem unlikely under the current administration. As Bon Tempo, the historian, noted, refugee policy has always been “a product of politics, and controversial.”</p>

<p>“I try to caution people against falling into two traps: the ‘Statue of Liberty’ idea: “give us your poor, your wretched,” open-door image. And the other extreme, like what happens in the 1930s, where European Jews are facing persecution from the Nazis and America does largely shut its doors,” he said.</p>

<p>“The reason immigration politics gets so hot is because it basically is an exercise in self-definition: This is what the U.S. is. This is what we stand for. And there are a lot of different opinions on what the actual answers to those questions are.”</p>

<p>How Asylum Works</p>

<p>How Asylum Works — and Doesn’t Work</p>

<p>Follow the path of immigrants fleeing violence or persecution, and get a glimpse into the complicated, evolving system designed to grant them refuge in the United States.</p>

<p>Years-long wait lists, bewildering legal arguments, an extended stay in detention — you can experience it all in the Waiting Game, a newsgame that simulates the experience of trying to seek asylum in the United States. The game was created by ProPublica, Playmatics and WNYC. Based on the true stories of real asylum-seekers, this interactive portal allows users to follow in the footsteps of five people fleeing persecution and trying to take refuge in America.</p>

<p>The process can be exhausting and feel arbitrary – and as you’ll find in the game, it involves a lot of waiting. Once asylum-seekers reach America, they must condense complex and often traumatic stories into short, digestible narratives they will tell again and again. Their lives often depend on their ability to convince a judge that they are in danger. Judicial decisions are so inconsistent across the country, success in complicated cases can come down to geography and luck -- in New York City only 17 percent of asylum cases are denied in immigration court; in Atlanta, 94 percent are. Increasingly, many asylum-seekers are held in detention for months or even years while going through the system. The immigration detention system costs more than $2 billion per year to maintain.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has tried to reframe the asylum system as a national security threat and a magnet for illegal immigration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions characterizes the American asylum process as “subject to rampant abuse” and “overloaded with fake claims.” He has aimed recent reforms at expediting asylum adjudications to speed up deportations and at making it more difficult for certain groups to qualify for protection, such as Central Americans who claim to fear gender-based violence or gang persecution.</p>

<p>The narrative that the system is overrun with fraud has long been pushed by groups that favor limiting immigration overall. They point to some 37 percent of asylum-seekers who annually miss their immigration hearings as evidence that people without legitimate fears of persecution game the system. They argue that allowing asylum-seekers to obtain work permits while they wait for a decision on their cases — which sometimes takes years — incentivizes baseless claims.</p>

<p>But another picture emerged when ProPublica spoke with more than 20 experts and stakeholders who study and work in the asylum system, including lawyers, immigration judges, historians, policy experts, an asylum officer, a former border patrol agent and a former ICE prosecutor.</p>

<p>When asked about changes to the system they’d like to see, many suggested providing asylum-seekers with better access to lawyers to support due process, expanding the definition of a refugee to cover modern-day conflicts,providing more resources to help the system process claims in a timely manner, and improving judicial independence by moving immigration courts out of the Department of Justice.</p>

<p>Most acknowledged some level of asylum-claim abuse exists. “In any system, of course, there are going to be some bad actors and some weaknesses people seek to exploit,” said Doris Meissner, the former commissioner of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1993 to 2000.</p>

<p>But they also argued for the importance of protecting and improving a national program that has provided refuge to hundreds of thousands of people. “If you are going to make a mistake in the immigration area, make this mistake,” said Bill Hing, director of the University of San Francisco’s Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic. “Protect people that may not need protecting, but don’t make the mistake of not protecting people who need it.”</p>

<p>Victor Manjarrez, a former border patrol agent from the 1980s until 2011, said he had seen human smuggling networks exploit the border over the years, but also many people who genuinely needed help.</p>

<p>“We have a system that's not perfect, but is designed to take refugees. That is the beauty of it,” he said. “It has a lot of issues, but we have something in place that is designed to be compassionate. And that’s why we have such a big political debate about this.”</p>

<p>The asylum system was created in the wake of the U.S. and other countries’ refusal to let in Jewish refugees during the Holocaust.</p>

<p>World War II sparked our current asylum and refugee policy. During the war, safe countries like the United States largely shut their doors to Jewish refugees, citing national security concerns. In one notorious example, the U.S. turned away a boat of nearly 1,000 Jews escaping Nazi Germany in 1939. More than a quarter of the ship’s refugees eventually were killed in Europe during the Holocaust.</p>

<p>After the war, the international community attempted to create a more orderly system for aiding people in danger. This resulted in the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention and its 1967 protocol, which defined a refugee as a person fleeing persecution based on “race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.” The convention included an article prohibiting countries from penalizing refugees for entering a foreign country illegally as long as “they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.” It also obligated signatories not to return any asylum-seekers to countries where their lives or freedom would be threatened.</p>

<p>The U.S. signed on, but initially dealt with refugee crises on a case-by-case basis, usually tied to foreign policy objectives. Early major refugee programs addressed people fleeing Communist countries, including the resettlement of Hungarian refugees after the 1956 revolution, the Vietnamese resettlement program after the Vietnam War, and refugee boat lifts after the Cuban revolution.</p>

<p>The U.S.’ current system to accept refugees wasn’t created until decades later.</p>

In March, USCIS announced a new policy: Instead of processing affirmative asylum claims on a chronological basis, they’ll now switch to handling the newest claims first. Lawyers are alarmed that clients with strong asylum claims who have been waiting for years to move on with their lives will now be put on hold indefinitely. “I think that’s going to have a devastating impact,” said Jaya Ramji-Nogales, a law professor at Temple University and the author of Refugee Roulette. “If their claim was granted, they could bring their family over and regularize their family’s status here. Now they’ll be stuck in limbo.”</p>

<p>But Meissner saw the measure as a pragmatic step to restore faith in the system and get asylum claims processed in a timely manner again. She said during her time leading the INS, the precursor to USCIS, she faced the challenge of reducing a backlog of more than 400,000 cases in 1994. INS instituted a similar last-in, first-out system and made asylum-seekers wait six months to get a work permit instead of as soon as they filed an application. The changes yielded results: new claims slowed and approvals went up. “These are tough decisions,” she said. “What you want to do is set up the system that makes it possible to do the job and curb the possibility of abuses.”</p>

<p>More worrisome to some are new policies aimed at the courts. </p>

<p>Sessions has broad authority over immigration courts because they operate under the U.S. Department of Justice. This means he has the power to select immigration judges, overturn Board of Immigration Appeals decisions, and decide precedents, all with little oversight.</p>

<p>In April, the Justice Department introduced a quota system on immigration judges tied to their job performance ratings. The new rule requires judges to process at least 700 cases a year (they usually process an average of 678) to earn a satisfactory grade. Judge A. Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges, said such a change would damage the court’s credibility. “Quotas and deadlines that have been announced are, frankly, unreasonable,” she said. “The very concept is in conflict with the independent decision-making authority of judges.”</p>

<p>Last year, the Justice Department also released a memo encouraging immigration judges to “carefully consider administrative efficiency” before granting continuance requests, which allow asylum-seekers extra time to find legal representation or gather necessary documents. The memo cited a 2012 DOJ Inspector General report that found that “frequent and lengthy continuances” were a significant factor in increased case processing times and that over half of all cases surveyed had one or more continuances.</p>

<p>Lawyers predicted these new policies may actually increase the immigration court backlog because rushed asylum hearings would result in more lawyers appealing cases, arguing that due process was violated.</p>

<p>Recent changes aren’t just about speeding up asylum decisions and deportations.</p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Trump often decried what he called “catch and release” -- processing asylum-seekers with an initial screening at the border, and then releasing them on bond until their court date. His administration has begun detaining almost all defensive asylum-seekers coming through the border until their cases are heard, arguing that this is a necessary step to ensure the immigrants don’t melt away and miss their hearings.</p>

<p>But lawyers see the expansion of detention as an effort to deter asylum-seekers from continuing with their claims — which contravenes international law. “Our detention system is unique in the way that it is truly prison-like, even though we recognize that asylum is not part of the criminal justice process,” said Denise Gilman, a law professor who runs the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas. Keeping asylum-seekers locked up for months or even years when they’ve committed no crime further traumatizes people already suffering, she said. Some simply give up and accept deportation in order to leave detention.</p>

<p>Sessions has also indicated plans to make it even more difficult for some types of asylum cases to qualify for protection. In March, he referred two major Board of Immigration Appeals cases to himself. In one, he vacated a ruling that held asylum applicants have the right to a full hearing before a judge, an effort to cut off asylum-seekers who spend years trying to appeal denied cases or who have cases that, on paper, look unlikely to succeed. Advocates worry the decision may be used to summarily deport asylum-seekers who face language barriers or have difficulty documenting their asylum claims, especially those without legal counsel.</p>

<p>In the other case, he is reviewing whether victims of “private crime” – in this case, domestic violence – can qualify for asylum. Experts predict the decision may also be used to prevent most Central Americans fleeing gang violence from receiving asylum.</p>

<p>Gang violence and domestic abuse fall under the most flexible of the five asylum categories: “membership in a particular social group.” This has been a controversial category for years, lawyers said, because it does not have a clear definition. In parts of Central America, people don’t face outright war, “but high levels of civil violence, often combined with an inability of the government to protect its people,” said Leon Rodriguez, director of USCIS from 2013 to 2017. “The upshot is that you have a lot of people who are pretty scared, and in a lot of cases, are really at risk of dying violently when returning to countries, but it doesn’t fit into the traditional definition of asylum and refugee status.”</p>

<p>Some judges regularly accept the “particular social group” categorization for women facing gender-based violence; others rarely do. In recent years, gang violence in Central America has risen to an unprecedented level and pushed countless people to flee for their lives, but the courts still only recognize Central Americans claiming gang persecution as legitimate asylum-seekers in narrow cases – around 80 percent of asylum claims from Central America were denied in immigration court in 2016.</p>

<p>While Sessions’ decision on the issue, expected in May, may narrow the definition to exclude almost all Central American claims, advocates have long argued for widening the language of “particular social group” to help meet the struggles of the specific conflicts that the world faces today.</p>

<p>“Nobody would be able to predict what forms persecution would take in the future, so the authors of the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 protocol purposely designed a definition that would adapt to changing modern reality,” said Stephen Legomsky, the chief counsel of USCIS from 2011 to 2013. He favors expanding the “particular social group” language to fit people fleeing gender-based violence in countries that don’t have adequate legal systems to protect women and LGBT communities, and some people trying to escape gangs.</p>

<p>But these kinds of steps seem unlikely under the current administration. As Bon Tempo, the historian, noted, refugee policy has always been “a product of politics, and controversial.”</p>

<p>“I try to caution people against falling into two traps: the ‘Statue of Liberty’ idea: “give us your poor, your wretched,” open-door image. And the other extreme, like what happens in the 1930s, where European Jews are facing persecution from the Nazis and America does largely shut its doors,” he said.</p>

<p>“The reason immigration politics gets so hot is because it basically is an exercise in self-definition: This is what the U.S. is. This is what we stand for. And there are a lot of different opinions on what the actual answers to those questions are.”</p>

<p>After an incident at Arthur L. Davila Middle School last October, Trah’Vaeziah Jackson, 13, was arrested and sent to juvenile detention for three days.</p>

<p>Beside a highway in Bryan, Texas, tucked between a motorcycle bar and the county jail, stands a low-slung, sprawling complex with tinted windows, sandstone walls and barbed wire lining parts of its roof. A roadside sign identifies it as the Brazos County Juvenile Justice Center.</p>

<p>One Friday afternoon last October, after an incident at nearby Arthur L. Davila Middle School, a police officer arrested 13-year-old Trah’Vaeziah Jackson and brought her to the juvenile detention facility. She cried as employees patted her down, cut off her hair extensions, and took her photo and fingerprints. She was served dinner — chicken nuggets, mashed potatoes and an apple in a styrofoam box with a carton of milk — but had no appetite.</p>

<p>In the shower room, guards applied thick anti-lice shampoo to Trah’Vaeziah’s hair. As she washed and combed it, clumps fell out. Afterwards, she reluctantly changed from her school clothes, a T-shirt and jeans, into the detention uniform, an orange shirt with matching shorts. Then she was locked in her cell, which contained a sink, a toilet, and, instead of a bed, a stuffed blue mat atop a brick base. High on the wall was a sliver of a window, but she wasn’t tall enough to see outside.</p>

<p>Only after 8 p.m. was she permitted a phone call. She called her mother and sobbed into the receiver. How could this accident have turned into a jail sentence?</p>

<p>Three decades ago, schools across the country began bolstering discipline to deter juvenile crime. Zero-tolerance policies were introduced, school law enforcement budgets swelled and suspensions, expulsions and student arrests multiplied.</p>

<p>These punishments, though, are applied unequally. Across the country, hundreds of thousands of students of color, like Trah’Vaeziah, bear the brunt. Black students are almost four times as likely to receive an out-of-school suspension and twice as likely to be arrested as their white peers, according to federal data. The pattern starts early: Even black preschool students are more than three times as likely as their white peers to be suspended from school.</p>

<p>Harsh discipline can backfire, especially when meted out arbitrarily. It may reinforce bad behavior, or encourage students to drop out, creating what sociologists call the “school-to-prison-pipeline.” A suspension increases the likelihood of dropping out by 77 percent, and the incarceration rate of high school dropouts is 63 times higher than that of college graduates, studies show.</p>

<p>“There’s no doubt that as we’ve escalated security and punishment strategies within schools over the past 25 years that this has had a disparate impact on youth of color,” said Aaron Kupchik, a sociology and criminal justice professor at the University of Delaware. “They are more likely to be seen as problematic, and to be policed and disciplined in schools even when they show similar behaviors as white students.”</p>

<p>Flooded with about 1,500 complaints related to racial discrimination in school discipline between 2011 and 2017, the Obama administration made the issue a priority. Relying on the doctrine of “disparate impact,” which emerged in the 1970s and holds that differential treatment by race amounts to discrimination whether or not there is overt or intentional bias, the Department of Education opened sweeping investigations into disciplinary disparities, from large school districts such as Minneapolis and Oakland to smaller ones like Bryan, Texas, where Trah’Vaeziah goes to school. It pushed investigators in its regional offices to broaden probes of individual incidents to look for systemic discrimination.</p>

<p>But under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Trump administration is taking a more hands-off approach. DeVos has indicated that she may soon reverse Obama-era guidelines on disparate impact and school discipline, and her hires have signaled this policy shift. Kenneth Marcus, tapped to lead the civil rights office, has argued that disparate impact analysis has significant legal limitations. And Hans Bader, an attorney adviser at the department, has accused the Obama administration of using disparate impact to create “racial quotas.” DeVos is also decentralizing decision-making, giving regional offices more control over investigations.</p>

<p>Quietly, the pullback is already happening. In a June 2017 internal memo leaked to ProPublica, one of DeVos’ top officials ordered investigators to limit proactive civil rights probes rather than expanding them to identify systemic patterns, as the Obama administration had often done in school discipline cases.</p>

<p>Since then, the Education Department has closed at least 65 school discipline investigations opened under Obama, including the Bryan probe, without any mandated reforms, according to an analysis of federal data received by ProPublica through a records request. In at least 50 cases, the department attributed the shutdowns to “moot” allegations or insufficient evidence or details. That was its explanation for letting Bryan off the hook, even though federal investigators there had uncovered numerous examples of black students being punished more harshly than whites for the same offenses.</p>

<p>While the Education Department didn’t respond to ProPublica’s questions about the Bryan case and disparities in school discipline, it has said that the goal of narrowing civil rights investigations is to speed them up.</p>

<p>“Justice delayed is justice denied,” spokeswoman Elizabeth Hill said last month. “OCR seeks to investigate and resolve complaints in a more timely and efficient manner so that OCR enforcement of civil rights laws remains meaningful and relevant to students, advocates, and schools.”</p>

<p>Christie Whitbeck, Bryan’s superintendent of schools, said that the district “fully complied” with the civil rights investigation, which was “closed with no findings of discrimination on the district’s part.”</p>

<p>She said that the district plans to address the racial gap in school discipline in the next school year, and is hiring additional support staff. “As with school districts across the country, we face various challenges regarding student discipline,” Whitbeck said. “Going forward, we will continue to proactively monitor our discipline data, implement positive discipline interventions and character education programs.”</p>

<p>Arthur L. Davila Middle School in Bryan, Texas, a district where black students are almost four times as likely to be suspended as their white peers.</p>

<p>In the mid-19th century, the town of Bryan emerged from a railroad stop serving a community of small farms and a few cotton plantations in the fertile Brazos Valley, 100 miles northwest of Houston. Its agricultural economy originally depended on slavery, and racial segregation and discrimination have characterized the town’s history.</p>

<p>After the Supreme Court ordered schools to desegregate in 1954, integration in Bryan floundered, prompting a black parent to file a federal lawsuit. Despite initial objections from Bryan’s school board, a court sided with the family in 1963, and ordered Bryan to desegregate one grade per year. In 1965, however, the Department of Justice reviewed Bryan’s fledgling integration plan and found that it did not meet national standards.</p>

<p>The DOJ ordered the district to immediately implement a “freedom of choice” plan, allowing all students —regardless of grade and race — to go to whichever school they wanted. By 1970, hundreds of black students had opted into schools where most students were white, but few white students had chosen to attend schools where most students were black. It wasn’t until the following year, when a new high school opened, that integration truly occurred.</p>

<p>Almost half a century later, discrimination in Bryan takes a different form. Black students are almost four times as likely to be suspended or referred to a disciplinary school as their white peers, according to district data. And black students were also four times more likely to receive tickets in school for minor offenses, such as disrupting class or profanity, according to an analysis of data from 2011. Between 2011 and 2014, black students, who account for about 20 percent of total enrollment, accounted for more than 60 percent of arrests in school.</p>

<p>“For the kids who are being ticketed, arrested, suspended or expelled — who are predominantly black — it tells them that they don’t belong in our public schools, which is a travesty,” said Deborah Fowler, executive director of Texas Appleseed, a social justice advocacy group that spent years examining disciplinary data in Bryan and statewide. “For the students that remain in the classroom and see their peers treated this way, they internalize unhealthy and harmful messages about what that means. That’s the way that implicit bias is formed and gets reinforced.”</p>

<p>Over-represented in punishments, Bryan’s students of color are under-represented in pathways to academic honors and higher education. As of the 2015-2016 school year, black students represented fewer than 10 percent of students in the gifted and talented program, whereas their white peers, who comprised less than a quarter of the district’s total enrollment, accounted for almost 50 percent of students in the gifted program. Only 9 percent of the students taking eighth-grade algebra were black, while 41 percent were white, according to district data obtained by Texas Appleseed.</p>

<p>In 2010, an African-American newcomer to Bryan challenged the disciplinary divide. Marjorie Holmon, who had just moved her family to Texas from Maryland a few weeks before, was dumbfounded when her 12-year-old son, De’Angelo, came home from school with a misdemeanor ticket.</p>

<p>Marjorie Holmon holds a picture of her son, De’Angelo, when he was 12. After he was punished in school, her complaint prompted a now-scuttled federal investigation of racial disparities in student discipline.</p>

<p>Holmon had encouraged De’Angelo, who was being bullied by a classmate, to tell his teacher about it. But when he did, the teacher rebuked him, saying, “Here in middle school, we don’t tattle,” according to Holmon.</p>

<p>Without the teacher’s support, De’Angelo defended himself when his classmate struck him. Under the school’s zero-tolerance approach, both boys received Class C misdemeanor tickets from the school’s police officer. To resolve the ticket, De’Angelo would have to appear in adult criminal court, which could result in fines of up to $500, community service hours and behavior-management courses.</p>

<p>When Holmon arrived at the courthouse and looked around, she recalled, “It was only black and Hispanic students. You only saw one or two Caucasian students. That shined a light for me.”</p>

<p>Holmon reached out to Texas Appleseed and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which helped her file a complaint with the Department of Education in February 2013.</p>

<p>“This thing was bigger than De’Angelo, and we were going to fight for every kid,” Holmon said.</p>

<p>In 2014, 19 months after Holmon’s complaint, another black family — also destined to confront the school district’s uneven justice — showed up in Bryan. With her four children, including Trah’Vaeziah, Yvola Polk moved from Midland, 400 miles away, into a trailer down the street from her sister, who had breast cancer.</p>

<p>“Going through the radiation and chemo, I knew she was going to need me here,” Polk said in a February interview in the kitchen of her trailer, which was illuminated by a dim winter light that filtered through a small window. Two inspirational plaques adorned the otherwise bare walls. She had learned to remove all the light bulbs in her home during the day; otherwise, her 18-year-old son James, who has autism and epilepsy, would attempt to pull them out of their sockets.</p>

<p>For Polk, taking care of James is a full-time job. She administers his medications three times a day and has to watch him constantly. “He just likes to throw stuff, mess with stuff and his hands — he has octopus hands,” said Polk, who blockades her fridge with duct tape or a table to deter James from eating the family’s sandwich meats and cheese.</p>

<p>Trah’Vaeziah required a different kind of support. As a sixth-grader at Davila Middle School, a sandstone building that resembles the detention center five miles away, Trah’Vaeziah was repeatedly victimized, she and her mother said.</p>

<p>After each incident, Polk visited the school, leaving James with another adult. Every time, administrators assured her that the bullying would stop, but they didn’t follow through, she said. Finally, she gave them a tongue lashing, threatening to sit outside the school every day if there was no other way to assure her daughter’s safety.</p>

<p>Trah’Vaeziah at home with her mother, Yvola Polk. Polk has repeatedly complained to school administrators about her daughter’s treatment.</p>

<p>Later that day, school police officer Bryan Ruebush showed up at her house. Even though he hadn’t been present at her outburst, he wrote her a warning citation for trespassing on school property. According to Kelley McKethan, a spokeswoman for the Bryan Police Department, the school requested that Polk receive a warning for a “veiled threat she made against other students to school staff.”</p>

<p>The bullying subsided as Trah’Vaeziah reached seventh grade, in which she took a course called “Texas Success.” Her class competed with other classes to see which one could do the best job painting popsicle sticks and decorating its hallway door with them. Trah’Vaeziah and other students covered their sticks with glue from a hot-glue gun plugged into a classroom wall, she said.</p>

<p>With the teacher in the classroom, out of sight of the students in the hallway, horseplay ensued. As one of Trah’Vaeziah’s classmates headed to the bathroom, she recalled, she playfully gestured that she might touch him with the gluey stick. He dodged her. But on his way back, she again jokingly waved the stick toward him and accidentally grazed his arm, leaving him with a two-inch burn, she said. She immediately apologized — she had only meant to tease him. The school nurse bandaged his arm.</p>

<p>According to a school disciplinary report, Trah’Vaeziah “took a hot glue gun and burned another student severely on the arm with it.” But Polk, who has watched the hallway surveillance video, said it only showed Trah’Vaeziah with a popsicle stick. It also showed that the teacher, a 2012 college graduate with four-and-a-half years of teaching experience, wasn’t supervising the children, Polk said. “If the teacher would have been watching her, this would’ve never happened in the first place.” The district did not respond to ProPublica’s request to view the surveillance video, and would not respond to questions on the incident, citing confidentiality of personnel matters and discipline of individual students.</p>

<p>The family of the boy declined to press charges against Trah’Vaeziah, according to one of the boy’s relatives, who requested not to be named. Contradicting the school’s report, the relative agreed with Polk that Trah’Vaeziah had touched the boy’s skin with a popsicle stick, not a glue gun. She added that the youth, who is a student of color, was himself unfairly pegged at the school as a troublemaker.</p>

<p>Trah’Vaeziah had rarely been in trouble at school, though the day before she had been isolated in a separate room from her classmates as an in-school suspension for mouthing off to a teacher in the cafeteria during breakfast. Now she was summoned to the assistant principal’s office, where she was met by Ruebush, the same school police officer who had cited her mother. Glancing anxiously at the clock, she wondered aloud whether she would miss the school bus home.</p>

<p>“You’re not going home,” she said Ruebush told her. “You’re going to juvy.”</p>

<p>The stark disparities revealed in Holmon’s complaint attracted national media attention. Under pressure from local advocates, Texas passed legislation in late 2013 that weakened school police officers’ ability to ticket students.</p>

<p>While the new law reduced ticketing, the Bryan district compensated by stepping up other forms of discipline. As of 2016, in-school suspensions were up nearly 22 percent from 2013, amounting to two punishments for every five students in the district, according to district data. And referrals to the district’s alternative school for misbehaving students were on the rise as well.</p>

<p>“It’s not as though the discrimination disappears once the practice of ticketing is ultimately eliminated,” said Fowler of Texas Appleseed. “There’s something systemic happening that needs to be addressed regardless of whether or not students are still being ticketed.”</p>

<p>Deborah Fowler, executive director of advocacy group Texas Appleseed, has spent years examining school disciplinary data in Bryan and statewide.</p>

<p>Following the ticketing reform, in March 2014, the federal Education Department sought more information from the district on all forms of school discipline. The decision to conduct a broad investigation came from headquarters, where the Bryan case was a top priority. Local advocates were concerned, however, that the regional civil rights office wasn’t as enthused about widening the scope of the probe.</p>

<p>“Bryan is one of the cases where the headquarters and the region had different visions about what the case was supposed to be,” said Seth Galanter, a former senior official in the Education Department’s civil rights office under Obama. He currently works for the National Center for Youth Law, which joined in the federal complaint against the Bryan School District.</p>

<p>Over the course of the investigation, federal investigators dug up at least 10 incidents where black students received harsher punishment than their white peers for similar conduct, according to documents obtained by ProPublica through a records request. For example, during the 2012-2013 school year, a black student at Davila, the school Trah’Vaeziah would later attend, received one day of in-school suspension for “failure to follow directives.” Earlier that year, a white student received just one hour of detention for the same offense.</p>

<p>For teachers, cooperating with the federal probe may have carried a risk. One African-American teacher, Evelyn Wallace, filed a complaint with the Education Department in 2015, alleging that the district decided not to renew her contract because she had given information to investigators the previous year. She told them that the district had a history of passing over her and other black teachers for promotions. She also provided names of black students whom she felt had been wrongly punished, and the dates of the incidents. The investigation into her retaliation complaint is ongoing.</p>

<p>Probe Found Several Instances of Discipline Inequity</p>

<p>Over the course of the investigation, federal investigators dug up at least 10 incidents where black students received harsher punishment than their white peers.</p>

<p>Federal investigators had uncovered numerous examples of black students being punished more harshly than whites for the same offenses in Bryan ISD. (p. 5)  View the entire document with DocumentCloud </p>

<p>“Most of the black students weren’t treated fairly,” said Wallace, who now is an adjunct English teacher at a community college in Houston. “There were some incidents with Caucasian students who were on the hook but walked away scot free,” whereas, “African-American students were sent to the juvenile detention.”</p>

<p>The wider mandate had one drawback; it extended the probe’s timeline. Even though federal investigations are supposed to close within the department’s stated goal of 180 days, the Bryan case lingered for years. In the meantime, Holmon and her family left Bryan. De’Angelo graduated from high school. And Donald Trump was elected president.</p>

<p>Perhaps recognizing that time was running short, federal investigators tried to negotiate a settlement with the school district. A February 2017 working draft of the proposed settlement, obtained by ProPublica through a records request, shows that the district would have agreed to take more than a dozen actions to reform its disciplinary system, including reviewing and revising its disciplinary policies, creating additional support services for punished students like mentoring, designating campus behavior coordinators, and educating parents on how to file complaints related to discipline and conducting annual school reviews.</p>

<p>If those reforms had been adopted, Trah’Vaeziah likely would not have been exiled to the detention center later that year. But the federal government and the district were unable to finalize the agreement.</p>

<p>Within months after Trump came into office, the tide changed. In June 2017, Candice Jackson, an attorney whom DeVos had named as interim assistant secretary for civil rights, drafted an internal memo that sharply reversed the Obama administration’s course. Federal investigators were no longer encouraged to look at complaints through a systemic lens.</p>

<p>Jackson, who had little experience in civil rights law and is best known for ushering Bill Clinton’s sexual misconduct accusers into the audience of the second presidential debate in October 2016, also gave regional offices greater autonomy. Under the Obama administration, regional bureaus often needed clearance from Washington to settle or close a case, especially those relating to school discipline. Jackson allowed regional offices to determine how to settle cases.</p>

<p>Some regional offices have been able to resolve disparate impact cases in favor of student complainants. This past February, a complaint filed in 2013 alleging discriminatory school discipline practices in Durham, North Carolina, was settled, requiring the district to develop a new disciplinary approach, hire a discipline supervisor and bolster data collection.</p>

<p>The Texas office took a different tack. Following the Jackson memo, it backpedaled on the Bryan investigation. Page Baird, a senior equal opportunity specialist in the Texas office, wrote to the Bryan complainants in late July 2017, informing them that the investigation no longer encompassed all forms of school discipline.</p>

<p>“OCR has revised the scope of its investigation of this complaint,” she wrote, adding that the probe would now be limited to police ticketing in Bryan’s schools.</p>

<p>Since ticketing in Bryan had subsided, the decision to disregard other forms of discipline was tantamount to ending the investigation. Taylor D. August, the director of Texas’s regional civil rights office, and chief civil rights attorney Angela Hights made it official in September 2017, notifying the complainants that there was “insufficient evidence to support a conclusion of noncompliance.”</p>

<p>The Brazos County Juvenile Justice Center in Bryan, Texas. Last October, after an incident at her middle school Trah’Vaeziah Jackson, 13, was arrested and held in the center for three days.</p>

<p>As Ruebush and Trah’Vaeziah left the middle school and headed to the detention facility on that Friday afternoon last October, she asked if she could call her mother, who would be worried when she didn’t come home on a bus. He said no, and told her to turn off her cellphone and put it, along with her identification card and pencils, in a brown bag. Instead, the assistant principal called Polk and informed her that her daughter had been arrested and transferred to the detention center.</p>

<p>Kelley McKethan, a spokeswoman for the Bryan Police Department, said she could not discuss the case because it involved a juvenile. Generally, assaults in which someone “intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly” causes an injury are handled by police “and the school has no say in whether a student is arrested or not,” she said. “Remember there are multiple sides to a story as well as evidence that is taken into consideration.”</p>

<p>McKethan added that “our agency and our officers are held to an extremely high standard. Any indication of racial bias is handled immediately and is not tolerated at any level.”</p>

<p>The next day, Polk made her way to the detention facility. She sat before a thick slab of glass in the visiting room, which was cramped and smelled of disinfectant. When her daughter appeared on the other side, she noticed that Trah’Vaeziah’s gregarious buoyancy had deflated, her eyes were inflamed from hours of crying and her thick, foot-long braids were gone. The detention center did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.</p>

<p>Polk tried to comfort her. “I’m going to try to do everything I can to get you out,” she told her daughter through a small speaker embedded inside the glass pane.</p>

<p>The center is supposed to hold hearings within 48 hours. But because the center’s courtroom is closed on weekends, Trah’Vaeziah’s hearing took place on Monday, three days after her arrest. The proceedings went swiftly. Judge Misty Swan, who was presiding over the juvenile court that morning, released Trah’Vaeziah from the detention facility on condition that she do 20 hours of community service and write an apology letter. She also stipulated that Trah’Vaeziah would have to keep a clean record until the next court date and couldn’t access social media, cellphones or cash. Any violation of the agreement would result in further detention.</p>

<p>“They want to give this harsh punishment for something that we could’ve easily resolved at the schoolhouse,” said Polk. “They’re taking it too far for a kid.”</p>

<p>Since entering the disciplinary school, Trah’Vaeziah’s grades have suffered. An official from the school informed Polk that if her daughter’s grades do not improve, she may have to repeat seventh grade.</p>

<p>Trah’Vaeziah faced further consequences. Days after her release, at a due process hearing at the school, she was sentenced to five weeks in the district’s disciplinary alternative school. When her mother appealed, the stint was reduced to about two weeks.</p>

<p>The disciplinary school epitomizes the district’s racial disparities. About 44 percent of students referred to the school are black, more than twice the district-wide proportion, according to 2016-17 district data.</p>

<p>For Trah’Vaeziah, the disciplinary school felt as institutional as the juvenile detention facility, except that she was able to start and end her days at home. Each morning, she put on the alternative school’s uniform: a cotton polo shirt tucked into khaki pants with an elastic waist.</p>

<p>As research has shown, juvenile arrests can increase student misconduct, perpetuating a disciplinary cycle as children begin to internalize a “criminal” label. Trah’Vaeziah was no exception. In January 2018, after a classmate pulled Trah’Vaeziah’s hair, provoking a scuffle, she was sent back to the disciplinary school, which she currently attends. The school emphasizes computer-based instruction, so Trah’Vaeziah and the other students receive minimal personal instruction from teachers. They mainly watch video lectures and complete lessons online.</p>

<p>Since entering the disciplinary school, Trah’Vaeziah’s grades have suffered. An official from the school informed Polk that if her daughter’s grades do not improve, she may have to repeat seventh grade. For black students in Texas, repeating a grade multiplies the chance of dropping out of school nearly six-fold, according to a recent study.</p>

<p>In late March, Polk filed complaints with the school district and with the civil rights office in Dallas. Soon afterwards, a truancy officer served Polk with a court summons. The officer informed her she was being cited for keeping her daughter out of school during the appeal of Trah’Vaeziah’s first disciplinary school referral —almost six months earlier.</p>

<p>Polk is fed up. “My child might grow up to be a doctor and save one of your kid’s lives, but the school system don’t see it like that,” she said. “It’s just a pattern, like, this one is in trouble, and this one going to be in trouble, and this one is going to be just like this one.”</p>

<p>by: Steve Mills</p>

<p>Ask ProPublica Illinois</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year, we asked ProPublica Illinois readers what they wanted to know about how we do our work. Thoughtful, challenging questions have been rolling in ever since, and we’ve been answering them in an occasional series of columns. In this dispatch, Deputy Editor Steve Mills answers a question about how journalists deal with sources.</p>

<p>I would like to know how journalists manage their sources in an ethical and responsible way. What do you do if you have a quote from someone, or information, that they do not want published? — Liz Main</p>

<p>Like any relationship, a reporter’s relationship with a source — especially a long-term source — takes some work. Good reporters check in with sources regularly, not just when they’re working on a deadline story and need information. They might get to know a little about their source’s family or their interests, and ask after them. They’re transparent, too. Reporters don’t lie to sources.</p>

<p>But there are boundaries. Reporters might get information from a source over lunch or a drink — the tab paid for by the news organization or split in half — but they do not otherwise socialize with sources. They don’t give them advice. I’ve written a lot about wrongly convicted inmates, and they’ve often asked me to recommend lawyers. I’ve always told them I can’t.</p>

<p>Reporters also let sources know that they and their editors — and not sources — decide what a story is and when it’s ready for publication. Even when sources give reporters what appears to be blockbuster information, they have to trust reporters to find the story, even if it turns out altogether different from what they anticipated.</p>

<p>It can be delicate and difficult. The relationship between reporters and their sources, especially those who provide regular tips and story ideas, is symbiotic. Reporters need stories. Sources want their perspectives heard.</p>

<p>What’s more, tensions can arise between reporters and their sources. Many sources have an agenda. That means reporters must be aware of that agenda and not let it color how a story is reported. They must also be willing to follow the facts wherever they lead, even if that means angering a source with a story that’s tough on them — even if that makes getting information from the source in the future more difficult.</p>

<p>Of course, squishy areas abound, in part because reporters deal with different kinds of sources. There are those — government officials and their spokespeople, for instance — who deal with reporters on an almost daily basis and, as a result, are more experienced. They are, in many cases, on guard when they deal with reporters, who often are trying to get information from them.</p>

<p>Then there are those who don’t often have any interactions with reporters — people we come across covering a fire or a parade or a crime, including victims or witnesses. They’re more vulnerable.</p>

<p>A good journalist explains to that kind of source the risks of cooperating with a story — either by being a source of information or a subject of a story. Journalism can be a sort of hit-and-run business: get information from the source, write the story, never talk to the source again. That approach can be a bit unkind, I think, and shortsighted. I keep in touch with some sources who haven’t provided me with information that led to a story in several years. You never know when they’ll have a story for you.</p>

<p>So, to your question: A reporter typically would not allow government officials or spokespeople to take back information they provided, or to revise their quotes. But that reporter might be more forgiving of someone who had never dealt with the media and said something deeply personal or something that’s not crucial to the story.</p>

<p>It’s easy to feel empathy for a source, particularly someone telling you about their misfortunes. My colleague Melissa Sanchez, in her story about ticket debt in Chicago driving some people into bankruptcy, felt deeply for the people she wrote about and their struggles, which were often heartbreaking.</p>

<p>But it didn’t stop her from delving into their backgrounds to make sure what they told her was true. That’s another thing: We background our sources, running their names through criminal and civil court databases. We need to know as much as possible about people we include in stories, both to gauge their credibility and to ensure that there aren’t surprises following publication.</p>

<p>Not that every negative detail we uncover leads to a person’s removal from a story. In some cases, those facts aren’t pertinent to the issue and, in the end, don’t affect the person’s credibility.</p>

<p>When Melissa found that one of the people she had interviewed for her story had been arrested several times, including shortly before the story was scheduled to be published, we felt her credibility had been diminished. She was no longer a reliable source. We cut her out of the story.</p>

<h2 id="howanoregonweeklyforcedreleaseofkeyrecordsinmurdercases">How an Oregon Weekly Forced Release of Key Records in Murder Cases</h2>

<p>by: Les Zaitz</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-25</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/how-an-oregon-weekly-forced-release-of-key-records-in-murder-cases </p>

<p>This article was produced in partnership with the Malheur Enterprise, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Decoster, special to ProPublica</p>

<p>Oregon records long considered confidential provide key insights into why the state’s judicial and mental health systems released a convicted killer they viewed as a clear danger to the public.</p>

<p>The more than 1,100 pages of records chronicle the treatment of Charles Longjaw after he was found criminally insane, as well as the state’s decisions to turn him free and his repeat trips to the Oregon State Hospital. Longjaw killed a homeless man on the streets of Portland shortly after he was released from state supervision.</p>

<p>The Oregon Psychiatric Security Review Board, the agency with jurisdiction over defendants found guilty except for insanity, provided Longjaw’s medical evaluation reports, risk assessments and doctors’ progress notes in response to a public-records request.</p>

<p>The board did so after giving up on a legal battle with the Malheur Enterprise a year ago over documents involving Anthony W. Montwheeler, another former state hospital patient.</p>

<p>Montwheeler, 50, is facing trial in Malheur County, in rural eastern Oregon, for aggravated murder, assault and kidnapping. He is charged with kidnapping an ex-wife and stabbing her to death outside an Ontario convenience store. He is accused of killing another man and seriously injuring his wife during what prosecutors say was a head-on collision as Montwheeler eluded police. The string of crimes happened on a snowy morning in January 2017.</p>

<p>Three weeks earlier, Montwheeler had been discharged from the state hospital by the state security review board. He contended that he had been faking mental illness for nearly 20 years to avoid prison in an earlier kidnapping case. Doctors at the state psychiatric hospital told the review board there was no evidence that Montwheeler suffered a mental illness that warranted his continued state custody.</p>

<p>Those details were unknown when the Malheur Enterprise, a 109-year-old weekly based in the county seat of Vale, set out to determine why Montwheeler was free. The security review board initially wouldn’t disclose anything. When pressed by the newspaper, the agency released its administrative orders dating back 20 years and an audio recording of the crucial hearing in 2016 at which Montwheeler was discharged.</p>

<p>The security review board then released some of the 200 exhibits it cited in releasing Montwheeler but declined to provide 15 key documents requested by the Enterprise. These included the hospital’s risk assessments, treatment progress notes and release plans. The review board, joined by the Oregon State Hospital, contested a petition the newspaper filed with the state’s attorney general seeking access to the records. The agencies insisted disclosing such records would invade Montwheeler’s privacy and violate laws relating to the confidentiality of medical records.</p>

<p>Charles Longjaw was being held at the Oregon State Hospital after being found insane. Oregon changed its interpretation of the law and he was released, raising questions about how states manage violent offenders with mental illness. </p>

<p>In March 2017, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum’s office ordered the review board to turn over the records, finding “clear and convincing evidence” that disclosure was warranted.</p>

<p>"Mr. Montwheeler is accused of committing serious crimes — including killing two people, and seriously injuring a third — a few short weeks after his discharge,” the order said. “Under the circumstances, there is a strong public interest in understanding and evaluating the bases for PSRB’s release decision.”</p>

<p>Instead of turning over the documents, the security review board retained $400-an-hour private attorneys to sue the Enterprise in state court, seeking a court order to keep the records secret. State agencies had used such a tactic only twice before in the prior 30 years. The review board also asked that the Enterprise be ordered to pay the state’s costs in bringing the case.</p>

<p>Unable to afford such a legal fight, the Enterprise launched a $20,000 fundraising campaign to hire lawyers to defend itself.</p>

<p>Two days later, Gov. Kate Brown intervened, directing the review board to drop its case and provide the Montwheeler documents.</p>

<p>“No one requesting public records should be at risk of being sued by a state agency,” she said. “I believe the public is best served by bringing this matter to an end now, rather than after a lengthy and costly litigation.”</p>

<p>The agency complied, and later paid $5,000 to cover the Enterprise’s legal fees.</p>

<p>Since then, the review board has routinely provided its hearing exhibits to the Enterprise and other news organizations, including the records underlying today’s story on Longjaw.</p>

<h2 id="thed3millionresearchbreakdown">The $3 Million Research Breakdown</h2>

<p>by: Jodi S. Cohen</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-25</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/university-of-illinois-chicago-mani-pavuluri-3-million-research-breakdown </p>

<p>Lincoln Agnew, special to ProPublica Illinois</p>

<p>For nearly two decades, the University of Illinois at Chicago has touted child psychiatrist Mani Pavuluri as one of its stars: She founded a renowned clinic to treat children with bipolar disorder and secured millions of dollars in coveted federal funding to help unlock the mysteries of the disease.</p>

<p>Parents from around the country brought their children to see her. She helped boost the university as a leader in the field of child psychiatry.</p>

<p>But as Pavuluri’s reputation grew, she put some of these particularly vulnerable children at serious risk in one of her clinical trials. She violated research rules by testing the powerful drug lithium on children younger than 13 although she was told not to, failed to properly alert parents of the study’s risks and falsified data to cover up the misconduct, records show.</p>

<p>In December, the university quietly paid a severe penalty for Pavuluri’s misconduct and its own lax oversight, after the National Institute of Mental Health demanded weeks earlier that the public institution — which has struggled with declining state funding — repay all $3.1 million it had received for Pavuluri’s study.</p>

<p>If you or your child participated in one of Dr. Mani Pavuluri’s studies, we’d like to hear about your experience. Please email us at uicresearch@propublica.org.</p>

<p>In issuing the rare rebuke, federal officials concluded that Pavuluri’s “serious and continuing noncompliance” with rules to protect human subjects violated the terms of the grant. NIMH said she had “increased risk to the study subjects” and made any outcomes scientifically meaningless, according to documents obtained by ProPublica Illinois.</p>

<p>Pavuluri’s research is also under investigation by two offices in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: the inspector general’s office, which examines waste, fraud and abuse in government programs, according to subpoenas obtained by ProPublica Illinois, and the Office of Research Integrity, according to university officials.</p>

<p>A ProPublica Illinois investigation, which included interviews and the review of hundreds of documents, revealed multiple layers of failure at the university. UIC didn’t properly screen and monitor Pavuluri’s research. Even after realizing she had broken rules meant to protect her subjects, it continued to promote her to the public and within the university.</p>

<p>Pavuluri’s study, which began in 2009 and was shut down in 2013, was designed to use imaging to look at how the brains of adolescents with bipolar disorder function during a manic state, and then again after eight weeks of treatment with lithium. The hope was that the results would provide new information to help identify the disease earlier, lead to treatment and potentially even reverse how the disorder affects the brain.</p>

<p>But Pavuluri, a professor of psychiatry, strayed from the approved guidelines and abandoned safety precautions written into the study protocol, according to a November letter from NIMH to UIC in which the agency said it had determined there was wrongdoing and demanded the repayment.</p>

<p>In all, 89 of the 103 subjects enrolled in the study — 86 percent — did not meet the eligibility criteria to participate, records show. Among other violations, Pavuluri:</p>

<pre><code>•   Enrolled children younger than 10 though the study was approved only for boys and girls ages 13 to 16;

•   Included children who had previously used psychotropic medication though, under the protocol, that should have made them ineligible;

•   Managed the medical care of some of the children involved in her study though she was told to keep her clinical and research roles separate;

•   Failed to give some girls pregnancy tests before they began taking lithium even though consent forms said they would be tested. The drug can lead to an increased risk of birth defects.
</code></pre>

<p>Pavuluri isn’t solely at fault, according to NIMH. The agency determined that the university’s institutional review board, known as an IRB, a faculty panel responsible for reviewing research involving human subjects, conducted an “insufficient” initial assessment of Pavuluri’s research plans. The board didn’t even have a copy of her research protocol at its initial review.</p>

<p>Officials documented other oversight shortcomings as well.</p>

<p>“These are clearly egregious problems that occurred,” said Michael Carome, a former senior official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Human Research Protections, or OHRP, who reviewed the case for ProPublica Illinois.</p>

<p>Carome said NIMH’s decision to demand UIC repay the grant funds “is very, very uncommon.”</p>

<p>“I don’t recall in my 12-13 years there that this occurred,” added Carome, now director of the health research group at Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer-advocacy organization. “I don’t think I would have forgotten an event like that.”</p>

<p>National Institute of Mental Health Letter to the University of Illinois at Chicago</p>

<p>Read the full document</p>

<p>UIC officials declined to be interviewed. But in response to written questions, they said that “internal safeguards did not fail” and that they suspended Pavuluri’s research and took other corrective steps when they realized she was not complying with protocols. They said the university “is committed to adhering to the highest standards for research integrity.”</p>

<p>They said that Pavuluri’s violations were isolated to her research work, and that a review of her psychiatry practice, where she treated children with mental health issues, concluded she provided “high quality patient care.”</p>

<p>University officials halted Pavuluri’s lithium research in 2013 and also shut down two other federally funded projects she ran, returning nearly $800,000 that hadn’t yet been spent on those two studies.</p>

<p>Yet they named her a university scholar later that year, an honor given to about half a dozen faculty each year who excel in research and teaching and show “great promise for future achievements.” The award included $30,000.</p>

<p>They allowed her to keep her prestigious position as a faculty chair and paid her a base salary of nearly $200,000 a year, plus bonuses. And over the past five years, they allowed her to treat and oversee the care of more than 1,200 children and teens.</p>

<p>The accolades didn’t stop even after UIC’s chancellor, having reviewed an internal research-integrity investigation into her grants, concluded in 2015 that her conduct reflected a “pattern of placing research priorities above patient welfare.”</p>

<p>As recently as January, just weeks after the university sent off the multimillion-dollar check, its psychiatry department boasted on its website that a survey had named Pavuluri a “top doctor.”</p>

<p>Pavuluri, 55, recently filed paperwork to retire in June. The decision came after a meeting with her supervisors to discuss the NIMH decision, records show, and after ProPublica Illinois began asking UIC about the matter.</p>

<p>In a telephone interview, Pavuluri called her mistakes oversights and said her decisions were made in the best interests of her patients. She said she received minimal guidance and training from the university throughout the research process, though she received $7.5 million in National Institutes of Health grants during her time at UIC.</p>

<p>“I thought I was doing the right thing and not harming any child,” she said. “I treated them like an angel, all of them. I was careful and tried to do my best with each individual child. I thought that I could manage that pretty reasonably and that is something that I didn’t estimate that this would have such serious consequences, quite frankly.”</p>

<p>Raised in India, Pavuluri graduated from medical school in New Zealand and began her training there, she wrote in a 2016 book profiling prominent women in academic psychiatry.</p>

<p>She started in obstetrics and gynecology, but didn’t like it. When supervisors suggested she try psychiatry, she discovered she was fascinated by the “intimacy” of trying to solve people’s problems.</p>

<p>Pavuluri decided to move to the U.S. after reading about researchers in child psychiatry here and ultimately joined the psychiatry department at the University of Illinois College of Medicine in 2000. She founded the Pediatric Mood Disorders Program, which became a nationally renowned clinic specializing in diagnosing and treating children and teenagers with bipolar disorder and other mood-related mental illnesses.</p>

<p>As her career got underway, her motto was “dream it and do it,” she wrote in the book.</p>

<p>She did both.</p>

<p>Within five years of arriving at UIC, she had tenure. She set her sights on combining psychiatry and neuroscience to understand how the brain functions in children with mood disorders, including bipolar disorder. She won national awards, was named a distinguished fellow at the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and wrote a book for families, “What Works for Bipolar Kids: Help and Hope for Parents.”</p>

<p>Pavuluri began seeking NIMH funding in 2006 for research to examine the effects of lithium on children by imaging their brains before and after they took the mood stabilizer. The drug had long been used to treat bipolar disorder in adults, but its effectiveness in children was less understood.</p>

<p>A photo of Luke Mallard around the time he was enrolled in a study at the University of Illinois at Chicago overseen by psychiatrist Mani Pavuluri.</p>

<p>Pavuluri’s early requests for funding were denied. During reviews and consultations with NIMH staff, Pavuluri was “made keenly aware of critical human subjects issues,” records show. Those issues included the “significant risk” of providing lithium to children under 13 and the importance, in this study, of not providing direct medical care to the research subjects. The roles of researcher and clinician, according to documents, were supposed to be separate so the treatment of the children wouldn’t be influenced by the needs of the study.</p>

<p>She amended the application to resolve NIMH’s concerns. UIC got the $3.1 million grant, and the five-year study — “Affective Neuroscience of Pediatric Bipolar Disorder” — began in January 2009. Activity in her research lab picked up and, soon after, she secured two more NIMH grants.</p>

<p>Around the same time the lithium study began, Cynthia Mallard was distraught. Her 10-year-old son, Luke, was defiant at school and had trouble controlling his emotions.</p>

<p>“I wanted to find someone who could fix him,” Mallard said.</p>

<p>Mallard first took her son for counseling near their home in Bourbonnais, south of Chicago. When that didn’t help, she sought referrals and decided to try to get Luke into Pavuluri’s UIC practice; she knew of Pavuluri’s reputation. But every time Mallard called for an appointment, she said, she was told Pavuluri wasn’t seeing new patients. She pleaded and was told Luke could get an appointment if he entered a clinical trial, she said.</p>

<p>Dr. Pavuluri’s Letter About Luke Mallard</p>

<p>Read the full document</p>

<p>“They told me I could get Dr. Pavuluri to see him every week if I were to get in the study,” she said.</p>

<p>Pavuluri prescribed lithium, and Mallard, a developmental therapist, immediately noticed changes in her son. He paced, walked in circles around their living room and heard voices in his head. He thought he saw other people when he looked in a mirror.</p>

<p>“When he was on lithium, he turned into a different kid,” said Mallard. “I told Dr. Pavuluri, ‘I don’t care what you have to do, get him off this stuff.’”</p>

<p>Luke took the lithium for at most two months, according to the family’s records. Then Pavuluri switched his medication. The family’s records show that he continued to see Pavuluri for therapy for several more years and enrolled in at least one other study she led; UIC officials said that study has not been called into question.</p>

<p>Luke, now 19, is six feet tall, with floppy dark hair that he brushes away when it falls into his square-rimmed glasses. He graduated from high school, has taken community college classes and currently works at a local pizza restaurant. He said that he hopes to become a therapist to help children.</p>

<p>On a recent evening, he sat at his kitchen table and described his years of therapy and medication. He enjoyed taking part in Pavuluri’s studies, he said, if only because he was paid to participate and got a day off from school to travel an hour or more each way to her clinic.</p>

<p>Luke Mallard, now 19, in the yard of his family’s home in Bourbonnais, south of Chicago. He was 10 when his mother took him to see psychiatrist Mani Pavuluri at her clinic at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She prescribed him lithium.</p>

<p>“Every time I saw her, she was very nice, very sweet,” Luke said.</p>

<p>But he said the lithium had side effects he didn’t like. He quickly went from being a skinny kid to an overweight preteen. He said he’s upset she prescribed the drug when he was so young.</p>

<p>“I have these issues now and I don’t know if they will go away,” he said. “I don’t know if lithium was a direct cause of it, but it didn’t help anything.”</p>

<p>An Adverse Event</p>

<p>Pavuluri’s research program began to unravel in 2013, the lithium study’s final year. The issue started with a patient who came to Pavuluri when her medications for manic symptoms no longer were effective. Records do not identify the patient, but Pavuluri said in the interview that she was a girl.</p>

<p>Pavuluri had the girl withdraw from those drugs and put her on other medication to ease her into the lithium study. But she began to experience “heightened irritability,” according to records, and when symptoms worsened, she was hospitalized — her first time for a manic episode.</p>

<p>Pavuluri said the drugs weren’t an issue. She said the episode was caused by conflicts at home.</p>

<p>Research guidelines require that a serious and unanticipated “adverse event” involving a human subject be reported to the IRB, and Pavuluri did so in January. The university’s IRB chair at the time, James Fischer, a pharmacy professor, determined the study “likely contributed to the increased severity” of her symptoms. According to records, he reported the incident to the NIMH and OHRP. It was the only adverse event reported during the study.</p>

<p>UIC Letter About Adverse Event</p>

<p>Read the full document</p>

<p>ProPublica Illinois obtained hundreds of documents related to Pavuluri’s studies in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. But university officials withheld or redacted many records, citing federal and state laws regarding patient privacy and the confidentiality of research.</p>

<p>Those records include some communications between the university and the federal agencies that likely would provide more detail about the extent of the research failings and how the university responded. The university also withheld Pavuluri’s research protocols.</p>

<p>The records the university released, however, show that two months after its initial report of a problem, the IRB suspended Pavuluri’s research and the university launched an audit of the protocol to determine what had gone wrong. In a letter to OHRP, Fischer commended Pavuluri for her “cooperation and forthrightness” in addressing the issue.</p>

<p>But as the IRB dug deeper into Pavuluri’s three studies, it found more problems. In subsequent letters, Fischer reported “serious non-compliance” in the study and by the IRB, and he proposed a corrective action plan. By April 2013, the university also had suspended Pavuluri’s other two active NIMH-funded studies, for a minimum of six months, while her research privileges were revoked.</p>

<p>After reviewing the other two studies, the IRB determined they also were out of compliance, according to letters sent in June 2013 from the university to OHRP. Those studies had similar problems. Patients were enrolled despite not meeting eligibility requirements, research procedures began before the dates on the permission forms, and some children were enrolled in multiple studies.</p>

<p>UIC officials decided to shut down the other two studies and return the unexpended funds, emails and other documents show.</p>

<p>For one, the university returned $356,810 that hadn’t been spent from a $3.2 million grant. For the other, in its early stages, the university returned $431,256, university officials said.</p>

<p>In June 2014, the Mallard family and about 350 others — including healthy control subjects — received a letter from the university saying it had found “problems” with the conduct in Pavuluri’s three studies. It said children may have been put at greater risk than what had been explained in consent and parental permission forms.</p>

<p>Cynthia Mallard and her son Luke discuss documents from his UIC case file.</p>

<p>Cynthia Mallard, dealing with a particularly tough time in Luke’s life, filed the letter with other paperwork on his illness.</p>

<p>Another family wrote back.</p>

<p>“We have been struggling with this letter since we received it and have been deeply disturbed, specifically regarding the parental consent and the quality of care,” according to their reply, obtained by ProPublica Illinois, though the authors’ names were redacted for privacy. “Have you turned this over to your malpractice carrier? If not, we would request that you do so at this time so that we can see what course of action to take from here.”</p>

<p>A longer follow-up letter to the university’s claims office was entirely redacted except for the last sentence: “I hope that we can settle this amicably and in the interest of all parties.”</p>

<p>UIC said no claim was ever filed.</p>

<p>A Failure of Oversight</p>

<p>UIC is a federal research powerhouse with one of the largest medical schools in the country. Over the past five years, the university has received a total of more than $950 million in federal research funding, placing it among the top 60 research universities during that period.</p>

<p>The institution had faced trouble for lax research oversight before. In 1999, federal regulators temporarily shut down all research involving humans after finding deficiencies in the scientific and ethical review process.</p>

<p>The university’s role in supervising Pavuluri’s research suggests similar shortcomings. Not only was there insufficient initial review by the IRB, NIMH found, but the panel then fast-tracked approval without any justification for doing so.</p>

<p>And then, just four months after the study began, the IRB also approved lowering the minimum age of participants in the study to 10 — even though NIMH had specifically prohibited that — and did so without requesting Pavuluri’s rationale for the change. The IRB approved an amendment allowing participants to have previously taken other medications as long as lithium was not among them.</p>

<p>NIMH said it was never informed of these IRB-approved changes.</p>

<p>“The changes were significant, because they increased risk to study subjects,” according to the November letter in which NIMH demanded repayment from the university. Five subjects younger than 10 enrolled in the study; Pavuluri said only a few that young were enrolled, and they got in “by mistake.”</p>

<p>The IRB also failed to catch omissions in the consent forms, including informing subjects and their parents that lithium is not FDA-approved for children under 12 and there are alternative courses of treatment for bipolar disorder.</p>

<p>Lithium is not FDA-approved for that age group because there have not been enough studies of its use. The drug continues to be tested in clinical trials; some psychiatrists say it is one of the best available treatments.</p>

<p>As Pavuluri’s study progressed, there were other oversight failures. NIH policy recommends that individuals on a study’s data and safety monitoring board, which is tasked with observing a trial’s progress and the safety of its participants, “are in no way associated with the trial.” But the board for Pavuluri’s study included Pavuluri and a co-investigator, while a report by the monitoring board, submitted partway through the study, was prepared by a member of Pavuluri’s research staff, records show.</p>

<p>UIC officials said Pavuluri’s co-investigator was originally an independent member before joining the research team and that there were other independent members on the panel.</p>

<p>Nicholas Steneck, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Michigan who was a consultant to the U.S. Office of Research Integrity, said it is difficult to understand how such a large research institution could have such a “poorly functioning IRB.” He called the UIC board’s failures “IRB 101 mistakes.”</p>

<p>“In this case, it is the institution that failed,” he said after reviewing the case for ProPublica Illinois. “It could be a case of an overstressed system simply losing a sense of what they were responsible for and where they needed to draw lines.”</p>

<p>In fact, UIC’s research oversight problems were not limited to Pavuluri’s studies.</p>

<p>In 2014, prompted at least in part by the problems with Pavuluri’s research, the NIH and the OHRP conducted an on-site evaluation of UIC’s system for protecting human research subjects. Federal officials determined that, in approving other research projects, university IRBs “sometimes lacked sufficient information to make the determinations required for approval of research,” according to a December 2014 letter from OHRP to UIC. The letter cited a study — not a Pavuluri project — that the IRB approved before it had enough information and other studies for which research approval was expedited when it shouldn’t have been.</p>

<p>UIC officials said in a statement that they have tightened oversight. IRBs, they said, now complete more detailed reviews of protocols before approving changes, and they conduct more random audits of clinical trials to determine if researchers are following protocols.</p>

<p>Still, in the case of Pavuluri’s studies, the officials put the blame on her.</p>

<p>“The principal investigator is responsible for the ethical and professional conduct of sponsored research projects in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including for timely and accurately informing the IRB of all changes in scope,” UIC officials said in their emailed responses to questions.</p>

<p>But Amneh Kiswani, who served as an assistant director in the campus’ Office of Research Services, said the university bears at least some of the responsibility. When Pavuluri sought an amendment to expand the age of participants, for example, the IRB should have made sure that NIMH had already approved of that change, Kiswani said.</p>

<p>“There are supposed to be controls and policies and procedures in place so these types of occurrences don’t happen,” said Kiswani, who left UIC in 2014. “In this particular situation, both are responsible: the institution for failing to follow the rules for changes in scope and the investigator for not knowing her responsibility as a principal investigator.”</p>

<p>Carl Elliott, a professor of bioethics at the University of Minnesota, agreed that the NIMH’s determination of wrongdoing “sounds at least as critical of the IRB as it does” of Pavuluri.</p>

<p>And he noted that the problems began even before her research got underway.</p>

<p>“It baffles me how an IRB could give its ethics approval without reading the protocol,” said Elliott, who also reviewed the case at ProPublica Illinois’ request. “If it doesn’t have the protocol, they can’t really know what it is they are approving. It doesn’t make any sense at all.”</p>

<p>Pavuluri said she is shouldering more than her share of the blame when the university was also at fault.</p>

<p>“It was in their interest to kind of maybe see this as one person’s mistake [rather] than the responsibility of the IRB as well,” she said.</p>

<p>Stinging Criticism</p>

<p>Pavuluri, in an interview, said she expanded the criteria for who could be included in the study because it was difficult to find enough subjects within the narrow age range. She said it also was difficult to find children with bipolar disorder who weren’t already taking other medication.</p>

<p>She said she also believed a wider pool of subjects would strengthen her findings.</p>

<p>“I thought it would be a better scientific outcome if I have power in the study in the higher numbers,” she said.</p>

<p>While her transgressions remained unknown to the general public, she appeared to address them in a chapter of the book, “Women in Academic Psychiatry,” which features 16 leading women psychiatrists discussing their careers. She described her large laboratory as a “three-ring circus” where she oversaw a flurry of grant submissions and a staff of faculty and students.</p>

<p>Asked to name her obstacles, she wrote: “I could not attend to some IRB amendments that were due or problem-solve the nuances in the large laboratory. No matter how angelic I was with my research subjects, or how hard I worked day and night, things crashed. Here, I learned my main lesson, which is the need to have a tight grip on research supervision. No work is done till the paperwork is done.”</p>

<p>A university panel tasked with investigating the integrity of Pavuluri’s research was less forgiving. UIC refused to provide the panel’s report to ProPublica Illinois or even say who took part in the review.</p>

<p>University officials declined to answer questions about girls not being given pregnancy tests and other shortcomings with laboratory tests, citing the pending federal investigation. Pavuluri said some of the younger children did not get pregnancy tests because she didn’t think they were sexually active.</p>

<p>But after reviewing the panel’s report, UIC chancellor Michael Amiridis wrote in a July 2015 letter that the violations of protocol “collectively represent serious deviations that violate accepted ethical guidelines and professional standards in clinical practice.”</p>

<p>UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis’ Letter</p>

<p>Read the full document</p>

<p>He said that Pavuluri’s behavior “repeatedly put subjects at risk and damaged the credibility of the research data.”</p>

<p>He cited her “reckless disregard” in deciding who to enroll in the study, the lack of pregnancy and laboratory testing, and “falsification and fabrication of research data in an attempt to obfuscate evidence of noncompliance with the research protocols.”</p>

<p>He ordered a review of her clinical practice, barred her indefinitely from conducting research and directed her to retract several scientific journal articles based on the three studies.</p>

<p>Three of Pavuluri’s journal articles were retracted after she told the editors that UIC had concluded she had “intentionally and knowingly” made false statements about the participants’ medication histories and that the falsehoods “seriously compromised” the results and conclusions. The retractions were covered in about a half-dozen posts on the Retraction Watch website, which monitors scientific misconduct.</p>

<p>UIC officials said the review of Pavuluri’s clinical practice did not uncover any problems and there was no reason to report her to the state’s medical licensing board.</p>

<p>But UIC informed federal authorities it had reason to think additional children had been harmed in her studies. Reports from parents and other evidence led the investigative panel to conclude that “claims by [Pavuluri] that no subjects were harmed in her studies were false,” according to an email from OHRP to UIC.</p>

<p>That conclusion was based on issues raised by parents who contacted UIC in the months after the university informed them of the problems with Pavuluri’s research, according to a response to an open-records request.</p>

<p>The Fallout</p>

<p>It’s difficult to know how unusual the federal government’s demand for reimbursement is; NIH said it does not track such actions. The agency would not provide a comparable example.</p>

<p>An NIH spokeswoman said the agency does not discuss its decisions about specific grants but that it “takes seriously non-compliance with the terms and condition of award.”</p>

<p>UIC refunded the controversial grant with money from a fund that is supposed to support such areas as research, administration, student scholarships and building operations. Campus officials said they knew of no other time when UIC had to reimburse grant funds for failing to comply with guidelines on research integrity or the use of human subjects.</p>

<p>Officials acknowledged the $3 million payout will impact other spending, but said they do not yet know what they won’t fund as a result. UIC’s operating budget is more than $2.3 billion this fiscal year.</p>

<p>The financial hit comes at a troubling time for the institution, which has seen state funding decline about 10 percent this year following a nearly two-year budget stalemate that left universities across the state scrambling to make ends meet. The University of Illinois system recently requested $585 million in state funding for capital projects that would address “only the most urgent priorities.”</p>

<p>Pavuluri, meanwhile, is ending her UIC career. She was called into a meeting in February with Anand Kumar, head of UIC’s psychiatry department, and Todd Van Neck, an associate dean in the College of Medicine. They wanted to discuss NIMH’s ruling and its demand that the money be returned, emails show.</p>

<p>That evening, Pavuluri sent an email thanking them for giving her “options for the next step.” Most of the email is redacted, but it concludes: “I will cherish, co-operate and be grateful as the loyal UIC employee as I seek the opportunity to keep serving.”</p>

<p>Kumar responded several days later. He said he shared her questions with the leadership team and came to the conclusion that “under all of the circumstances” it did “not seem realistic” for her to stay at UIC in a different role — specifically, an untenured position that would have allowed her to still treat patients.</p>

<p>Later in February, Pavuluri submitted retirement paperwork indicating her last day will be June 30. She will collect a pension and will receive a $35,512 vacation payout, records show.</p>

<p>In spite of the controversy, Pavuluri has passionate defenders. One woman, whose 21-year-old daughter has been treated by Pavuluri since she was 11, called Pavuluri a “lifesaver.” She said her daughter had been hospitalized four times before seeking treatment from Pavuluri, but hasn’t been hospitalized since. She participated in a research trial that did not involve lithium.</p>

<p>“It breaks my heart to think someone would speak poorly of her or cast judgement on her,” said the mother, who did not want to be identified to protect her daughter’s privacy. “I know people have to be held to what they are supposed to do, but never would she put a child in harm’s way for the sake of research. Never, ever.”</p>

<p>Another parent, Rebecca Sikorski, didn’t know about any of these concerns when she took her 12-year-old daughter to see Pavuluri toward the end of last summer. She was impressed that the clinic was promoted as being involved in “cutting edge” research.</p>

<p>“If their main practitioner of bipolar disorder is being investigated, I would have wanted to know that,” she said.</p>

<p>At her daughter’s last appointment in February, Pavuluri told them she was retiring from UIC and hoped to open her own practice in the Gold Coast neighborhood.</p>

<p>When asked why she is retiring, Pavuluri said in the interview that UIC officials are upset about repaying the grant money. She said the years of investigation have been “traumatic.”</p>

<p>“I feel it is best if I give up my wonderful ability to really do the best I could. I tried really hard,” she said, choking back tears.</p>

<p>She said it was difficult to talk about the issue.</p>

<p>“It is giving me PTSD.”</p>

<h2 id="propublicas2018readersurveyresults">ProPublica’s 2018 Reader Survey Results</h2>

<p>by: Jill Shepherd</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-26</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/propublica-2018-reader-survey-results </p>

<p>The results are in for this year’s reader survey. Many thanks to the over 3,000 people who responded.</p>

<p>Looking at this year’s results, the gender of our readers has evened out a bit. Last year, we reported 58 percent of our readers were female, which reversed a yearslong trend of majority male. This year, we are closer to an even split, with 48 percent of you being male, and 51 percent female.</p>

<p>How you get your news has continued on its upward trend towards digital: 77 percent of you get your national news online in some way (either directly, or through an RSS feed or mobile apps), two points more than last year. Print newspapers held steady from last year to this at six percent, while radio dropped two points to six percent and TV increased one point to 11 percent.</p>

<p>You continue to be a very educated group of readers. Eighty-three percent of you report having a college degree, with 49 percent having a postgraduate degree. Thirty-nine percent of you report a yearly household income of over $100,000, and 37 percent report $50,000 to $100,000.</p>

<p>The ages comprising our audience has fluctuated over the last few surveys. Three years ago, 65 percent of our audience was 55 years of age or older. Last year, it was 49 percent, and this year, it’s up again at 55 percent.</p>

<p>Eighty-two percent of you report being non-Hispanic white (down from 84 percent last year), three percent report being black or African American (up one point from last year), four percent Latino or Hispanic, two percent East Asian or Asian American. Around one percent or less of you report being South Asian or Indian American, Middle Eastern or Arab American, Native American or Alaskan native, or Hawaiian or Pacific Islander. And nine percent of you preferred not to answer the question (these numbers equal a bit more than 100 percent because we allowed folks to choose more than one box if they needed to).</p>

<p>This year, we modified the options when asking you about your own political leanings by adding in the qualifiers, “very” and “moderately.” Six percent of you report being conservative, five points of that being “moderately conservative.” On the other side, 84 percent report being liberal, with 47 percent at “moderately liberal,” and the other 35 percent as “very liberal.” Ten percent reported being non-ideological, and another 11 percent reported “other.” For comparison, Gallup reports that 35 percent of U.S. adults identify as conservative, 26 percent as liberal, and 35 percent as moderate. In last year’s ProPublica survey, 74 percent of you identified as simply “liberal,” one percent of you as “conservative,” and 19 percent as moderate.</p>

<p>As for how you view ProPublica’s political leaning, 33 percent of you consider our reporting to be liberal, just under 27 percent think we’re moderate, 40 percent consider us non-ideological (as we intend our reporting to be), and under one percent consider our reporting to be conservative in nature.</p>

<p>One of the new questions this year helped us learn what our audience knows about us. While we’re known for our deeply researched investigative reporting, our nonprofit mission is to use that reporting to spur change, for example, the passage of a new law. We wondered how many of our readers knew that, and it turns out many of you do — 89 percent of you to be exact, and 77 percent of you could recall an update to one of our investigations (for a full list of the kinds of impact that our reporting has spurred, head over to the Impact section of our website).</p>

<p>When asked which area of our work you personally find the most valuable, “exposing wrongdoing,” was at the top of that list, with 77 percent of respondents choosing it. Following that with 71 percent was “long-in depth coverage of an issue,” 67 percent of you chose “making data available to the public,” and then “spurring change,” was chosen by 50 percent.</p>

<p>We greatly appreciate everyone who took time to provide us with this feedback. While unscientific, these results are extremely useful as we try to understand who you are, what you value about ProPublica, and how we can better serve you.</p>

<h2 id="howwefoundsourcesforourresearchmisconductstoryandhowyoucanhelpusfindmore">How We Found Sources for Our Research Misconduct Story — And How You Can Help Us Find More</h2>

<p>by: Jodi S. Cohen</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-26</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/university-of-illinois-chicago-mani-pavuluri-research-misconduct-sources </p>

<p>Luke Mallard was mentioned in a 2011 report by ABC 7 Chicago about Dr. Mani Pavuluri’s work imaging children’s brains to try to determine if they had bipolar disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</p>

<p>This story was first published in ProPublica Illinois’ weekly newsletter. Sign up for that here.</p>

<p>A story we published yesterday revealed how the University of Illinois at Chicago recently had to repay the federal government $3.1 million after the National Institute of Mental Health determined one of the school’s star faculty members violated grant protocols — and put vulnerable kids at risk.</p>

<p>UIC child psychiatrist Mani Pavuluri had received the grant funds from NIMH to study how the powerful drug lithium affects the brain functions of adolescents with bipolar disorder. But she violated several guidelines, including enrolling children younger than 10 in the trial though it was supposed to only include 13- to 16-year-olds.</p>

<p>UIC was at fault, too. It failed to properly oversee her work, according to NIMH.</p>

<p>We’d like to hear about your experience. Please email us: uicresearch@propublica.org</p>

<p>We believed it was important to talk with Pavuluri’s patients and their parents to find out what they knew.</p>

<p>But identifying families was — and still is — challenging. Patient names are private under state and federal laws, and any information the university thought could possibly identify them was redacted from documents we requested under the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>Without names, we were essentially starting with nothing.</p>

<p>Still, we ultimately tracked down and talked with families of three of Pavuluri’s patients.</p>

<p>How did we do it? You might be surprised to learn an Amazon book review was one clue we used. Here’s how it all came together:</p>

<p>We found the first family when engagement reporter Logan Jaffe spotted a 2011 report by ABC 7 Chicago about one of Pavuluri’s other studies — not the lithium one. The report discussed Pavuluri’s work imaging children’s brains to try to determine if they had bipolar disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and included a call-out to find more research subjects. It included testimony from two patients who were already enrolled, one of whom was Luke Mallard.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be neat to see how his brain changes over the next four years,” his mother, Cynthia, said in the report.</p>

<p>This 2011 report by ABC 7 Chicago included testimony from two patients who were enrolled in one of Dr. Mani Pavuluri's studies, one of whom was Luke Mallard.</p>

<p>So I called Luke’s mother, expecting to hear about the family’s positive experience. Instead, she sheepishly told me that she had enrolled Luke in the clinical trial because it was the only way she could get an appointment to see Pavuluri. Then, before I even asked about the lithium study, she shared her regrets that she had consented to Luke taking the drug when he was just 10.</p>

<p>“That was the first product she put him on,” she recalled recently. “When he was on the lithium, he turned into a different kid … I told Dr. Pavuluri, ‘I don’t care what you have to do, get him off this stuff.’”</p>

<p>I found the second family with Amazon’s help.</p>

<p>I knew Pavuluri had written a book about bipolar disorder, so I went to Amazon to see if anyone had written a review and included information that would help me track them down. I lucked out: A mother gave the book — “What Works for Bipolar Kids: Help and Hope for Parents” — a five-star review.</p>

<p>When I called her, she raved about Pavuluri — a perspective that was important to include in the story. Pavuluri has treated hundreds of children and has overseen the care of thousands more as a professor at the University of Illinois College of Medicine and founder of the institution’s Pediatric Mood Disorders Program.</p>

<p>“She was a lifesaver and she is still and there is nobody like her that we found anywhere,” the mother, who did not want to be identified to protect her daughter’s privacy, told me when I called.</p>

<p>Facebook helped me find the third family.</p>

<p>Dr. Mani Pavuluri’s book, “What Works for Bipolar Kids: Help and Hope for Parents,” as shown on Amazon.</p>

<p>I’m a member of several Facebook parenting groups and I decided to search them to see if anyone mentioned Pavuluri’s name.</p>

<p>The search turned up a post from a mother who recently asked for recommendations for a doctor for her child with mental health issues.</p>

<p>Rebecca Sikorski responded and recommended Pavuluri.</p>

<p>I sent Sikorski a Facebook message, asking if we could talk. She wrote back that she could no longer recommend Pavuluri. When we spoke on the phone, she explained why.</p>

<p>I told her about the research problems, and she said she wished she had known about them before taking her daughter to see Pavuluri.</p>

<p>In the end, I ended up finding three parents through very different methods. Each of their perspectives are important to the story. None of them were upset we had reached out.But those are just three people among hundreds who may be directly affected by Pavuluri’s misconduct. We could use your help spreading the word about this story, with the hopes of it better reaching those individuals.</p>

<p>Are you part of any parenting group — on social media or otherwise?</p>

<p>Are you in the field of medical research?</p>

<p>Are you a teenager who knows someone who may be suffering from bipolar disorder, or may be yourself?</p>

<p>Are you someone who just wants to help?</p>

<p>Here’s how:</p>

<p>1.) Copy and paste this text into your social and/or professional networks: Dr. Mani Pavuluri, a child psychiatrist formerly at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was found to have committed misconduct in her research studies on the effect of lithium on adolescents with bipolar disorder. If you or someone you know is a current or former Pavuluri patient, @ProPublica Illinois wants to hear from you. Email UICresearch@propublica.org. Full story: propub.li/2KhgXT1</p>

<h2 id="chicagosgangdatabaseisntjustaboutgangs">Chicago’s Gang Database Isn’t Just About Gangs</h2>

<p>by: Mick Dumke</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-19</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/chicago-gang-database-is-not-just-about-gangs </p>

<p>Jonathan Gibby/Getty Images </p>

<p>This story was first published in ProPublica Illinois’ weekly newsletter. Sign up for that here.</p>

<p>What is a gang, anyway?</p>

<p>That’s one of many questions raised by the huge amounts of data collected and maintained by the Chicago Police Department.</p>

<p>As I wrote in a column this week, nearly 129,000 people are identified as gang members in what’s commonly known as the department’s “gang database.” The gang data is marred by inconsistencies and mistakes — 13 people in it are listed as 118 years old, for instance, and two others are supposedly 132. The errors can lead to lives being upended by incarceration and deportation.</p>

<p>“It’s really affecting people in a lot of different ways, and in ways we don’t even know because we don’t know how this information is shared,” said Vanessa del Valle, a clinical assistant law professor at Northwestern University law school’s MacArthur Justice Center.</p>

<p>Chicago’s Gang Database Is Full of Errors — And Records We Have Prove It</p>

<p>Consider this: Two of the people in the police database are listed as members of the Black Panthers — the black power organization founded in the 1960s.</p>

<p>According to the police records I acquired, one of the Panthers in the database is now 64 years old and was arrested in 1987. The other, 38, was arrested in 2003. The records don’t show why either was picked up.</p>

<p>But the fact they were labeled as Panthers in the database is potentially problematic.</p>

<p>The Panthers were controversial from the beginning, and for five decades, some law enforcement officials have viewed them as a gang or band of insurrectionists rather than a political organization. During the 1960s and ’70s, the FBI led a well-documented and ugly campaign to undermine the group.</p>

<p>As recently as 2015, the Police Department opened an investigation to monitor current members of the Black Panther Party after they participated in Black Lives Matter protests.</p>

<p>This is just one example why many civil rights advocates are wary of the gang database.</p>

<p>“For me, it is important to come back to this broader question about surveillance and data,” said Andy Clarno, the coordinator of a research group at the University of Illinois-Chicago that issued a February report on the gang database.</p>

<p>“When there’s a justification granted to the practice to look at one group of people, it legitimizes the practice so it can be used much more broadly.”</p>

<p>After I started asking police about the database this week, they said they were working on changes that would let people correct information about themselves and be removed from the list.</p>

<p>I hope you will read this week’s column, my latest look at politics and policy in Illinois. And if you have any thoughts or tips about the gang database or other issues in your community, please drop me a line at mick.dumke@propublica.org.</p>

<h2 id="jacksonvillesheriffusesmisleadingdatatodefendpedestrianticketing">Jacksonville Sheriff Uses Misleading Data to Defend Pedestrian Ticketing</h2>

<p>by: Benjamin Conarck</p>

<p>date: 2018-04-19</p>

<p>url: https://www.propublica.org/article/jacksonville-sheriff-uses-misleading-data-to-defend-pedestrian-ticketing </p>

<p>Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams in recent months has repeatedly defended his department’s enforcement of pedestrian violations. Claims of a racial disparity have been overstated, he has argued. There is no policy targeting people of color, he has insisted. He’s made his case before the City Council. Most recently, Williams had a report supporting his claims hand-delivered to a local NAACP official.</p>

<p>When making his case, Williams has relied on what he has said is a true accounting of pedestrian ticket data for recent years. That data, he claims, shows that 45 percent of tickets went to blacks. That figure, while greater than the city’s black population, is substantially less than the number reported by the Times-Union and ProPublica in a series of articles late last year. The Times-Union and ProPublica reported that 55 percent of the tickets over the prior five years had been issued to blacks.</p>

<p>This week ProPublica and the Times-Union obtained the sheriff’s data, and the numbers are misleading.</p>

<p>Williams, it turns out, has included in his count tickets written for “soliciting,” which typically means panhandling. It is a criminal charge for which people are routinely arrested. It is not covered by one of the more than two dozen civil statutes under which people are ticketed for pedestrian violations — jaywalking, for instance, or walking on the wrong side of the road.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the roughly 800 soliciting charges were issued to whites, often people seeking money or food at the entrances to freeways and other locations. It is unclear why so many went to white people, but the sheriff’s decision to include them in his presentations on pedestrian ticketing accounts for his claim that only 45 percent of all pedestrian tickets in recent years were issued to blacks.</p>

<p>Ken Stokes, chairman of the Jacksonville NAACP’s Legal Redress committee, was hand-delivered the sheriff’s data recently. Stokes said he was told the numbers represented the totality of pedestrian enforcement. The inclusion of the soliciting tickets in the data was not explained to him, Stokes said.</p>

<p>“The main issue is trust,” said Stokes, who called for a halt to the pedestrian ticket writing in the wake of the reporting by the Times-Union and ProPublica. “The black community doesn’t trust the police department. And when you keep this kind of stuff circulating, that hurts your credibility.”</p>

<p>Walking While Black</p>

<p>The Times-Union and ProPublica asked the sheriff’s office about the data he was using in his public presentations. In response, the office issued a three-paragraph statement defending the count and its enforcement actions.</p>

<p>“All of these laws are in place to protect pedestrians,” the statement said. “We do not selectively exclude certain ones from our analysis.”</p>

<p>Last year, the Times-Union and ProPublica documented the often serious implications for people receiving the $65 pedestrian tickets. Credit ratings were damaged when people could not pay. In hundreds of cases, people lost their driver’s licenses when they were unable or unwilling to pay.</p>

<p>And in hundreds more instances, people were given tickets that didn’t comply with state law. Black pedestrians were over-represented in virtually every category of ticket.</p>

<p>Williams and his office have maintained that the tickets are given merely as a public safety matter in a city with notoriously high rates of pedestrian deaths. Yet reporting by the Times-Union and ProPublica showed that there was no strong correlation between where people were being killed and where tickets were being issued. Indeed, whites made up the majority of people killed by vehicles in Jacksonville.</p>

<p>The sheriff’s use of the soliciting violations in his defense of pedestrian ticket enforcement is odd in that his office does not otherwise lump the criminal citations with the pedestrian violations. The office’s pedestrian education brochure, for instance, says the most common infraction committed by citizens was crossing outside the crosswalk. Had the office actually counted soliciting as a pedestrian infraction, it would have easily been the top category.</p>

<p>Those arrested and jailed for soliciting can face fines of $300 or more, as well as the loss of their driver’s license.</p>

<p>The Interfaith Coalition for Action, Reconciliation &amp; Empowerment — a nonprofit representing 38 congregations and 30,000 residents — recently met with the sheriff and discussed pedestrian enforcement. The group intends to ask Williams to stop writing bicycle and pedestrian tickets with fines and instead issue verbal or written warnings. Stokes of the NAACP, other civil rights activists, the city’s public defender, and several city council members, have also called for such a halt to the ticketing.</p>

<p>Pastor Phillip Baber of ICARE said the sheriff needs to reconsider the discretion he’s given his officers on pedestrian tickets because the current practice has led to an imbalance in ticketing.</p>

<p>“How can you continue to support allowing them to have the discretion to be able to give tickets, especially when you have data that shows the enforcement of that and the discretion being applied has clearly discriminatory results?” Baber said. “The answer is you can’t, and that’s why we are asking for there to be an end to citations and fines for those violations.”</p>

<p>The NAACP Legal Defense Fund recently sent representatives to Jacksonville to explore the question of possible discrimination in the sheriff’s office’s pedestrian enforcement. The Legal Defense Fund has not seen Williams’ data.</p>

<p>Leslie Scott Jean Bart, an attorney who has been outspoken on the issue of pedestrian ticketing, said that whatever point the sheriff had sought to make, he would have been better served by being explicit about how he had compiled his data.</p>

<p>”Instead they just gave the numbers without any explanation for why they were different,” she said.</p>

<p>Williams could well face some tough questions on pedestrian enforcement on Monday at the annual ICARE Nehemiah Assembly in Jacksonville, in which he is scheduled to participate.</p>

<p>Baber, the pastor, said the data clearly shows concrete racial discrepancies that must be addressed.</p>

<p>“We’re kind of flummoxed by the sheriff’s response to this,” he said. “We are hopeful his response at the Nehemiah Assembly will translate to a desire to want to listen to black folks in this city when they are coming together to tell him, ‘We feel victimized.’”</p>

<p>ProPublica is doing a whole lot of hiring. We’ve listed about two dozen positions. That includes plenty of reporters — to focus on technology and big business, among other things — and a variety of different jobs.</p>

<p>We’re sharing the details far and wide. And part of that is sharing them with you. All of the jobs are listed below.</p>

<p>We know some people may look at the jobs and wonder whether they have the right credentials or background. But the truth is, we don’t care where you went to school or what your connections are. What we’re looking for are people who’ve demonstrated the ability to do great journalism or shown the potential to do so. That can come from people with all kinds of experience — not just people who see themselves as Investigative Reporters (Capital I, Capital R).</p>

<p>Everyone in our newsroom is a journalist and is given the opportunity to do stories, whether they’re a reporter, researcher, statistician, coder, designer or engagement reporter. Some of the folks doing great work here have even come from outside of journalism.</p>

<p>Hiring people with a diverse set of experiences and backgrounds has been a key part of our success. It makes our work better. Here are more details about what we’re doing to increase the diversity of our newsroom and the breakdown of our current staff. Among other things, we’ve committed to following what’s known as the Rooney Rule, meaning we will interview at least one person of color for every posted job.</p>

<p>So, if it’s not a specific educational or professional background we’re looking for, what are we looking for? Obviously, some of the specifics depend on the position. (Check out those descriptions!) But there are traits we value across the board:</p>

<pre><code>•   Be curious. Lots of complex work starts with simple questions. Tell us what piqued your interest in something and show us how that turned into something great — a story, a study, a tool, or whatever you created.

•   Be a troublemaker. You should have a passion for getting at the truth. Show us work that pried something open — whether it’s a scoop, a novel approach to solving a problem, or a creative way of reaching an audience.

•   Be self-motivated. One of ProPublica’s great strengths is the freedom we give ourselves to dig deep. It is also one of our greatest challenges. We don’t have daily deadlines to give us structure. We have to provide that ourselves. Show us how you’ve gone above and beyond, worked hard and pushed yourself forward.

•   Be collegial. We do our best work together. Show us how you’ve collaborated on projects that resulted in something great.

<p>These seem familiar? Well, here are all of our jobs.</p>

<h2 id="chicagosgangdatabaseisfulloferrorsandrecordswehaveproveit">Chicago’s Gang Database Is Full of Errors — And Records We Have Prove It</h2>

<p>by: Mick Dumke</p>

<p>Gang graffiti painted on a stop sign on the 5800 block of South Sacramento Avenue in Chicago.</p>

<p>ProPublica Illinois reporter Mick Dumke looks at the state’s political issues and personalities in this occasional column.</p>

<p>During January 1984, the Chicago Police Department labeled more than 700 people as suspected gang members following arrests for various crimes.</p>

<p>One was in his early 30s and identified as a member of the Black P Stones.</p>

<p>By last fall, nearly 34 years later, that individual was 77 — and still in what police commonly refer to as the department’s “gang database.”</p>

<p>In fact, the 77-year-old was one of 163 people in their 70s or 80s in the database, which now includes information about 128,000 people and counting, according to records I obtained through a series of requests under the state Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<p>It’s hard to fathom that there are so many elderly, active gang members in Chicago who need to be tracked by police. But those aren’t the only curious entries in the database. As of this March, it also included 13 people who are supposedly 118 years old — and two others listed as 132.</p>

<p>Over the last year, all kinds of questions have been raised about the way the police department collects and uses its gang data). But it’s become clear to me the database is riddled with dubious entries, discrepancies and outright errors.</p>

<p>These are serious problems, because Chicago police and other law enforcement officials regularly cite the database during criminal investigations, immigration enforcement and court proceedings. Information from the database could also surface in background checks for jobs. And getting your name removed is all but impossible.</p>

<p>Yet the department has long fought against releasing portions of the database, or explaining how it’s generated or used.</p>

<p>Last year, two men brought separate lawsuits against the department—and, in one of the cases, against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well—after federal officials detained and moved to deport them. They were targeted because the database identified them as gang members.</p>

<p>Both men said the information was false: Police had added them to the database based on their race and the neighborhoods where they lived, they said, and gave them no opportunity to remove their names. One case was settled in December, with police conceding they had made a mistake. The other case is still in federal court.</p>

<p>Here’s one example of how confusing the issue is: There technically isn’t a stand-alone list or database of suspected gang members, though police often refer to it that way. The department tracks gang affiliation along with arrest records, reported crimes and other information in a massive data “warehouse” called the Citizen and Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting (CLEAR) system.</p>

<p>Officers enter information about everyone who is arrested, as well as many people who are stopped but not charged with a crime.</p>

<p>The department’s internal rules for classifying someone as a gang member are fuzzy. If suspects admit they are in a gang or have gang tattoos, that counts. In some instances, police base the decision on what they hear from sources deemed to have given them “reliable information” in the past.</p>

<p>In addition to Chicago police, other police departments, plus state and federal law enforcement agencies, have access to the data.</p>

<p>CPD Gang Database</p>

<p>Download the raw gang data provided by the Chicago Police Department in November 2017 and March 2018 from its CLEAR data warehouse.</p>

<p>Even some cops who use the database have concerns about its fairness and accuracy. One officer told me he wonders if it’s constitutional. Another said he double-checks information in the database by looking up police reports, because he’s aware that some people are identified as gang members based solely on where they live.</p>

<p>“I know to be skeptical,” he said.</p>

<p>But that officer also uses the data to get a sense of people he encounters — who they’ve associated with, where they’ve been. Police need the tool for their efforts to reduce violence, he argued: “Don’t try to get rid of our database.”</p>

<p>The records I obtained from the department don’t inspire much confidence.</p>

<p>In November, after three months of denials and delays, the department gave me a file from its data warehouse with 128,137 entries. In March, I received updated information.</p>

<p>Because of privacy concerns, the two files do not include names or any records of juveniles. But they offer some revealing glimpses of the department’s gang data.</p>

<p>Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan Builds Power From the Ground Up — And Sometimes From the Basement</p>

<p>For starters, nearly everyone in the database is a person of color: 70 percent are African-American and 25 percent are Hispanic. Most are in their 20s and 30s.</p>

<p>The gangs listed range from well-known street organizations such as the Gangster Disciples to obscure or mostly defunct groups with only one or two alleged members in the database, such as the Thorndale Jagoffs.</p>

<p>The records also show that the gang database is expanding. Over the last three years, police added thousands of people they had never arrested, according to the data.</p>

<p>Still, the files are riddled with errors and illogical information that police officials couldn’t explain to me.</p>

<p>In response to questions, the department said it will revamp how it gathers, maintains and uses gang-related information.</p>

<p>“Criminal justice and arrest data are important tools for CPD to help make communities safer,” department spokesman Anthony Guglielmi wrote in an email. “That’s why ensuring the information is accurate and reliable is crucial.”</p>

<p>He said the department is drafting a plan to include vetting who goes into the database, limiting which agencies can access it, and giving people a way to “challenge and appeal gang affiliation status.” A public comment period will be scheduled.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the city’s official watchdog, Inspector General Joe Ferguson, has announced a review of the gang database and has held community meetings to gather input.</p>

<p>At a meeting last week, Terry Williams, a longtime West Side resident, said he was pulled over by police a few weeks ago and asked if he was still in a gang. The information, he said, dated to a drug conviction more than two decades ago.</p>

<p>“Don’t keep people hostage because of [their] past,” he said. “It’s like you never get to come home from the war.”</p>
