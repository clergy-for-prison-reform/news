<h2 id="privatetallahatchieprisontohouse1350federaldetainees">Private Tallahatchie prison to house 1,350 federal detainees</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Michelle Liu</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-26</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/27/private-tallahatchie-prison-to-house-1350-federal-detainees/ </p>

<p>A privately-owned prison in Tallahatchie County will soon house up to 1,350 prisoners on behalf of the U.S. Marshals Service.</p>

<p>Nashville-based CoreCivic announced earlier this month that it had entered a new, two-year contract with the U.S. Marshals Service beginning June 14 to place detainees in the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility located in Tutwiler.</p>

<p>“The U.S. Marshals Service has experienced an increasing need for detention capacity as its average daily prisoner population has increased throughout the past year,” said Damon Hininger, president and CEO of CoreCivic, in a statement.</p>

<p>“Our Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility has the available capacity to accept detainee populations quickly due to our existing staff of experienced, well-trained corrections professionals. We are pleased to provide the Marshals with immediate capacity to assist the agency as it carries out its critical public safety mission.”</p>

<p>CoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America, has owned the facility since 2000. The company is one of the country’s two largest correctional firms and the company has prospered in recent years as President Donald Trump has promised a tough-on-crime agenda.</p>

<p>Shares of CoreCivic stock rose 3.5 percent last week on the day Trump signed the executive order ending migrant family separations at the border. Since April, the company, which also donated to the president’s inaugural committee, has seen its stock rise 20 percent since April 2.</p>

<p>CoreCivic did not respond to requests for clarification about who would be housed at the prison. A U.S. Marshals Service spokesperson also would not confirm who would be held at the Tallahatchie County facility.</p>

<p>In a recent report by the investment bank SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, analysts said the Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy toward migrants crossing the border will also prove profitable for private prison companies like CoreCivic. The subsequent rise in immigrant detainees could allow them to bypass the usual “cumbersome and lengthy public processes” that accompany contracts with the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Marketwatch reported June 25.</p>

<p>CoreCivic operates one other prison in Mississippi, the 2,232-bed Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, under a contract with the federal Bureau of Prisons. The federal prison bureau also operates a facility in Yazoo County.</p>

<p>During a 2004 riot at the Tallahatchie prison, inmates lit mattresses, clothing and a portable toilet on fire, leading the private operator to add 25 guards to the facility, the Associated Press reported at the time.</p>

<p>In May 2012, prisoners rioted at the Adams County Correctional Center, taking guards hostage and injuring other inmates, resulting in the death of one correctional officer. Several inmates have since been convicted for their roles in the incident.</p>

<p>In 2013, CoreCivic (then CCA) lost its contract with the state of Mississippi to operate the 1,000-bed Wilkinson County Correctional Facility. The contract was awarded to Utah-based private operator MTC instead, which now remains the only prison contractor for state-owned facilities.</p>

<p>According to the BOP website, the majority of inmates in contract prisons like the Adams County facility are “sentenced criminal aliens who may be deported upon completion of their sentence.”</p>

<p>On June 23, prison officials in South Carolina announced that 48 prisoners they characterized as disruptive would be moved to the Tallahatchie County facility, the Associated Press reported.</p>

<p>On a daily basis in 2017, the U.S. Marshals Service held an average of 50,532 prisoners, some 9,095 of which were housed in private facilities. As of that year, the marshals had 13 contracts with privately managed detention facilities.</p>

<h2 id="bariascoresdemocraticrunoffwinshermandeclinestoendorse">Baria scores Democratic runoff win; Sherman declines to endorse</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Ganucheau</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/26/baria-scores-democratic-runoff-win-sherman-declines-to-endorse/ </p>

<p>GULFPORT, Miss. — David Baria, a state representative and attorney from Bay St. Louis, won the Democratic runoff for U.S. Senate Tuesday night, helping Democrats avoid an embarrassing loss to a candidate major party officials declined to support.</p>

<p>Baria’s win also avoids putting party leaders in the thorny position of having to line up behind a candidate they attempted to paint as a Republican, which became a major rallying point during as the campaign drew to a close.</p>

<p>Baria defeated Howard Sherman, a venture capitalist from California and the husband of Mississippi actress Sela Ward, earning the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat Republican Sen. Roger Wicker currently holds.</p>

<p>Baria’s friends and family crowded Tuesday into Murky Waters BBQ restaurant in Gulfport, hovering around the tables of patrons who had results pulled up on their computers, checking for updates between bites of pulled pork.</p>

<p>Baria arrived about an hour into the party, when he concentrated on mingling with visitors. When supporters at the watch party heard media reports call the race for their candidate, people jumped out of their seats and screamed. The room immediately transformed into laughter and cheers and Baria went around the room hugging supporters.</p>

<p>He said he hopes to take some time off to rest, but that soon his team would assemble to talk strategy for November when both U.S. Senate seats open, including one officially nonpartisan special election. That contest features former Democratic Congressman and ag Secretary Mike Espy, who political observers expect to the race — where challengers include Republicans Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and state Sen. Chris McDaniel — competitive.</p>

<p>“I hope that now that the primary is over, assuming I win (after final votes are tallied), that folks can unite behind a candidate, come together and try to do some joint planning. Whereas we’ve kind of been fractured and sidelined … I think there’s a lot of enthusiasm on the Democratic side this time,” Baria told Mississippi Today on Tuesday.</p>

<p>“I’ve said that a number of times, but our folks are waiting. They’re chomping at the bit for this to be over with so we can really get going — so that will be exciting, to bring everybody together and start to talk to all Mississippians instead of just Democratic primary voters. I’m looking forward to having that conversation with all Mississippi voters.”</p>

<p>The state House minority leader, Baria, 55, is a third-term legislator and trial attorney. He beat incumbent state Sen. Scottie Cuevas in 2007, and later went on to win a seat in the House representing House District 122.</p>

<p>In the Legislature, Baria has been a consistent vote on most issues for the Democratic minority. Voters in November will decide between a clear ideological contrast in Baria’s liberal-leaning voting record and Wicker’s conservative bonafides.</p>

<p>Baria’s win also signifies a big win for the Democratic political establishment in the state, which publicly stuck their necks out for Baria’s candidacy.</p>

<p>Howard Sherman, right, and wife, Sela Ward, speak with reporters in Meridian after Sherman lost his bid to win the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate.</p>

<p>Adam Ganucheau, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Meridian, a single staffer for Howard Sherman sat at the downstairs bar of Weidmann’s restaurant downtown. Thirty minutes after the 8 p.m. watch party time listed on the evening’s invitation, a man wearing a Sherman campaign T-shirt appeared to be the only visible candidate at the restaurant.</p>

<p>In the restaurant’s upstairs bar, a couple dozen people gathered for the weekly trivia game, while several dozen people ate and kept to themselves in the main dining room of the restaurant.</p>

<p>Around 9:15 p.m., Sherman and Ward arrived to the restaurant. Several television reporters who were broadcasting the interview live on camera rushed to meet the couple at their van.</p>

<p>Ward, an unmovable presence on Sherman’s political advertisements and during the campaign, took the first questions from reporters. Throughout the interview with Sherman, a teary-eyed Ward interrupted to offer her perspective. Their college-aged daughter and son stood beside their parents as supporters inside the restaurant greeted them with applause.</p>

<p>“Our love for the state — the way we view it — is filled with enormous potential for change. A statement was made today: ‘We’re not ready for change. We’re not ready for a square peg in a round hole. We’re not ready for out-of-the-box solutions,'” Sherman told reporters, referring to Democratic voters. He added: “They voted for conventional. That’s what they voted for. There are tens of thousands of people that voted for change, that voted for a new wave, for that square peg.”</p>

<p>In the midst of his first ever political campaign, Sherman had pitched himself all year as the political outsider. But Sherman’s outsiderness raised eyebrows and drew rebuke from Democratic elected officials and operatives.</p>

<p>Just last year, Sherman gave the maximum allowed campaign contribution to Sen. Wicker, who he would have faced in November.</p>

<p>Sherman used the star power of his wife Sela Ward and a fat personal pocketbook – dropping $850,000 of his own money into his campaign – to reach Mississippians through television and radio advertisements. His campaign finance reports were lined with mostly out-of-state donors, swaths of whom reside in Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City.</p>

<p>“We love this state, and we have met the most amazing people. It has been an experience of joy and such pride to really see the state as a whole and all its potential. It’s bittersweet, but that’s life — and onward!,” Ward said.</p>

<p>Baria and Sherman entered into a run-off for the title of Democratic nominee after the June 5 primary. Sherman had earned the endorsement of third place candidate Rep. Omeria Scott, D-Laurel.</p>

<p>Rep. Sonya Williams-Barnes, D-Gulfport, supported her fellow Coast Democrat from the outset of his campaign and said the result was affirming for the party.</p>

<p>“We can do it for David; we can do it for ourselves,” she said. “I think it’s more than just tonight, it’s a larger win for the state.”</p>

<p>Asked who he would support in November, Sherman declined to endorse Baria, telling Mississippi Today: “It’s way too early. We’re still dealing with the emotions of it all. I’m not supporting Roger Wicker, but I’ve got to regroup.”</p>

<h2 id="keystatedemocratshelpedpass2007lawtobanabortionsifroeoverturned">Key state Democrats helped pass 2007 law to ban abortions if Roe overturned</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Bobby Harrison</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-28</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/29/key-state-democrats-helped-pass-2007-law-to-ban-abortions-if-roe-overturned/ </p>

<p>If President Donald Trump’s new nominee to the United States Supreme Court leads to the reversal of Roe v. Wade, an existing state law will be triggered prohibiting abortion in most instances in Mississippi.</p>

<p>The law, which would permit abortions only when the mother’s life is at risk and in cases of rape, was passed in 2007 by the Mississippi Legislature. Two of the legislators who played a key role in passage of the law are former Rep. Jamie Franks of Mooreville, who later served as chairman of the state Democratic Party, and Rep. Steve Holland, D-Plantersville.</p>

<p>At the time Holland was chair of the House Public Health Committee. Holland said when the legislation was passed out of his committee he was “fed up” with the multiple “not picky” bills anti-abortion advocates were trying to pass to limit abortions in the state.</p>

<p>“I thought we will settle this once and for all (by introducing legislation to ban abortions if Roe was overturned.) You don’t have to introduce another bill,” Holland said he told anti-abortion advocates.</p>

<p>The issue has come to the forefront with U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy’s announcement that he is retiring. Kennedy was a key swing vote on the court on many issues. Some observers say a new Trump appointee could lead to the reversal of the Roe v. Wade decision made in the early 1970s guaranteeing a woman’s right to an abortion.</p>

<p>Mississippi is one of four states with laws in place that immediately make abortion illegal if Roe v. Wade is overturned, according to a study by the Center for Reproductive Rights. The other states are Louisiana and North and South Dakota.</p>

<p>In 2007, late on a deadline day, Holland called a meeting of his Public Health Committee. He called up for consideration a bill dealing with parental notification before a minor could receive an abortion. Franks then added the amendment banning all abortions.</p>

<p>The law reads that it would go into effect “10 days following the date of publication by the attorney general of Mississippi that the attorney general has determined that the United States Supreme Court has overruled the decision of Roe v. Wade, and that it is reasonably probable that this section would be upheld by the Court as constitutional.”</p>

<p>The Jackson Women’s Health Organization clinic in the city’s Fondren neighborhood, pictured June 28, 2018.</p>

<p>One clinic, the Jackson Women’s Health Organization, performs abortions in the state. Holland is not pleased with the possibility of abortion being banned in Mississippi even though he played a key role in passing the 2007 bill.</p>

<p>“I have always thought women should decide that issue. As far as liking abortion, I don’t. I don’t think anybody does,” he said.</p>

<p>But Franks, who served three terms in the state House representing portions of Lee, Itawamba and Tishomingo counties, and was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 2007 said he was then and remains anti-abortion.</p>

<p>“I am a pro-life Democrat,” said Franks, who served as chair of the state Democratic Party in the 2000s and is current chair of the Lee County Democratic Executive Committee. “I believe we should value life.</p>

<p>He added: “The difference between me and Republicans is that Republicans believe we should protect life until we get them here, but do not want to protect life after that.”</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves told Mississippi Today: “I am committed to making Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child. This 2007 state law combined with President Trump’s commitment to appoint conservatives to the U.S. Supreme Court mean Mississippi will continue to provide the strongest protections for the lives of unborn children in America.”</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant said, “As I have repeatedly said, I want Mississippi to be the safest place in American for an unborn child by ending abortion here.”</p>

<p>Jameson Taylor, vice president for public policy for Mississippi Center for Public Policy, which has worked in the state Legislature to limit access to abortions, said the 2007 law “is not the type of law I tend to support. It is pretty abstract.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, Taylor said he does not think the Supreme Court – even with a new Trump appointee – would reverse Roe v Wade, but instead “move toward common sense protection,” in his view, such as limiting the amount of time where an abortion could be performed.</p>

<p>Laurie Roberts, co-founder and executive director of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, said she is familiar with the 2007 law. And fears Mississippi “will be in an abortion desert” because surrounding states will follow Mississippi and ban abortion and only wealthy people who can “fly someplace” will have access to an abortion.</p>

<p>She also said the 15-week abortion ban approved during the 2018 Mississippi legislative session is a new law that could result in a challenge that leads to the reversal of Roe.</p>

<p>Terri Herring, an anti-abortion lobbyist in Mississippi, said she remembers when the 2007 law was passed and that it could go into effect if Roe v. Wade is overturned. She also said there are multiple other Mississippi laws placing restrictions on abortions that have been blocked by the courts but could go into effect if the Court with a new justice stops short of overturning Roe, but does give states more authority to limit abortions.</p>

<p>“Make no mistake – the right to access abortion in this country is on the line,” said Staci Fox, chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood Southeast. She urged “the Senate to reject any nominee who would strip people’s individual rights and freedoms.”</p>

<h2 id="thatsnotwinningreportshedslightonskyrocketingfemaleimprisonment">‘That’s not winning’: Report sheds light on skyrocketing female imprisonment</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Michelle Liu</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-20</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/21/thats-not-winning-report-sheds-light-on-skyrocketing-female-imprisonment/ </p>

<p>Although they make up only 8 percent of Mississippi’s inmate population, women and girls in the state’s prisons and jails face a singular set of challenges today, a new report finds.</p>

<p>Not least of these challenges, per Washington, D.C.–based national advocacy group The Sentencing Project, are burgeoning law enforcement efforts, stricter drug sentencing laws and post-conviction barriers that affect women disproportionately.</p>

<p>Moreover, Mississippi’s rate of female incarceration rose 925 percent between 1978 and 2016, from 8 to 82 incarcerated women per 100,000 female residents. Mississippi now incarcerates women at a rate 1.5 times than the national average.</p>

<p>As of 2016, the most recent data available, Mississippi ranked 14th out of all states for the rate of female incarceration.</p>

<p>Researchers and advocates from The Sentencing Project, the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls, and two regional organizations based in Nashville and San Francisco sought to contextualize national and regional statistics with projects they’ve undertaken in specific cities and regions in a web panel Tuesday.</p>

<p>In seeking solutions for women and girls, panelists concurred that the process of securing justice should be rooted within communities, not the current courts system and its counterparts — foster care, the juvenile-justice system and government welfare programs.</p>

<p>“It’s not freedom when I have a young woman come to me who’s not in jail anymore but her kids were taken away on Thursday,” said Jessica Nowlan, executive director of the San Francisco-based Young Women’s Freedom Center. “That’s not winning.”</p>

<p>Nationally, 1.2 million women and girls are now under supervision of the criminal-justice system, with 1 million on probation or parole and another 200,000 women in local jails or state and federal prisons, said Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a senior research analyst at the Sentencing Project.</p>

<p>Most of these women have young children, she added — over 60 percent of women in state prisons have at least one child under age 18.</p>

<p>At a national level, the growth rate of incarcerated women doubles that of men, though women make up only about seven percent of the U.S. prison population. And African-American and Latina women are currently imprisoned at twice and 1.4 times the rate of white women, respectively.</p>

<p>In contrast to men, more than half of whom are imprisoned for violent offenses, most women are imprisoned for nonviolent crimes, per The Sentencing Project. Only 37 percent of women in state prisons in 2016 were convicted of a violent crime.</p>

<p>These numbers are mostly driven by local and state policies, thus yielding the wide range of imprisonment rates across states, Ghandnoosh said. At 149 per 100,000, Oklahoma ranks first, while Massachusetts and Rhode Island are tied for last at 13 per 100,000.</p>

<p>Mississippi Department of Corrections</p>

<p>A photo from the Mississippi Department of Corrections shows a female prisoner learning keyboarding skills.</p>

<p>Within Mississippi’s system, disparities have emerged between resources allocated for female and male inmates, as the Atlantic reported in April. The Mississippi Department of Correction’s website lists 13 vocational opportunities for men, such as auto mechanic and welding technology, and only five for women, including cosmetology and “Family Dynamics,” which is described as an expanded form of a home-economics class.</p>

<p>Other MDOC programs tailored for women include a recent re-entry workshop, backed by Arianna Huffington, businesswoman and co-founder of the Huffington Post, that uses “principles routinely applied in the corporate world.”</p>

<p>All women in MDOC state prisons are held at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County.</p>

<p>Andrea James, founder and executive director of the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls, posed the question: “How do we shift the system?”</p>

<p>“It involves finding ways to pull back from the current system and really engage communities in taking back their power,” James said. “Engage communities in being a part of the process of making decisions about what does justice look like for us? What do we want our communities to look like?”</p>

<p>Nowlan, of the San Francisco-based Young Women’s Freedom Center, provided a case study of work still needed for young, incarcerated women, even in California: “Still no housing, still in poverty, still having to do survival sex work,” she said. She cited incidents in which snatching phones or stealing laundry soap turned into felony charges.</p>

<p>Research conducted by the Freedom Center into the past 25 years has shown a “huge correlation” between homelessness and incarceration, foster homes and juvenile justice systems, Nowlan added.</p>

<p>Oleta Fitzgerald, Southern regional director for the Children’s Defense Fund in Jackson, links the plight of incarcerated women of color in Mississippi, particularly, to a dearth of economic opportunity, citing poverty as a driving force behind the state’s incarceration rate.</p>

<p>“When you intersect poverty, gender and race, you’ve got yourself something,” Fitzgerald told Mississippi Today.</p>

<p>That Mississippi is the poorest state in the nation, ACLU of Mississippi executive director Jennifer Riley Collins adds, means that most women who enter the criminal justice system are economically disadvantaged with little education, few job skills, and sporadic employment histories.</p>

<p>Gabriel Austin, Mississippi Today.</p>

<p>Jennifer Riley-Collins, executive director of the ACLU of Mississippi (center) speaks at a press conference.</p>

<p>Women leaving prison, Riley outlined in a statement, must stay clean and sober, return to a primary caretaker role for their children, earn a livable wage, obtain reliable childcare and transportation, and find safe and sober housing for themselves and their children. And all of this occurs while they try to meet requirements of community supervision and additional demands of other public agencies such as child welfare.</p>

<p>“Women need to be provided with a basic safety net: transportation, community spaces, housing, healthcare, education, employment, and economic security,” Riley said in a statement. “Without a safety net, women often are forced to return to a life of survival and are not afforded the opportunity to be restored.”</p>

<p>In organizing efforts to address the disruptive effects of incarceration on women and children, organizers have found it crucial to include the experiences of the incarcerated themselves.</p>

<p>“We don’t do anything — not one thing — without first reaching to the women and girls and (families) who are on the inside of the prison bunk,” James said.</p>

<h2 id="amidsocialmediaconfusionespyremainsneutralcallsbariashermangoodcandidates">Amid social media confusion, Espy remains neutral; calls Baria, Sherman good candidates</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Bobby Harrison</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/22/amid-social-media-confusion-espy-remains-neutral-calls-baria-sherman-good-candidates/ </p>

<p>Mike Espy, former Democratic congressman and cabinet secretary. He is running for the U.S. Senate.</p>

<p>Mike Espy has made it clear he is not endorsing a candidate in Tuesday’s U.S. Senate Democratic primary runoff, but will support the winner in the November general election.</p>

<p>Both David Baria and Howard Sherman, who are vying for the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination, have tried to align themselves with Espy. Espy, who in the 1980s became the first African American from Mississippi elected to the U.S. House since Reconstruction and then served as the Agriculture secretary in the Clinton administration, also will be on the ballot in November – in a special election to replace Thad Cochran who resigned from the Senate earlier this year.</p>

<p>Sherman and Baria are vying to face Republican incumbent Roger Wicker of Tupelo in the regularly scheduled Senate election.</p>

<p>In a statement, Espy said: “Everyone should understand that I am running my own race in the Nov. 6 special election for the vacant seat created by the departure of Sen. Cochran and that I have not endorsed either candidate in the runoff on Tuesday. “</p>

<p>But he encouraged people to go to the polls Tuesday and vote for one of the candidates.</p>

<p>“David and Howard are both right on the policies that matter to me and I have no doubt that both can win in November,” he said.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the person who replaced Espy as the 2nd District U.S. House member for Mississippi has made it clear who he is supporting in the runoff.</p>

<p>“I am endorsing David Baria. I’ve known him for a number of years and we’ve worked together on various pieces of legislation,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson of Bolton.</p>

<p>Thompson is running television and radio commercials for Baria during the final weekend of campaigning.</p>

<p>Thompson also made it clear that he believes Baria and Espy will be a strong combination in the November general elections.</p>

<p>“Given Trump’s proposals on tariffs, I feel Mike Espy and David Baria will do an excellent job combating Trump’s lackluster policies in the U.S. Senate,” he said of the president’s planned tariffs on China that could impact Mississippi farmers.</p>

<p>David Baria and Howard Sherman are vying for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate in a June 26 runoff.</p>

<p>Sherman, a venture capitalist from California, who now lives with his wife, Emmy-winning actress Sela Ward in her hometown of Meridian, narrowly won the first primary on June 5, but did not garner a majority needed to avoid the runoff.</p>

<p>Baria, a third-term state legislator from Bay St. Louis, is the House minority leader. He has made the endorsements he has received from many elected Democratic officials across the state a cornerstone of his campaign. A notable exception to those endorsements for Baria is state Rep. Omeria Scott of Laurel, who placed third in the first primary and opted to endorse Sheman in the runoff.</p>

<p>Espy’s clarification comes amid confusion about endorsements on social media. For instance, after social media conversation appeared to indicate the Democratic Party in Sherman’s home county of Lauderdale had endorsed Baria, the committee issued a statement saying it had made no official endorsement, though, some members of the committee had endorsed Baria.</p>

<p>Also on Tuesday voters in the 3rd Congressional district can go to the polls to choose in the Republican runoff between Michael Guest, the district attorney for Rankin and Madison counties, and Whit Hughes of Madison, a former hospital administrator and economic developer.</p>

<p>Guest led the first primary by a sizable margin, but failed to garner a majority in the primary where six candidates were looking to succeed Gregg Harper who is stepping down after representing the 3rd District 10 years in the House.</p>

<p>Guest has received a notable endorsement going into the runoff election from Republican Gov. Phil Bryant.</p>

<p>The winner of the Republican primary runoff will face Democrat Michael Evans, a state House member from Preston, in the November general election.</p>

<p>People who voted in one party primary on June 5 cannot vote in the other party runoff on Tuesday. But people who did not vote on June 5 can vote in either primary runoff, but not both, on Tuesday.</p>

<h2 id="collegeworldseriesstatesbillingsleyfacestoughesttaskyet">College World Series: State’s Billingsley faces toughest task yet</h2>

<p>Mike Strasinger / Associated Press</p>

<p>Jacob Billingsley pitches against Vanderbilt in the deciding game of the Nashville Super Regional.</p>

<p>OMAHA – On paper, it appears a mismatch: Mississippi State fifth-year senior pitcher Jacob Billingsley against a fearsome, power-packed Oregon State lineup that includes three first round choices in the recent Major League draft.</p>

<p>Billingsley, a walk-on five years ago out of Magnolia Heights School in Senatobia, will face an Oregon State lineup that includes three of the draft’s top 37 picks and six who were taken in the first 10 rounds. Billingsley, you should know, was picked in the 32nd round by the Houston Astros, the 972nd player chosen.</p>

<p>Here’s what the numbers say on paper: Billingsley, who will turn 24 next month, has a 4.92 earned run average, having given up 76 hits in 71.1 innings. Opponents hit a healthy .270 against him. None of those numbers are going to strike fear into the hearts and minds of the Beavers, who hit .322 as a team with 64 home runs in 63 games.</p>

<p>Now then here’s the good news where Mississippi State is concerned: Ameritrade Park, home of the College World Series is not made of paper. It’s a beautiful stadium with well-groomed Kentucky bluegrass turf. More glad tidings for State: Friday’s scheduled 2 p.m. game is a huge one, and Billingsley has a habit of being at his best when it matters most.</p>

<p>Mississippi State interim head coach Gary Henderson watches during College World Series practice Friday, June 15, 2018, in Omaha, Neb.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why but certain kids rise to the moment,” is the way Mississippi State coach Gary Henderson put it. “He has pitched well in big games. That’s why I have confidence in him, the team has confidence in him and hopefully he’ll go out and have another big performance for us tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Over the last two post-seasons, Billingsley has started three games with State’s season on the line. In other words, if he loses any of the three, State’s season is over. State has won all three, none bigger than the masterpiece he threw against Southern Miss last June in a NCAA Regional at Hattiesburg. Remember?</p>

<p>Southern Miss, already with 50 victories, was undefeated in the Regional. State lost its first game, had to advance through the losers’ bracket and was thin on pitching when the Bulldogs faced the Golden Eagles. The Dogs desperately needed several innings from Billingsley. They got a lot more than that. Indeed, they got a complete game, 8-1 victory, saving the State staff for an 8-6 championship win.</p>

<p>Yes, Henderson said, it was Billingsley’s best game to date. “It would be the best game for a whole lot of pitchers,” Henderson said. “It was a pivotal moment for JB and for our team.”</p>

<p>This spring, Billingsley got the start against Samford in the Tallahassee Regional in a do-or-die game. Billingsley did, picking up the win and going seven innings in the process. He got the start in the deciding Game 3 against Vanderbilt in the Super Regional. He allowed two runs in three innings – not his best performance – but, again, State got the win.</p>

<p>“Every time I go out, I’m trying to give it my best,” Billingsley said Thursday after State’s short practice at Creighton University’s ballpark. “But games like this one are where younger guys might get sped up and caught up in the moment. You just have to treat it like it’s just another game – like a midweek game or an SEC game.”</p>

<p>That has to be hard to do if you take a glance at Oregon State’s stat sheet. The Beavers’ slugging percentage is a ridiculously good .495. By comparison, State’s is .409. Oregon State is located in Corvallis, roughly 2,500 miles from Starkville, but even the Bulldogs noticed them from nearly a continent away.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen it all year,” Billingsley said. “They can really swing it. . . . But coming from the SEC, we face that kind of lineup all the time so we won’t change anything about our approach.”</p>

<p>The Beavers are hot. After losing their CWS opener, they have scored 25 runs in back-to-back victories. Oregon State pounded out 13 hits, four doubles and three home runs in an 11-6 victory over North Carolina in a Wednesday night elimination game. Monday night, they raked for 16 hits in a 14-5 trouncing of Washington.</p>

<p>Billingsley’s job is to give the Bulldogs some solid innings and then hand it over to a bullpen that has been exceedingly good in the post-season. Win Friday and the Bulldogs advance to CWS championship series beginning Monday night. If they lose, they have to turn around and play Oregon State again Saturday.</p>

<p>Said Billingsley, “I’ve been waiting on this moment and dreaming about it since I was a kid. . . . I am super excited.”</p>

<p>Last week on “The Jungle: Mississippi Today’s Election Podcast,” we interviewed state Rep. David Baria and businessman Howard Sherman, and asked each candidate seeking the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senate the following question: “What do you perceive to be the biggest struggles facing African Americans in Mississippi, and how might you address those problems if you were elected to the U.S. Senate?”</p>

<p>Because African Americans are a vital bloc in the Democratic electorate and the candidates are working hard to court black support, we are publishing their responses to that question in full below.</p>

<p>In this March 10, 2015 file photograph, Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, speaks at the well in House chambers at the Capitol.</p>

<p>David Baria, state representative and attorney</p>

<p>“Well, first and foremost, African Americans in our state continue to struggle from failed policy and years of systemic racism that keep African Americans from getting jobs they are qualified for and need and reaching the income levels that they need. So you end up with these generational cycles of poverty, and it’s very difficult to break out of that. In underserved communities, both black and white, there aren’t the resources you have in other places around the state like the Gulf Coast or Madison County or DeSoto County. We’ve got to dedicate resources to those areas of our state where it’s difficult to attract jobs and industry and people because they don’t have the facilities they’re looking for. Whether that’s a school system, hospital, or a good road. We have to address those things.”“I think, actually, it’s going to be easier to address them from Washington because you have a little more leeway in terms of the federal dollars you can send home. Keep in mind, our education system here in Mississippi couldn’t survive without federal dollars. Our transportation system couldn’t survive without federal dollars. Our healthcare system couldn’t survive without federal dollars.”“The other thing folks need to know about me is when I go to Washington, my office, staff and team is going to reflect the composition of the state of Mississippi. I’m going to elevate deserving folks, regardless of race, creed, or color, but I’m going to make sure my staff is reflective of this state that I serve. And I’m going to change the conversation about race. As I know you’re aware, I have a biracial child. For me, it’s not a lived experience, but it’s a learned experience what a person of color goes through in this state and in this country. That’s what folks need to know about me, and I’m going to change the conversation about race.”</p>

<p>Howard Sherman campaign</p>

<p>Howard Sherman, businessman</p>

<p>“It’s the fundamentals. They care about jobs. You know, it’s so interesting because I’ll be in one part of the Delta and they’ll say, “I really want jobs.” I had a meeting with Congressman Bennie Thompson in Washington, and he heard all my ideas about medical tourism and Mississippi Math and our idea village. He said, “That’s good but those are longer term solutions. Those are not solutions that you can hit it on a dime.” He said, “What can you do for me now because we need jobs? Our unemployment rate is double what it is in the (country).” I said, “I have an idea, give me a couple weeks.”“So I went back and I worked my network of people that I know and I found a corn chip company on the west coast. I got this idea that we should really rebrand the Delta – because we grow so much incredible stuff – as the farm-to-table part of the country. So I called the CEO of the corn chip company and I said, “I need you to open a factory in the Delta on the edge of a corn field.” He says, “Why would I do that?” I said, “Because you’re probably fighting in the market to differentiate yourself – make the consumer see you as different – from Frito-Lay and Doritos and all that.” He said, “Yeah, we fight for colors and message and all that.” I said, “How about a message that says ‘Freshest chip on the market.’ Within 48 hours, you go from field to bag. Literally have the factory on the edge of a corn field.” He said, “Oh my, I pay all my marketing people, but in this one phone call, it’s 1,000 jobs.”“So that’s how you do it. We have to bring jobs to the African American parts. They want vocational training, of course. There are core programs that can fund it, as long as you match it to a company coming in. So we’ll use some core funding. I also have a bank that will fund vocational training as long as they can get a commitment from the local municipalities who’ll now enjoy higher taxes to repay the loan. So they’ll advance $100,000 to train an African American or any workforce, but then the company relocates the factory there. It generates jobs, that creates a tax base and the local municipality takes incremental money they weren’t getting anyway, repays the bank. You have jobs, you have a tax base.”</p>

<p>Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Omeria Scott endorses U.S. Senate candidate Howard Sherman for the June 26 runoff.</p>

<p>Two days after the June 5 primary, Howard Sherman hopped on Interstate 59 in Meridian and headed south to Laurel with a mission: To earn the endorsement of Rep. Omeria Scott.</p>

<p>Sherman knew Scott’s endorsement would be critical in the coming runoff between himself and state Rep. David Baria.</p>

<p>Scott, who is a African American and a longtime state representative, earned 20,000 votes but did not make the runoff. With fewer than 1,000 votes separating Sherman and Baria on June 5, those 20,000 votes could more than swing the election. So he and his wife, Sela Ward, drove to Laurel to take Scott out to dinner.</p>

<p>“I think within 10 minutes, there was tears,” Sherman told Mississippi Today. “Her and Sela connected on such a primal level, woman-to-woman, and she and I connected on the idea level. We had a real kumbaya moment and she said, ‘I really want to endorse you. I really want to see the state move and progress.’”</p>

<p>The next day, on the steps of Laurel City Hall, Scott publicly endorsed Sherman.</p>

<p>As Baria and Sherman enter the final week before the runoff, it’s clear that their campaigns are striving to line up the support of black voters.</p>

<p>In Mississippi, and nationally, black voters are the bedrock of the Democratic voting base. In Mississippi, three out of four Democratic primary voters are African American. The runoff candidates – both of whom are white – have proven they understand the need for endorsements and public support from black political influencers.</p>

<p>Bobby Harrison / Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Rep. David Baria, center, facing a runoff against Howard Sherman to see who takes on Sen. Roger Wicker, rallied support from state Democrats.</p>

<p>While Sherman wooed Scott, Baria and his campaign team worked their own phones.</p>

<p>Less than a week after the primary, Baria gave a press conference, flanked by a dozen members of the Legislative Black Caucus.</p>

<p>Before the primary, several members of the black caucus told Mississippi Today they couldn’t vocalize their support of Baria because Scott, their legislative colleague, was also in the race. When she failed to make the runoff, members of the black caucus met with Baria to discuss their approach and strategy on how to get voters in their home districts to vote for Baria.</p>

<p>“David (Baria) is a strong democratic voice in the Mississippi legislature,” said Rep. Robert Johnson, D-Natchez. “We need his intellect, understanding of policy and legislative process and his commitment to social and equal justice in the U.S. Senate.”</p>

<p>U.S. House</p>

<p>Baria’s support among Democratic officials seems to be solidifying. Recently, U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson – long regarded the most powerful and influential black politician in the state – took the dramatic step this week of returning a campaign contribution Sherman made earlier this year, reported Arielle Dreher of the Jackson Free Press.</p>

<p>“Well, it would have been, I think, disingenuous on my part to take a contribution from someone who’s running for office that I’m not supporting because it could be construed that I am,” Thompson told the JFP.</p>

<p>African Americans make up 38 percent of the state’s population, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau — the highest percentage of any state and, therefore, making black Mississippians among the most influential voting blocs in statewide Democratic politics anywhere.</p>

<p>As a result, even in the Republican-controlled state Legislature, there are 52 black lawmakers in the state House and Senate. Thompson is the only black delegate representing Mississippi in Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>“African Americans in our state continue to struggle from failed policy and years of systemic racism that keep African Americans from getting jobs they are qualified for and need and reaching the income levels that they need,” Baria said recently on “The Jungle: Mississippi Today’s Election Podcast,” when asked about addressing challenges facing African Americans in the state.</p>

<p>He added: “So you end up with these generational cycles of poverty, and it’s very difficult to break out of that. In underserved communities, both black and white, there aren’t the resources you have in other places around the state like the Gulf Coast or Madison County or DeSoto County.”</p>

<p>Sherman, who struck a similar chord, also stresses the need to expand economic opportunity.</p>

<p>“We have to bring jobs to the African American parts (of the state). They want vocational training, of course. There are core programs that can fund it as long as you match it to a company coming in,” Sherman said on Mississippi Today’s podcast, in a separate interview.</p>

<p>Because African Americans are a vital bloc in the Democratic electorate, we asked each candidate in an upcoming runoff for U.S. Senate how they would address issues of concern to black Mississippians</p>

<p>Sherman added that wants to lure employers by working with a bank to advance funding for vocational training; once the employer relocates and begins hiring local workers, the municipality would pay back the loan.</p>

<p>“It generates jobs — that creates a tax base and the local municipality takes incremental money they weren’t getting anyway, repays the bank. You have jobs, you have a tax base,” Sherman said.</p>

<p>Some Mississippi political operatives hope to replicate several methods to get black voters to the polls during the 2017 special U.S. Senate election in Alabama, where Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican candidate and former judge Roy Moore.</p>

<p>Several new political groups formed in Alabama like Woke Vote, a program founded to get millennials out to vote. The group went to historically black colleges and universities and churches across Alabama to mobilize students and black women to vote.</p>

<p>Several NAACP chapters in Alabama called voters and went door-to-door encouraging African Americans to vote. Utilizing a text message campaign, the organization said it reached more than 160,000 African-Americans across the state and that 90 percent of the people reached said they would vote.</p>

<p>After the election, black women were largely credited for Jones win. Exit polling data showed that 96 percent of black women voted for Jones, and 93 percent of black men backed him.</p>

<p>“If you focus on African-American women you will bring along the men. The key factor is African-American women are influencers in our communities and in our households. And as men, we listen to our wives and we listen to our daughters,” Alabama House Minority Leader Anthony Daniels told NBC News shortly after the election.</p>

<p>Laurie Roberts, founder of the Mississippi Reproductive Fund, said to court black voters candidates have to do more than publicize endorsements of high-profile African American supporters.</p>

<p>“There is this notion that black people are this monolith and if one black leader puts out the call, then we say, ‘Oh O.K., this is who with we’re with.’ But we don’t just randomly follow everything that comes out of prominent black peoples’ mouths,” Roberts said.</p>

<p>Mississippi Democratic Party</p>

<p>Jacqueline Amos, state field director for the Mississippi Democratic Party, said candidates can get the attention — and votes — of black women by meeting them where they are.</p>

<p>“Go to meetings, go knock on their door, meet them in groups of three or four. Craft the message to what they are lacking, what you can do for that,” she said.</p>

<p>“Don’t continue telling us what the problems are. We need to know: Do you have solution?”</p>

<h2 id="govphilbryantreceivessonsofconfederateveteransheritageaward">Gov. Phil Bryant receives Sons of Confederate Veterans heritage award</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Ganucheau</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-17</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/18/gov-phil-bryant-receives-sons-of-confederate-veterans-heritage-award/ </p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant sits under a flag display, with both the American flag and the Mississippi state flag, Thursday, Sept. 1, 2016.</p>

<p>Echoes of “Dixie” rang through the conference room at Beauvior on Saturday as the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans opened their annual reunion with a booming a capella rendition of the Confederate battle song.</p>

<p>A while later, the banquet began and featured a high-profile award recipient: Gov. Phil Bryant.</p>

<p>Though Bryant, a dues-paying member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, did not attend the event, he was honored on Saturday with the group’s annual Gov. John J. Pettus Heritage Award.</p>

<p>“We’re an organization trying to promote the true Southern history, and we wanted to honor Gov. Bryant for his role in doing that,” said Jeff Barnes, leader of the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans. “Really, it’s for the proclamations of Confederate Heritage Month. That’s why we honored him.”</p>

<p>Bryant has signed state proclamations declaring April as “Confederate Heritage Month” each year since he became governor in 2012. Those proclamations have carried on a tradition started by former Gov. Kirk Fordice in 1993 – the same year Mississippi began recognizing Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p>

<p>Fordice was also a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans.</p>

<p>The group’s activities in Mississippi range from maintaining Civil War cemeteries and Confederate monuments to helping people trace their genealogical history. In recent weeks, the group has put their weight behind a ballot initiative aiming to cement the current state flag – which is the last in the nation containing the Confederate battle emblem – in the state’s constitution.</p>

<p>Bryant is a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans’ Rankin County’s Lowry Rifles Camp #1740. That membership makes him the most prominent sitting public official in the United States who is a known member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks the SCV and similar Confederate-affiliated groups.</p>

<p>Bryant has never commented on his membership in the group, and his office did not comment on the recent award when asked by Mississippi Today.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t attend regular meetings, but his dues are paid and his membership status is current,” Marc Allen, Mississippi SCV public affairs officer and a member of the same chapter as Bryant, said last year. “Gov. Bryant has Confederate ancestors like many people in Mississippi do. This is one way we can honor and pay respect to American veterans.”</p>

<p>As violent events like the 2015 Charleston church shooting and the 2017 Charlottesville protests have reignited conversations about changing the Mississippi state flag, Bryant, whose state-issued SUV has a state flag license tag on the front, has pointed back to the 2001 referendum in which the state’s voters decided nearly 2-to-1 to keep the current state flag.</p>

<p>“Whatever the state flag is or is not should be decided by Mississippi voters,” Bryant said in 2017.</p>

<p>The June 9 event in which Bryant was held at Beauvior, the Biloxi home of Confederate States of America President Jefferson Davis, and honored several of the group’s members through various awards, including the Gen. Nathaniel Bedford Forrest Compatriot of the Year Award and the Col. William H. Moore Recruiter of the Year Award.</p>

<p>The award Bryant received is named after Mississippi Gov. John J. Pettus, who served as governor between 1859-1863. A staunch secessionist, Pettus is the governor who led Mississippi out of the United States of America and into the Confederacy.</p>

<p>Mississippi historian David Sansing, who wrote a book in 2016 titled “Mississippi Governors: Soldiers Statesmen Scholars Scoundrels,” wrote of Pettus: “After General Robert E. Lee’s surrendered at Appomattox, Governor Pettus refused to surrender and settled in Arkansas where he continued to resist federal military authorities until his death on January 28, 1867.”</p>

<p>Before the Sons of Confederate Veterans’ banquet on June 9, the group hosted their annual business meeting, complete with an old-timey Confederate color guard, dressed in red shirts, white pants and straw hats. A couple color guard members carried rifles.</p>

<p>“It’s an honor he (Gov. Bryant) would be part of our group, and we were happy to honor him last weekend,” Barnes said.</p>

<h2 id="in133yearsofmississippistatebaseballweveneverseenanythingquitelikethis">In 133 years of Mississippi State baseball, we’ve never seen anything quite like this</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Rick Cleveland</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-10</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/11/in-133-years-of-mississippi-state-baseball-weve-never-seen-anything-quite-like-this/ </p>

<p>NASHVILLE – They’ve played baseball at Mississippi State for 133 years now. It’s a rich, storied history, so much richer now that the 2018 Diamond Dogs have accomplished what seemed so unthinkable just two months ago.</p>

<p>State outlasted Vanderbilt 10-6 in 11 innings Sunday night – and early Monday morning – to win a Super Regional for the ages. State won a walk-off victory Friday night. Vandy won in a walk-off Saturday night and then State won the extra inning classic that ended at 12:20 a.m. Monday.</p>

<p>It ended with a celebration for the ages. State players went, well, bananas. They began throwing their caps and gloves into the air. They high-fived and hugged and then risked life and limb in a huge dog-pile just to the left of second base. They paraded around the outfield waving to the bleachers where their fans hugged and high-fived, some in tears.</p>

<p>Later this week, the Bulldogs will head to Omaha and the College World Series — State’s 10th CWS trip in school history. The stage will be bigger, but nothing in Omaha could be more competitive, more compelling than this was.</p>

<p>Said Vanderbilt coach Tim Corbin, “It was like you were running a race with somebody and every time you sped up, they just sped up and went that much faster. You gotta give them credit. They came to our place, they battled and they won, fair and square.”</p>

<p>Said State interim coach Gary Henderson, “I told our team that they will remember this season – and what they have accomplished – for the rest of their lives.”</p>

<p>This was a season that began with State losing three straight games at Southern Miss and then losing their head coach a day later. They lost their first three SEC games to Vanderbilt. They lost seven of their first nine SEC games, period.</p>

<p>“Everybody gave up on us but us,” Jake Mangum, the team’s centerfielder, leadoff hitter and emotional leader, said. “Now, we gotta keep it going in Omaha.”</p>

<p>State will play Washington Saturday in the first round.</p>

<p>So many storylines:</p>

<p>• How about Henderson and his coaching staff, who not only held things together in the face of all that early adversity but also nurtured a young team to steady improvement throughout April, May and now June?</p>

<p>“What an honor it is to be the head coach at Mississippi State,” Henderson said. “I couldn’t be more proud…this has been the ride of a lifetime.”</p>

<p>Said Mangum, “Coach Henderson took over and he gave us an identity when we had none.”</p>

<p>Praise came from the other dugout. Said Corbin, “Gary and his staff have done a marvelous job with this team. … They’ve gone through a tough set of circumstances but they rose above it – and maybe because of it.”</p>

<p>• How about sturdy relief pitcher Cole Gordon, who covered seven innings of shutout baseball in the two Bulldog Super Regional victories, including 3.2 innings Sunday night? There were several valuable Bulldogs in this series, but Gordon surely was the most valuable. “Oh yeah,” Jake Mangum said, “Cole was our MVP. It was a team effort, but he allowed us to be in this position. When it was crunch time, he stepped up big-time.”</p>

<p>Corbin, again: “Cole’s a gutty kid. He slowed our momentum in both the games we lost. When you look at them winning, he had a whole lot to do with it.”</p>

<p>Mike Strasinger, Associated Press</p>

<p>Mississippi State’s Jake Mangum rounds third base on his way in to score against in the third inning.</p>

<p>• How about Mangum, the heart and soul of these Bulldogs, who began the week by essentially being spurned by Major League teams in the draft, and ended it by helping State win with his bat, his glove, his arm and his speed? Said Corbin, “What more can you say? Mangum’s Mangum.”</p>

<p>• How about Vanderbilt? In a series this compelling, it takes two teams to make it that way. In the seventh and eighth innings the Commodores made a series of defensive plays – four to be exact – that could be SportsCenter plays of the day.</p>

<p>Mangum, again, “Both these teams deserve to go to Omaha.</p>

<p>• And how about how State blew a three-run lead in the bottom of the ninth inning, but then rallied for four runs in the top of the 11th. When you look at all State overcame during this season, it seems perfectly reasonable that they would need to go to extra innings in order to punch the ticket to Omaha.</p>

<p>Said Mangum, “I thought to myself (after Vandy rallied to tie it in the ninth), ‘Well, of course, makes sense, why wouldn’t we go to extra innings?’”</p>

<p>Why indeed?</p>

<p>It all goes together to make the upcoming Omaha trip all the more special.</p>

<p>The Bulldogs posed for an impromptu team photo after their wild celebration.</p>

<h2 id="debatedramarepublicanpartychapterturnsupheatforcongressionaldebate">Debate drama: Republican Party chapter turns up heat for congressional debate</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Ganucheau</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-10</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/11/debate-drama-republican-party-chapter-turns-up-heat-for-congressional-debate/ </p>

<p>The Hinds County Republican Party announced on Monday they will host a debate on Thursday between third congressional runoff candidates Michael Guest and Whit Hughes.</p>

<p>The only problem: Guest won’t be there. After the announcement on Monday, the Guest campaign doubled down on their insistence they wouldn’t debate Hughes before the June 26 runoff.</p>

<p>“After already participating in 12 debates and forums with our opponent during this campaign, including three in Hinds County, Michael Guest will continue traveling throughout the entire third district to meet with voters directly to discuss the key issues affecting our country,” said Rob Pillow, Guest’s communications director.</p>

<p>“Obviously, our opponent is not going to dictate our schedule any more than we would attempt to dictate his schedule,” Pillow said.</p>

<p>Guest and Hughes earned the most votes of six total Republican candidates for the state’s third congressional seat on June 5, setting up a June 26 runoff between the two. Guest flirted with an outright win, earning 45 percent of the vote, while Hughes earned 22 percent of the vote.</p>

<p>The winner of the runoff will face Rep. Michael Evans — who won the Democratic primary — in the race to fill the House seat left vacant by retiring Rep. Gregg Harper.</p>

<p>Several times since the June 5 primary, Hughes has publicly challenged Guest to at least two debates before the runoff. Guest’s campaign has emphatically said they would not debate. </p>

<p>Hughes, in turn, has used Guest’s refusal to debate as a main talking point on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Adam Ganucheau, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>“For months, people have assumed this race would go to a runoff and there would be debates in the runoff,” Hughes said in a campaign email on Friday. “Now, my opponent, Michael Guest, has refused to debate me. … I respect Michael, but I also respect the voters and their desire to hear from us in a debate setting.”</p>

<p>The Hinds County GOP is one of the largest Republican Party county chapters in the state. Pete Perry, who is the chairman of the Hinds County GOP, is also a Hinds County campaign chairman for Hughes’ campaign.</p>

<p>Perry did not immediately return a call to Mississippi Today for comment on Monday.</p>

<p>“The Republican Party prides itself on being the party of ideas, we intend to showcase the ideas of these two candidates, both similarities and differences,” Perry said in the news release announcing the “debate.”</p>

<p>Amile Wilson, secretary for the Hinds County GOP, told Mississippi Today on Monday that invitations to the runoff debate had been sent to all six candidates in the race “about a month ago.” Wilson said five of the six candidates, excluding Guest, previously agreed to the debate.</p>

<p>“Michael Guest still has not confirmed he’ll attend,” Wilson told Mississippi Today on Monday afternoon. “Pete Perry and I will get together to figure that out (if he doesn’t attend). If we still don’t have a go-ahead from Guest, I’m not exactly sure what we’ll do on Thursday.”</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/09/i-found-myself-missing-home-a-utica-photo-essay/ </p>

<p>UTICA, Miss. — The state’s largest city, Jackson offers a fast-paced environment with access to culture, dining, entertainment, and luxuries that most city dwellers could not imagine going without.But, 35 miles away, the small town of Utica has few of the capital’s amenities even though they are located in the same county. For example, after the local Sunflower closed in fall 2014, the nearest grocery store where residents can purchase healthy food is nearly 19 miles away.</p>

<p>Utica is a predominately African-American rural town with a population of 869, according to U.S. Census estimates, tucked away in the southwest corner of Hinds County.

<p>Omeria Scott endorses U.S. Senate candidate Howard Sherman for the June 26 runoff.</p>

<p>Eric J. Shelton, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Rep. Omeria Scott, D-Laurel, who earned 20,000 votes in Tuesday’s Democratic Senate primary but did not make the runoff, endorsed candidate Howard Sherman on Friday.</p>

<p>Scott, a longtime state representative who came in third place behind Sherman and state House minority leader David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, made the announcement in her hometown Friday afternoon. She called for her supporters to cast votes for Sherman in the June 26 runoff.</p>

<p>“This is a time for unity,” Scott said in a release from the Sherman campaign. “I urge every one of my supporters and every Democrat in our state to come together and get behind Howard Sherman. His ideas for our state are bold and powerful, and I know he’s the right leader to defeat Roger Wicker and join with Mike Espy to bring change to Washington.”</p>

<p>“I’m energized and ready to fight alongside Howard and Sela as we approach the run-off and then on to November,” Scott’s statement continued. “This is a critical moment in our state’s history. I know how much Howard Sherman has done for our state and our community. And I know what kind of positive change he’ll bring as our Senator.”</p>

<p>Scott won 20 of the state’s 82 counties outright on Tuesday, including her home county of Jones. In the counties that Scott won, Sherman’s average percent of total vote was 22 percent, while Baria’s was 20 percent.</p>

<p>The endorsement could likely be a coup for Sherman, an entrepreneur who is married to actress Sela Ward. Precinct data shows that Sherman did well among African American voters on Tuesday, but Scott’s endorsement might carry some weight in the black community.</p>

<p>Baria, an attorney, previously earned the public endorsements of nearly every member of the Legislative Black Caucus. When asked for comment before Tuesday’s primary, no member of the black caucus spoke publicly in favor of Scott.</p>

<p>“I want to thank Omeria Scott for her continuing leadership and public service,” Sherman said in a statement. “I enjoyed campaigning alongside her in the primary. She is a positive force, and she is always focused on the issues and doing what’s best for the people.”</p>

<p>Baria described serving with Scott in the state House of Representatives a privilege.</p>

<p>“I respect her decision. We hope she encourages Howard Sherman to accept our invitation to participate in a televised/live stream debate so that the citizens of Mississippi can see the candidates, hear their views and make an informed decision,” Baria said in a statement.</p>

<p>The winner of the June 26 primary will face incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker in November.</p>

<h2 id="lawsuitgovoversteppedhisauthoritywhenheslashedmaepbudget">Lawsuit: Gov. overstepped his authority when he slashed MAEP budget</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Kayleigh Skinner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-06-05</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/06/lawsuit-gov-overstepped-his-authority-when-he-slashed-maep-budget/ </p>

<p>Two Democratic legislators are suing Gov. Phil Bryant for what they argue is an overstep of his constitutional powers that hurt Mississippi’s public school funding formula.</p>

<p>Mississippi House of Representatives</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Southern Poverty Law Center participated in oral arguments in the Mississippi Supreme Court on behalf of Rep. Bryant Clark of Pickens and Sen. John Horne of Jackson.</p>

<p>The complaint was filed in May 2017 against the governor, Department of Finance and Administration executive director Laura Jackson, the Mississippi Department of Education, and state treasurer Lynn Fitch.</p>

<p>It argues that the governor’s repeated budget cuts in fiscal year 2017 that stripped funds from the Mississippi Adequate Education Program, the chronically underfunded public school funding formula, was unconstitutional. The suit argues that only the Legislature has budget making authority.</p>

<p>In September 2016, Bryant enacted a $56.8 million budget cut to offset an accounting error. In January 2017 he was forced to cut the budget again, this time by $50.9 million due to low tax revenue projections. A month later, Bryant cut the budget for a third time because of continued low projections. This $43 million cut included the MAEP. In March 2017 he cut the budget for a fourth time by $20.5 million, once again for continued low tax revenue projections.</p>

<p>The complaint argues “these midyear budget cuts have devastated nearly every area of state government, but none more so than the Mississippi public schools.”</p>

<p>The Mississippi Adequate Education Program is consistently the biggest chunk of the state budget legislators craft every spring, topping out at over $2 billion annually. Despite this, the formula has only been fully funded twice since 1997, and the Supreme Court decided last fall that the state is not legally required to do so. The budget cuts in fiscal year 2017 cut the agency by approximately $20 million.</p>

<p>“I believe that the Mississippi Adequate Education Program (MAEP) is the most important component of the state budget,” Horhn said in a statement. “I do not know what analysis was conducted that allowed the Governor to conclude that schools did not need this $20 million. Schools need this money. Without sufficient resources, school districts are unable to educate our children.”</p>

<p>The SPLC lawsuit requests the Supreme Court strike down the statute of the Mississippi Constitution that allows the state fiscal officer, who is appointed by the governor, to cut the budget when there is a shortfall in revenue. It is the governor’s job to keep the state budget balanced.</p>

<p>Kayleigh Skinner/Mississippi Today</p>

<p>During oral arguments, SPLC attorney Will Bardwell said these cuts violate Mississippi’s constitutional rules about the separation of legislative and executive powers.</p>

<p>“Any decision that affects how much money is available to an agency is a legislative decision,” Bardwell said.</p>

<p>This case is not about whether agencies must spend every dollar they are appropriated, he said. If an agency can do everything it is required to without reaching its spending limit that is not an issue, but “it is a completely different situation when another branch of government comes in and changes that spending limit.”</p>

<p>In the defense’s oral argument, attorney Krissy Nobile from the attorney general’s office (which represents state entities) said the SPLC’s argument was filled with “word play” and the governor was acting within his rights to keep the state budget balanced.</p>

<p>“The Legislature here holds all of the important cards when it comes to making appropriations, when it comes to spending authorities, when it comes to budget making,” Nobile said. “But the governor, the governor has the cards when it comes to budget control, and the parameters and statute set forth these two things.”</p>

<p>Clark told Mississippi Today the state’s argument “doesn’t hold water” and he believes the governor is exceeding his constitutional authority.</p>

<p>“Making a choice by the executive branch to reduce spending is one thing, but to actually take money away from an agency that has been appropriated money is something totally different and left to the Legislature,” he said.</p>

<p>Both parties now wait on the Supreme Court to review their arguments and make a decision.</p>

<h2 id="bariashermanrunoffpitsveteranlawmakeragainsthollywoodsbigbucks">Baria, Sherman runoff pits veteran lawmaker against Hollywood’s big bucks</h2>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/06/05/baria-sherman-runoff-pits-veteran-lawmaker-against-hollywood-big-bucks/ </p>

<p>A nail-biter of a Democratic primary for U.S. Senate sets up a runoff election in three weeks between a veteran legislator and the spouse of a Mississippi-born actress.</p>

<p>The home stretch, which included appearances at one of Jackson’s largest black churches and an uptick in radio advertising, seemed to pay off for Rep. David Baria, the minority leader in the Mississippi House, and venture capitalist Howard Sherman.</p>

<p>In official results, Baria and Sherman finished as the top two vote getters after spending most of the evening neck-and-neck, mostly with Baria narrowly leading until the final moments before the Associated Press called the election a runoff with Sherman in the first-place seat.</p>

<p>Alex J. Berliner, ABImages via AP</p>

<p>“What I discovered over the last three weeks is when you advance a program and people haven’t had a chance to meet you, given that I come to this situation with a very different background, it’s important to keep doing that. The next three weeks will be putting a person to the ideas. The goal is to continue to have people meet me and give people that one degree of separation,” Sherman told Mississippi Today by phone.</p>

<p>Baria said he was thankful to be in the runoff, but did not mention his opponent by name when he spoke to Mississippi Today.</p>

<p>Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, speaks at the well in House chambers at the Capitol in 2015. </p>

<p>“I want to begin by thanking my friend and colleague Representative Omeria Scott for running a strong campaign with limited funds. I have served with Rep. Scott and I appreciate her leadership,” Baria said.</p>

<p>The results also reveal the highest voter turnout in a Democratic midterm primary for U.S. Senate since 2006, when 104,804 Democrats voted. That year, Erik Fleming and Bill Bowlin ended up in runoff which Fleming ultimately won.</p>

<p>Leading up to the primary, many Democrats and Black Caucus House members endorsed Baria.</p>

<p>Immediately after the runoff was called, Scott, a 25-year veteran of the Legislature, told Mississippi Today she was proud of her race and offered congratulations to Baria and Sherman. Scott did not say whether she would endorse either candidate. When asked if she thought either had a chance in November against incumbent Sen. Roger Wicker, she said:</p>

<p>“I’m going to be very honest — I always thought that I had the better chance to win. But the Democrats did not think that.”</p>

<p>The shadow of 2015</p>

<p>Political observers predicted the contest be tight given the legislative experience of Baria and his colleague, Scott, who could also appeal to African Americans and women who are the bedrock of the Democratic electorate.</p>

<p>Sherman, meanwhile, had vast enough financial resources to loan his campaign at least $500,000 and is married to Sela Ward, a Meridian native and Emmy-award-winning actress who remains popular in her home state.</p>

<p>Early Tuesday, no Democratic operatives felt confident in predicting an outcome of Tuesday’s primary. Most expected a runoff between two of the three top candidates. Even the state’s longtime Democratic elected officials seemed unsure how Tuesday would go.</p>

<p>Democratic operatives also quietly feared that low turnout could give way to a surprise reminiscent of a few years ago. The last time Democratic voters went to the polls in a statewide primary, the clear establishment pick in the 2015 gubernatorial race got beat by Robert Gray, a truck driver who spent no money on his campaign and didn’t even vote.</p>

<p>Three years later, those memories haunted the Mississippi Democratic Party. Conventional wisdom and campaign trends indicated all along that Baria, Scott, and Sherman – had the best shot at the nomination.</p>

<p>“I expect one of those main three (Baria, Scott, and Sherman) will pull it out, but I guess the bottom line is you just never know,” Vicki Slater, who lost to Gray, told Mississippi Today earlier on Election Day. “I may have to eat my words tomorrow. I guess we’ll see.”</p>

<p>The 2015 primary disaster was heavy on the minds of Democratic officials and operatives as voters trickled to the polls.</p>

<p>Gray, who ran a low-budget, modest campaign after he earned the Democratic nomination, eventually lost to Gov. Phil Bryant in the general election by 34 points. He told Mississippi Today on Election Day that he planned to vote this time around.</p>

<p>“We do live in the greatest country in the world, and what makes our country great is our government,” Gray told Mississippi Today on Tuesday. “We have everything here that we need and should want to make our lives better. These (Senate candidates) are being honest about how they’re going to take the country. If you don’t get out and vote, it won’t work out for anyone.”</p>

<p>A Sherman-Baria matchup</p>

<p>The runoff presents a quandary for the Democratic electorate: Support Baria, a known quantity who has earned his stripes in the Legislature, or go for the allure of the big money that Sherman and his celebrity wife, Ward, can raise.</p>

<p>Rep. Omeria Scott, D-Laurel, addresses a crowd in Port Gibson on May 9, 2018.</p>

<p>Kayleigh Skinner, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>In some ways, the support of Scott — who has more legislative experience than each of the men who finished in the top slots and dominated much of the Pine Belt counties surrounding Laurel, her hometown — might be vital to the outcome.</p>

<p>“Can you imagine what one woman has just done? I pushed these people to the brink,” she said. “All of the (Democratic) establishment came out and endorsed other people and still we were able to garner 24 percent of the vote.”</p>

<p>Pam Shaw, who worked on Baria’s campaign, said she hopes he can draw Scott’s support because she believes the candidates are aligned on issues.</p>

<p>“In some ways a David Baria-Sherman runoff is what I wanted. There are so many contrasts,” between the candidates, said Shaw, the political director of the Baria campaign.</p>

<p>When asked to elaborate on the contrasts, Shaw said: “One (Baria) lived his whole life living and working in Mississippi. One (Sherman) never lived in Mississippi. One is part of the Democratic establishment. One has never been part of the Democratic establishment.”</p>

<p>Sherman, who maintains that Mississippi has long been the couple’s home, said his first-place finish means that Mississippians are open to a candidate who is not a life-long officeholder.</p>

<p>“Given that you enter a profession running against two people who have been doing it for decades, and you come in with a new person with some new ideas, it’s very affirming of the fact that the state is ready for a real change,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="michaelguestwhithughespoisedtotaketheglovesoffinhousegoprunoff">Michael Guest, Whit Hughes poised to take the gloves off in House GOP runoff</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Ganucheau</p>

<p>Michael Guest and Whit Hughes, the longtime frontrunners for the Republican nomination for the U.S. House seat left vacant by retiring Rep. Gregg Harper, will face each other in a runoff on June 26.</p>

<p>None of the six Republican candidates earned 50 percent of the vote on Tuesday, forcing a runoff in three weeks. Guest, the district attorney for Rankin and Hinds counties, narrowly missed a rare feat: Edging out five other candidates and winning the GOP nomination outright.</p>

<p>Adam Ganucheau, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Michael Guest, who will face Whit Hughes in a runoff June 26, flirted with winning the GOP nomination outright Tuesday night.</p>

<p>“Michael Guest is arguably the most effective and popular local elected official in central Mississippi,” political consultant John Morgan Hughes (no relation to Whit Hughes) said. “You can’t take that away from him. The vote total showed that tonight. He and Whit spent almost the same $400,000 and the costs per vote were wildly different.”</p>

<p>The two candidates raised and spent more money than any of the other four candidates. Guest raised $396,000 and spent $336,000. Hughes, who worked for years in economic development and hospital administration, raised $430,000 and spent $363,000.</p>

<p>Adam Ganucheau, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Whit Hughes’ campaign raised $430,000 and spent $363,000.</p>

<p>Guest benefitted from a rather large base in Rankin and Madison counties, where voters have known him since he was first elected district attorney in 2007. Republican voters in those two counties alone typically make up about 40 percent of the voters in a primary.</p>

<p>“GOP voters in those counties have a history of casting votes for him in previous elections, building up a familiarity with Guest as a candidate,” said Nathan Shrader, co-chair of the political science department at Millsaps College. “He was able to wake up on the morning of the election knowing that he had a rather large pool of voters who had actively supported him in past elections, which isn’t something that most of the other candidates in the race were able to do.”</p>

<p>Guest and Hughes did little to differentiate from each other on policy issues during the campaign. Both talked up the importance of supporting and working with President Donald Trump. Both talked about the importance of small business as well as attracting large corporations to the state through fiscally conservative tax policy. Both expressed a desire to get government spending under control. Both espoused pro-life and Christian values.</p>

<p>The campaign to this point has been generally positive with little mud-slinging on either side. Pundits and operatives had already begun buzzing late Tuesday evening about an expected shift in campaign rhetoric, predicting a nastier tone from both sides as June 26 approaches.</p>

<p>The winner of the Guest-Hughes runoff will face state Rep. Michael Evans, who won the Democratic primary on Tuesday. Evans soundly defeated little-known Michael Aycox, the state’s first openly gay congressional candidate.</p>

<p>Evans, a poultry farmer and firefighter from Preston, will offer voters a more conservative approach, even as a Democrat. He is pro-life and a strong supporter of the Second Amendment.</p>

<p>“My message of being a candidate for Congress who’s a voice of common sense for Mississippians in the (third congressional district) will reach even further in the general election,” Evans wrote on Facebook on Tuesday night.</p>

<h2 id="hackerstargetstatevotingmachinesbutwithnosuccess">Hackers target state voting machines, but with no success</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Bobby Harrison</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-30</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/05/31/hackers-target-state-voting-machines-but-with-no-success/ </p>

<p>JACKSON – Between April 23 and May 23, there were about 3,000 unsuccessful attempts to hack into Mississippi’s elections data system.</p>

<p>But that is not unusual, Secretary of State Debert Hosemann said. Such attempts are ongoing, though, he said hacking efforts increased slightly — by about 1,000 per month — during the 2016 elections.</p>

<p>He said the efforts to access information stored in Mississippi’s statewide Elections Management System come from all over the world.</p>

<p>“They only have to be successful once,” Hosemann said. “I have to be successful 3,000 times per month.”</p>

<p>The efforts to hack into the system, Hosemann said, are most likely to try to obtain personal information, such as the last four digits of the Social Security numbers of Mississippi’s registered voters for possible financial gain, not to alter election results.</p>

<p>The voting machines are not online so it would literally take someone stealing the machine to alter results. The state’s 82 counties are responsible for gathering and counting their own election results.</p>

<p>“Nobody can get into our system except the people who work here,” said Forrest County Circuit Clerk Gwen Wilks, explaining that the system is not online.</p>

<p>The certified results from each of the 82 counties are sent to the Secretary of State’s office within 10 days of the election.</p>

<p>Hosemann said it also would be difficult to hack into the state system and alter voter registration lists. The voter registration information is online because it is constantly changing and being updated.</p>

<p>In the coming months, the counties can apply for a portion of $4.5 million in federal funds to purchase new voting machines or make other updates to their election systems.</p>

<p>The grants will be awarded through the Secretary of State’s office based on the number of registered voters in the county.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State’s office received authority from the Legislature to use $224,000 in existing funds to draw down the federal funds and will use those matching funds, as well as possibly a small amount of federal funds, to update its cybersecurity.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State’s office hopes to award all the grants to the counties this summer.</p>

<h2 id="oliviayplaintiffstobryantreplacecpsheadorgotocourt">Olivia Y plaintiffs to Bryant: Replace CPS head or go to court</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Larrison Campbell</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-30</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/05/31/olivia-y-plaintiffs-to-bryant-replace-cps-head-or-go-to-court/ </p>

<p>The plaintiffs in a long-running lawsuit against Mississippi’s foster care system are taking the state back to court after the governor refused their request to remove the current head of Child Protection Services. Thursday’s announcement is the latest in a five-month stretch of bad news for the beleaguered agency, which spent much of the 2018 legislative session under scrutiny for an unexplained $39 million deficit.</p>

<p>Child Protection Services executive director Jess Dickinson has made progress in past 14 months, said Gov. Phil Bryant.</p>

<p>Citing a “failure of leadership,” attorneys for plaintiffs in the Olivia Y. lawsuit asked a federal judge on Thursday to appoint an outside receiver to run the agency. Marcia Lowry told Mississippi Today that she filed the motion for contempt only after the plaintiffs asked Gov. Phil Bryant to replace current head of Child Protection Services, Jess Dickinson, with new leadership.</p>

<p>Lowry said under Dickinson’s tenure, the agency is even farther from complying with the terms of the settlement in Olivia Y., a 2004 lawsuit responsible for completely dismantling and then rebuilding the state’s foster care agency. Lowry cited the agency’s struggle to staff enough caseworkers as a ongoing issue that “puts Mississippi’s children at risk.”</p>

<p>“Since (Dickinson’s appointment in September) it has been an increasingly discouraging prospect,” Lowry said. “I do not believe the current administration is going to be able to deal with the serious problems they have.”</p>

<p>But in a statement to Mississippi Today, Bryant doubled-down on his support for Dickinson, whom he had appointed only nine months earlier, stating the former Supreme Court Justice was steering the beleaguered agency in the right direction.</p>

<p>“I am pleased with the progress CPS has made, including reducing by 700 the number of children in foster care the last 14 months and nearly doubling the number of adoptions in the current fiscal year. I am confident that progress will continue under current leadership as we vigorously oppose plaintiffs’ latest legal maneuvering,” Bryant said in the statement.</p>

<p>Agency data released last week backs up Bryant’s claims about foster care and adoption. According to Child Protection Services, the number of children in the state foster care system has dropped dramatically since April 2017, going from 6,094 to 5,403 in May 2018. In fiscal year 2017, CPS finalized 302 adoptions. For fiscal year 2018, which ends June 30, the agency has already finalized 574 adoptions.</p>

<p>Larrison Campbell, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>In a news conference on economic development Thursday afternoon, Bryant also said in response to a question about the motion for contempt that “we believe we are in compliance.”</p>

<p>CPS issued a statement Thursday that echoed Bryant’s confidence in Dickinson and the agency’s progress in the two years since the Legislature had voted to set up CPS as a stand-alone agency. Until late 2015, CPS had been a subagency of the Department of Human Services. The change, another requirement of the Olivia Y. settlement, was meant to ensure the agency received proper funding.</p>

<p>“We are confident we are moving in the right direction to ensure the continued protection and safety of at-risk children and their families. We disagree with the plaintiff’s assertions and will continue working diligently each day to care for the thousands of abused and neglected children entrusted into our custody for protection,” Child Protection Services said in its statement.</p>

<p>But the agency is not in compliance with the terms of the Olivia Y. settlement, according to data released earlier this month. The settlement, which the agency agreed to in late 2016, requires CPS to have enough caseworkers on staff to properly handle all of the children currently monitored by the agency.</p>

<p>Data released earlier this month indicates that Child Protection Services is still struggling to maintain minimum staffing requirements. At the end of 2017, only 61 percent of caseworkers had caseloads small enough to comply with the settlement, according to Public Catalyst, the consulting firm hired to monitor the agency. The target for that date had been 90 percent.</p>

<p>As of May 15, the compliance rate was even lower—only 52 percent of caseworkers were overseeing the correct number of cases. This means that by the terms of the settlement, nearly half were working over capacity.</p>

<p>The reason for the drop in compliance is complex. Since the first of the year, CPS has added 22 caseworkers, going from 823 to 845. And while, as Bryant mentioned, the number of children in foster care has declined by 700 over the last year, the total number of cases being monitored by CPS employees has actually increased, surging 1200 from 14,476 to 15,693 in the first four months of 2018.</p>

<p>In an April meeting, Dickinson explained that the agency had been steadily hiring new employees but that the sheer number of children in the state system, particularly on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, made it difficult to meet the settlement’s requirements.</p>

<p>High turnover rates have long been a problem for CPS caseworkers. To stem these losses, in January, the legislature gave the agency the authority to increase the starting salaries for its caseworkers by $4,000, from $26,000 to $30,000 a year. Whether this has helped retention is unclear. The agency did not respond to a request for information on staff turnover Thursday.</p>

<p>But since the start of the year the agency has lost several high profile leaders. Last week, Dickinson announced in a staff memo that Tracey Malone, the Deputy Commissioner of Child Welfare, would retire this summer. Cindy Greer, a deputy commissioner for information technology, resigned earlier this month. And Takesha Darby, the agency’s deputy commissioner of finance, left the agency shortly after the agency’s $39 million deficit announcement.</p>

<p>Tracy Malone, Mississippi Department of Child Protection Services</p>

<p>In addition, for fiscal year 2019, the Legislature funded the agency at the same level as it had the previous year—$110 million. This is a big problem, Dickinson said in April, if the agency is required to bring on even more staff. As a result, Dickinson asked whether the strict requirements of Olivia Y. echo what’s in the best interest of the child, suggesting that the alternative to exceeding caseloads is to leave the children in unsafe homes.</p>

<p>“We are going item by item down this budget, and we’re trying to determine what we have to spend, what can I cut that will least affect the safety our our children,” Dickinson said. “And I am making those decisions irrespective of Olivia Y. requirements? I don’t want to put a child in danger just to avoid criticism in the Olivia Y. litigation.”</p>

<p>But Lowry countered that a child, not properly supervised, is also a child at risk. This is, in effect, the origin of the Olivia Y. litigation. In 2004, six children in foster care sued the state of Mississippi for failing to adequately provide for children in state custody. Olivia Y., a three-year-old, was so severely neglected by her foster family that by the time the state intervened she weighed only 22 pounds. A federal court sided with the plaintiffs, known collectively as Olivia Y., and the resulting settlement has completely remade the agency—and made staffing requirements one of the pillars of this new agency.</p>

<p>Bryant’s decision to appointment Dickinson to the helm of CPS last September was viewed by many at the time as a relatively uncontroversial move. The former state Supreme Court justice seemed a natural replacement for his one-time colleague on the bench, David Chandler, who had received national praise for his work with the agency since taking the reins in late 2015.</p>

<p>But within months, Dickinson proved he wasn’t afraid to ruffle the feathers of even the most powerful lawmakers. In early January, at his first public meeting at the Capitol, Dickinson stunned legislators by announcing his agency was facing a record-breaking $39 million deficit, which he blamed on a “legislative error.”</p>

<p>Many lawmakers took that blame, admitting that, in their rush to comply with the requirements of the Olivia Y. settlement, they didn’t fully vet how spinning Child Protection Services into a separate agency from the Department of Human Services would affect its funding.</p>

<p>“We thought we could do it on our own, and we went out and did it wrong,” said Sen. Terry Burton, R-Newton.</p>

<p>But when asked how the problem would be addressed in that meeting, Dickinson relied heavily on John Davis, executive director of the Department of Human Services, to explain the funding issues. Many lawmakers were quick to question why Dickinson waited three months after joining CPS to notify lawmakers of the deficit, and some questioned whether Dickinson, himself, fully understood how the agency’s funding works.</p>

<p>“These agencies, we depend on them and their experts to tell us what goes in that federal line,” said Senate Appropriations Chair Buck Clarke, R-Hollandale, said in January.</p>

<p>Lowry, too, said she’s frustrated with Dickinson’s answers about his agency’s budget, particularly what caused the nearly $40 million deficit for 2018, but she’s never received a clear explanation.</p>

<p>“We tried to understand what the new commissioner was talking about when he was talking in the paper about what was the deficit,” Lowry said. “We were never able to get to the bottom of that.”</p>

<p>She said she’s asked for information about how the legislature’s decision to not increase funds for 2019 would affect staffing but has not yet received answers.</p>

<p>In April, Dickinson told Mississippi Today that “I have had nobody be able to explain to me how this happened.” His guess, he said, was that the 2018 deficit was caused by the agency leadership’s attempt to get the legislature to “increase spending authority” for the new agency.</p>

<p>“They over-represented expenses, they over-represented revenues, but in an attempt to arrive at a correct bottom line, which they never did,” Dickinson said in April.</p>

<p>As the lawsuit has dragged on for the last 14 years, it’s clear that rebuilding an agency has not been an easy task, for either the state or those taking it to court. In his comments Thursday, Bryant suggested that “the plaintiffs’ attorneys are making a lot of money keeping this case going. They do not want to settle it.”</p>

<p>Lowry, who works for nonprofit A Better Childhood, offered a different take.</p>

<p>“We’re not interested in causing any kind of disruption for the sake of disruption. Basically we have tried everything we can think of and we’re not going to wait. Enough is enough.”</p>

<p>Even after graduating top of his class at Louisiana State University, where he earned a degree in landscape architecture, all Jackson glass artist Andrew Cary “Andy” Young wanted — and all he’s ever wanted — is to be an artist.</p>

<p>“I loved stained glass, so I learned all I could about it, and that’s all I’ve ever done,” he said.</p>

<p>In 1975, Young opened Pearl River Glass Studio, which quickly became the staging ground for his impressive career of creating stained glass windows for churches and public spaces. Creating an independent body of work, though, has been crucial to maintaining the level of professionalism for which Young has become known.</p>

<p>“For example, Walter Anderson worked in his family’s business as a decorator – a functional working artist. But he also spent a good amount of time creating art for himself. That’s the art that made him a well-known artist,” Young said.</p>

<p>“I think it’s like practicing piano. A concert pianist doesn’t just walk out on a stage and miraculously play. He must put in the time practicing. When it’s time for me to design a new window for a church or anything else, that practice helps me to create a design. I have to be ready and inspired when the time comes.”</p>

<p>Andrew Cary Young presenting for “History is Lunch” — A Mississippi Department of Archives and History lecture series</p>

<p>Young is one of two recipients of the Mississippi Institute of Arts &amp; Letters’ (MIAL) lifetime achievement award. MIAL, begun in 1978, supports, nurtures and recognizes Mississippi’s artists, including fiction and nonfiction authors, visual artists, musical composers, photographers and poets. Recipients of this year’s awards, who will be honored at a banquet Saturday at the Two Mississippi Museums, must be current Mississippi residents or have significant ties to the state. Nominations are made by active members of MIAL.</p>

<p>As part of the awards’ weekend activities, Young will host an open house at Pearl River Glass Studios from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. Saturday. The tour coincides with a special exhibit, “Introspective,” a collection of Young’s artwork through the years.</p>

<p>“This show is descriptive of what the MIAL award is all about,” Young said. “Stained glass tells a story. There’s a narrative in each piece. In the South, story and art go hand-in-hand. In Mississippi, we are all about the story. That’s what I’m doing with my church windows.”</p>

<p>William Dunlap, a Mississippi-born artist, writer and arts advocate, attended Young’s presentation on the window he created for the newly opened Mississippi Arts &amp; Entertainment Experience in Meridian.</p>

<p>“I can’t say enough good things about Andy. Unlike many artists who left the state to pursue their work – and I’m in that demographic – Andy stayed in Mississippi and carved out a successful career doing the art that he loves,” Dunlap said.</p>

<p>Robert Ivy</p>

<p>Young shares the Noel Polk Lifetime Achievement Award, named for MIAL co-founder, with Robert Ivy, a Columbus native and executive vice president and chief executive officer of the American Institute of Architects. Ivy is also an accomplished writer, serving as former editor-in-chief of Architectural Record, and author of Fay Jones, Architect, published in 2001 and now in its third printing.</p>

<p>In addition to the lifetime achievement awards, the 39th annual Mississippi Institute for Arts &amp; Letters will present a special achievement award to The Mississippi Encyclopedia, a massive undertaking by editors Ted Ownby and Charles Reagan Wilson. The nine-pound tome features 1,500 essays by 650 authors on all things Mississippi, from academics and agriculture to Zig Ziglar.</p>

<p>The 2018 MIAL category winners are:</p>

<p>Michael Knight</p>

<p>Michael Knight, fiction — Knight, who received his master’s of arts at the University of Southern Mississippi, is the author of novels The Typist and Divining Rod, and a series of short stories and novellas.

His newest collection of stories, Eveningland (Atlantic Monthly Press) was released in March 2017. Knight lives in Knoxville, Tenn., with his family and teaches creative writing at the University of Tennessee.</p>

<p>John T. Edge, nonfiction — In addition to being director of the Southern Foodways Alliance, Edge is a James Beard Award winner. Edge, author of Potlikker Papers: A Food History of the Modern South, has long understood how the South, its stories and its food are all intertwined, and his work celebrates that in a way that helps Southerners feel proud of their heritage and others to understand and appreciate it.</p>

<h2 id="davidbariaunderstandsthelongoddshefacesinussenaterace">David Baria understands the long odds he faces in U.S. Senate race</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Bobby Harrison</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-29</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/05/30/david-baria-understands-the-long-odds-he-faces-in-u-s-senate-race/ </p>

<p>In this March 10, 2015 file photograph, Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, speaks at the well in House chambers at the Capitol in Jackson, Miss.</p>

<p>Rogelio V. Solis / AP / File</p>

<p>David Baria describes himself as practical – no Don Quixote tilting at windmills.</p>

<p>The Bay St. Louis Democrat concedes he faces long odds against incumbent U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Tupelo Republican, in the November general election. And before the general election, there is the uncertainty and potential landmines of Tuesday’s party primary election where Baria faces entrepreneur and venture capitalist Howard Sherman, husband of accomplished actress Sela Ward of Meridian, and fellow state House member Omeria Scott of Laurel and three lesser-known candidates.</p>

<p>“I know this is not an easy undertaking,” Baria said recently in his Jackson law office after a day of campaigning.</p>

<p>But Baria points out overcoming long odds is what he must do almost daily in his profession as a trial attorney – a job he claims with pride. The same is true, he says, of being a politician where he first defeated an entrenched incumbent to win a seat in the state Senate before he opted to run for House District 122 viewed by many as a district that was quickly trending Republican. Baria has won the seat twice despite direct efforts by Gov. Phil Bryant and other members of the state Republican establishment to defeat him.</p>

<p>Those odds, though, are nothing compared to what he and his family have faced in their personal lives. And overcoming those odds inflicted much more of a cost than losing an election.</p>

<p>In 2005, the Barias lost their oldest son, Darden, to rabies. It was the only death from rabies in the nation that year and the first death from rabies in Mississippi since 1947.</p>

<p>To this day, it is not clear how the child contracted rabies, though, it is believed he was bitten in his sleep by a bat. The child never reported being bitten.</p>

<p>When asked about the incident, Baria agrees to provide details, but apologizes saying he cannot do so without “getting a lump in my throat.”</p>

<p>The child’s death at age 10 occurred 30 days after the Barias, like many other Gulf Coast residents, “lost everything” in Hurricane Katrina.</p>

<p>The Barias had moved to Bay St. Louis about 15 months before the storm from Jackson, though, David Baria was no stranger to the Mississippi Gulf Coast. He grew up on the eastern side of the Gulf in Jackson County where his father was a computer programmer and his mother worked primarily as a secretary.</p>

<p>After those tragic events of 2005, Baria shut down his law practice and opened with partners a company that first helped with cleanup on the Coast and later operated as a demolition company. Baria said the company served two purposes – to provide a needed service after the devastation from Katrina and to provide him an outlet and job at a time he said he was mentally unprepared to practice law.</p>

<p>“I just wanted to be outside,” he said. Two years later, Baria, opted to run and win a seat in the state Senate, beginning his political career focusing on insurance reform he said was needed to help Coast residents.</p>

<p>Baria sold his interest in the demolition company but does have interests in multiple businesses, such as a company that would help large employers track their employees in case of a disaster in their plant. He said none of those investments have made money.</p>

<p>Baria currently serves as the House minority leader. He says he believes there is a path to victory against the incumbent Wicker in the November general election, though, most political observers view the post as a safe Republican post.</p>

<p>“It is time for a change in Mississippi,” Baria said during a recent internet townhall. “For 30 years we have sent the same people to Washington and got the same results. We are still 50th.</p>

<p>“We can no longer tolerate the us vs. them politics that have dominated politics in Mississippi.”</p>

<p>Kayleigh Skinner, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>House Democratic Leader, Rep. David Baria, left, and Senate Democratic Leader Sen. Bill Stone</p>

<p>Baria said he wants to work on issues that he says will unite the state and will move it ahead economically. He makes no bones, though, about his allegiance to the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>“He is a gentleman,” said Speaker Pro Tem Greg Snowden, R-Meridian. “He says what he believes, and I don’t normally agree with that. But is always cordial.”</p>

<p>When a townhall questioner asks for a commitment that he will not switch parties if elected, he said, “I am a 55-year-old man. I am who I am, and I am not going to switch parties.”</p>

<p>During the course of the event he voices support for increasing the minimum wage, protecting the environment and expanding Medicaid to cover primarily the working poor.</p>

<p>Describing himself as a gun owner and hunter, Baria tells a questioner, “I support the Second Amendment, and I support all other nine amendments in the Bill of Rights.”</p>

<p>Baria also makes no attempt to hide his distaste of President Donald Trump and cites Wicker’s enthusiastic support of the president as another reason he entered the race.</p>

<p>Baria, using unusually colorful language for him, says: “One of the main reasons we need to get rid of our current senator is because he has tried to get so close to our president that he wants to get into his underwear. This is a president who is a salesman and a huckster. And it obvious the president lies. He lies about big things and little things…I am going to be a hedge against the president.”</p>

<p>To do that, Baria must get through the Democratic primary where in recent elections unusual results have occurred – such as little known trucker Robert Gray winning the 2015 Democratic gubernatorial nomination. Then Baria must pull off what would be the biggest political upset in recent Mississippi history by defeating Wicker in the November general election.</p>

<p>R.L. Nave, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Rep. David Baria, flanked by his family, announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in Bay St. Louis.</p>

<p>Baria said his campaign financing will fall far short of what Wicker will bring to the race. The latest campaign reports show Wicker with $3.4 million in cash on hand. Baria said the next campaign finance report will show he has raised about $300,000.</p>

<p>“I have raised sufficient money to run a legitimate campaign,” he said.</p>

<p>As Baria runs that campaign, his wife, the former Marcie Fyke of Jackson, also an attorney but no longer practicing, is under consideration for the seminary to study to become a priest in the Episcopal Church. Their oldest daughter, Merritt, has graduated from Loyola and is considering graduate school while their youngest daughter, Bess, is a student at Loyola. Their son, Max, is in elementary school at home in Bay St. Louis.</p>

<p>If Baria were to pull off that upset and his wife enters the seminary, the family could face some dramatic changes in the coming months.</p>

<p>But based on past experience, the odds are they can cope with those changes.</p>

<h2 id="bridgecrisisstatewideclosurescouldverywelldoubleby2019">Bridge crisis: Statewide closures ‘could very well double’ by 2019</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Ganucheau</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-05-24</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/05/25/bridge-crisis-statewide-closures-could-very-well-double-by-2019/ </p>

<p>Amite County bridge closed by the state.</p>

<p>R.L. Nave, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>The bridge crisis in Mississippi could worsen as more than half the timber bridges across the state have still yet to be inspected under federal guidelines.</p>

<p>In 2016, the Federal Highway Administration forced an extensive round of bridge inspections in Mississippi after concluding the state’s timber bridges had not been properly inspected by county officials. The federal agency then ordered the re-inspection of the bridges over the course of 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p>That federally mandated re-inspection has led to the majority of the closures over the past year. The most recent data from the Office of State Aid Road Construction shows that 526 locally owned bridges are closed around the state, and a vast majority of those are timber bridges that have been closed over the past year.</p>

<p>In the current fiscal year, consultants inspected approximately 1,533 bridges with timber substructures, according to figures provided by Office of State Aid Road Construction. The consultants recommended closing 409 of those bridges, or 29 percent of those already inspected.</p>

<p>But the consultants still have to inspect more than half of the state’s entire inventory of locally-owned timber structures. Between October 2018 and February 2019, the consultants will inspect another approximately 1,650 timber bridges under the federal mandate.</p>

<p>“By this time next year, that closed number could very well have doubled or more,” Derrick Surrette, executive director of the Mississippi Association of Supervisors, told Mississippi Today in an interview earlier this month. “It’s not getting any better.”</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant in April issued an unprecedented emergency declaration, forcing nearly 100 bridges across the state to close to meet the federal mandate.</p>

<p>Many of city and county level officials across the state are searching their own budgets for extra funds to repair and reopen the closed bridges. In many cases, those funds don’t exist. Some are mulling whether to borrow money or raise taxes at the local level.</p>

<p>Legislative leaders, meanwhile, are considering sending additional state funds to local governments. But that very notion has been at the center of intense debate the past few weeks.</p>

<p>Hundreds of the state’s timber-pile bridges such as this one in Amite County were deemed by federal inspection mandates to be unsafe for travel after being improperly inspected for years.</p>

<p>At the end of the 2018 legislative session – before most of the current bridge closings –House Speaker Philip Gunn and Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves publicly sparred over how much state money the Legislature should share with local governments for the bridges that the local governments own.</p>

<p>Gunn has been in favor of sending local governments additional funding with no strings attached, while Reeves has wanted cities and counties to match any state dollars they receive with newly spent dollars of their own.</p>

<p>“There is a real concern among senators whose areas spent state and local tax dollars efficiently repairing bridges and did not wind up on the closure list,” said Laura Hipp, spokeswoman for Reeves, signaling Reeves’ apprehension to share state money.</p>

<p>Since the session ended, Gunn has called for a tax swap that involves phasing out the 4 percent income tax bracket over four years, which generates about $160 million in revenue, and increasing the fuel tax 2 cents each year for four years. At the end of the phase in period, the current gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon would increase 8 cents.</p>

<p>Reeves, on the other hand, has vehemently opposed efforts to raise the gas tax.</p>

<p>Some supervisors in poorer, less populated counties across the state are banking for now on state or federal funding.</p>

<p>Washington County Supervisor Jesse Amos, who also owns a trucking company, said county officials don’t know how they’ll find money to repair all the closed bridges and continue maintaining the aging ones.</p>

<p>“Right now, we’re talking about what we can do – selling some bonds or raising taxes or whatever,” said Amos. “To be honest with you, we’re going to have to wait and hope the Legislature or the feds can come up with some money. Otherwise, we can’t keep up.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, supervisors in five Mississippi counties have told Mississippi Today in recent weeks that many of their bridges, though ordered closed by the outside consultants, are indeed safe.</p>

<p>“The county engineer has put his stamp of approval that the bridge could stay open, and you’ve got another engineer that says close it,” Surrette said. “They’ve got the same type of degree and background and professional experience. I don’t know who’s right and wrong. But I know one thing: You’ve got engineers saying different things.”</p>

<p>Officials in Smith and Jasper counties took the matter into their own hands, filing a lawsuit against Gov. Bryant in early May, claiming the governor’s proclamation exceeds the powers he is granted under the emergency management law. The state departments of Transportation and Public Safety and Mississippi Emergency Management Agency are also named as defendants.</p>

<p>In response, the governor cast blame on the county supervisors for not properly maintaining the bridges in the first place and said he is just following the recommendations of the independent inspection consultants who are helping the state comply with the federal mandate.</p>

<p>“I refuse to sit idly by and risk loss of life,” Bryant said in a statement. “Had counties done their job, I would not have had to exercise my authority, which will protect the very people who elected these supervisors.”</p>

<p>Mississippi Prison Industries Corporation is losing money and its future viability as a program is now in question, according to a report from the Joint Legislative Committee on Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review.</p>

<p>The legislative watchdog group’s report, released Monday, cites financial statements for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, when the program saw a decline of $6.7 million in net worth.</p>

<p>“The time has come for MPIC and the Legislature to consider seriously whether the state’s prison industries program has a future and, if so, what changes can be made operationally and legislatively to ensure that the program has a positive outcome,” the report said.</p>

<p>Mississippi Prison Industries is a nonprofit volunteer program aimed at providing work experience for incarcerated adults in Mississippi’s correctional facilities. The corporation solely operates on sales from inmate-made goods, such as furniture, apparel, metal fabrication, printing and other products, according to its website. Many states and the federal Bureau of Prisons have created similar agencies, which they believe can help rehabilitate incarcerated.</p>

<p>The primary goal of the program, as the report states, is to provide inmates with useful activities that can lead to meaningful employment in order to reduce recidivism. Yet, due to a lack of records and data maintenance, the review said it is impossible to accurately assess the program’s impact on recidivism.</p>

<p>The PEER report describes several key components of reducing recidivism that the program is missing, such as providing employment services after an inmate’s release from prison, providing certified technical skills training, and employing the inmates in industries with job prospects.</p>

<p>The committee addressed the issue of financial sustainability in two previous reports since the Mississippi Prison Industries Act of 1990, the committee stated.</p>

<p>“It is disconcerting to note that many of the same major operational deficiencies identified in the first review, conducted 24 years ago, and the second review conducted in 2013, persist in the Committee’s current review of the Mississippi Prison Industries Corporation,” the report said.</p>

<p>The report’s suggestions for moving forward include eliminating its least profitable entities, seeking protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to protect it from creditors, or, if the Board of Directors see little hope in the corporation’s future, dissolving the program altogether.</p>

<p>The review adds that the Legislature could amend laws to transfer the program to the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Of the 49 states that have such programs, only Mississippi and Florida have versions in the form of non-profit corporations.</p>

<p>“The Mississippi Department of Corrections is working closely with MPIC to determine the best course of action going forward,” MDOC Commissioner Pelicia E. Hall said. “The department’s primary goal is to provide offenders with the best chance for successful re-entry.”</p>

<p>MPIC interim CEO Jeff Solari said the Board of Directors will meet in June to discuss the report.</p>

<p>“The MPIC Board and Leadership team takes this matter very seriously and the PEER booklets will be sent to each MPIC Board member for their thorough review,” Solari said in an e-mail. “Our next board meeting is in June and at that time the Board and the Leadership team will have the opportunity to discuss the PEER Committee’s analysis, conclusion and recommendations.</p>

<p>“The Board and Leadership team will continue to monitor operations and business objectives. Any and all questions for comments regarding the MPIC Report will only be determined by the board after the meeting.”</p>

<h2 id="braindraineventlooksbeyonddataexploreswhymississippiansleave">‘Brain drain’ event looks beyond data, explores why Mississippians leave</h2>

<p>Kelsey Davis, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>University of Mississippi student Savannah Smith, far left, interviews panelists at the Overby Center on campus.</p>

<p>OXFORD — In four years, from 2011 to 2015, Mississippi lost $1.5 billion in total income through outmigration of its residents.</p>

<p>In the six years from 2010 to 2016, the state lost 35,013 people — about the population of Tupelo. Mississippi is the only state in the nation that’s losing this many people at this fast of a rate.</p>

<p>Though these statistics — commonly referred to as Mississippi’s “Brain Drain” — have been brought more fully into the public arena by Rethink Mississippi’s Jake McGraw, less talked about is the qualitative motivations behind them.</p>

<p>“Brain drain and migration is something that is not just a quantitative question. It’s one that gets at the very heart of choices we make as human beings,” McGraw said at a public discussion on the topic.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening at the Overby Center for Southern Journalism and Politics at the University of Mississippi, senior honors student Savannah Smith joined McGraw and six student panelists to discuss her thesis, which delves into why Mississippians are leaving the state. </p>

<p>Smith, from Corinth, noted that she always has considered leaving the state, which in part led to her research.</p>

<p>Savannah Smith</p>

<p>“I think it’s something that is far larger than an economic issue in the state. I think it’s very easy to point at jobs and say this is why we don’t have jobs here, but I think it’s much more of a domino effect and I think that goes back to the policies that we make in our Legislature that goes back to the social culture that we have in the state. I think that’s what I really tried to find in my research,” Smith said.</p>

<p>Tuesday evening, she interviewed the six panelists, all Mississippians in their early 20s, asking if they plan to stay in the state, their reasons for staying or leaving, and possible solutions for closing the pipeline of talent that takes people from this state to others.</p>

<p>Two of the six said they plan to stay after graduating from college.</p>

<p>“I tried really hard to stay in state of Mississippi,” said Brady Ruffin, a panelist from Clinton who is moving to Little Rock to pursue a master’s degree. “I really looked at things to do, jobs to apply for. After looking through my options I realized there aren’t that many. … I’m not going too far, but I am leaving the state, and I think it’s a result of a lack of opportunities.”</p>

<p>Another panelist said part of the reason he’s leaving is a sense of close-mindedness that her perceives permeates Mississippi.</p>

<p>“When we try to move forward and try to be progressive and not regressive, there’s a lot of backlash,” said Terrence Johnson, a native Mississippian. “I wanted to be in a place that welcomes dialogue.”</p>

<p>Those who are staying said they feel a sense of duty.</p>

<p>“I don’t necessarily think that’s a good argument for staying or that people should feel indebted to stay here,” said Alexis Smith from Picayune, who will enter into Mississippi Teacher Corps after graduating college.</p>

<p>While the brain drain has been documented through data from the U.S. Census, the IRS and other government agencies, some state leaders deny the phenomenon. Most notably, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves has stated that he believes the data to be exaggerated.</p>

<p>“It’s a bit discouraging (when state leaders deny the data) because I’ve talked to so many of my peers who are leaving and that I know want to have the opportunities that Mississippi doesn’t offer,” Smith said. “I’ve seen the quantitative and the qualitative data surrounding that. … I hope that we’ll be on the same page about it being a problem moving forward.”</p>

<h2 id="firstcybersecuritysummitkeepshackersandterroristsatbay">First Cybersecurity Summit keeps hackers and terrorists at bay</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Kendra Ablaza</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-09</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/04/10/first-cybersecurity-summit-keeps-hackers-and-terrorists-at-bay/ </p>

<p>Cybersecurity may bring to mind threats on a national scale, such as the 143 million American consumers whose personal information was exposed as a result of a data breach at credit reporting agency Equifax.</p>

<p>There are also cyber risks that can occur much closer to home, security experts in Mississippi say, and consumers often do not know how to address those issues.</p>

<p>“I think everybody pretty much thinks that it’s somebody else’s responsibility,” said Melissa Wiggins, a Mississippi College computer science professor.</p>

<p>The 2018 Mississippi College Cybersecurity Summit, Tuesday night through Wednesday, will bring a user-friendly approach to understanding cybersecurity threats and issues to businesses, government and the everyday consumer. The event will cover topics such as anti-terrorism strategies, risk management for small businesses, banking industry regulations, policy and protection and cybersecurity from a state government perspective.</p>

<p>The summit begins with a panel discussion Tuesday night that will address cybersecurity issues that could put the average person at risk of an attack. Wiggins said panelists will discuss how terrorist organizations and radical groups use online tools such as social media and video games to recruit its members.</p>

<p>Speakers will include Maeghin Alarid, a lead policy analyst with Toeroek Associates of Colorado Springs, Colorado. She was a terrorism instructor at the Defense Nuclear Weapons School and is a published researcher.</p>

<p>Up to 300 people are expected to attend the summit. Wiggins, one of the main organizers of the summit, said many data breaches occur because consumers or small businesses are not paying attention to security or do not have a lot of the background necessary to do that.</p>

<p>Mississippi College</p>

<p>Melissa C. Wiggins, professor of engineering, computer science and physics, Mississippi College</p>

<p>“We want people to understand it can be a complex, but also a simple, thing to make sure we keep ourselves, our identities and our financial information secured,” Wiggins said. “We would like businesses and industries to see there are a lot of things they might not have necessarily thought about. This is a relatively new area.”</p>

<p>Wiggins said this is the first conference of its kind in Mississippi to educate the public in a consumer-friendly way on personal cybersecurity risks, as well as national threats such as cybersecurity warfare. She was inspired to coordinate this summit at Mississippi College after attending Montreat College’s RETR3AT Cybersecurity Conference in North Carolina.</p>

<p>The summit will provide cybersecurity tools and resources as it relates to a variety of industries and topics, such as infrastructure, health care, government, education, business and cryptocurrency, Wiggins said.</p>

<p>“People use social media, use email and do internet banking on their phones and having a secure device to do those things on is very important,” Wiggins said. “An insecure device could let a hacker come in and steal their money.”</p>

<p>The event also coincides with the recent launch of Mississippi College’s graduate and certificate program in cybersecurity studies, which Wiggins said is a booming field nationwide. Wiggins said the event will also focus on making the public aware of the jobs available in this new industry.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity has been a growing concern in Mississippi. Last fall, ProPublica reported that names, addresses, birthdates and the last four digits of social security numbers shared by the Mississippi Secretary of State’s office with a voter registration clearinghouse is susceptible to hackers.</p>

<p>Joe Stradinger, CEO and founder of content and media company EdgeTheory, will moderate one of the panels at the event focusing on “Bitcoin, Blockchain &amp; Cryptocurrency”. He said many small- and medium-sized businesses could go out of business within six months of a cyber attack.</p>

<p>“There are very few things in life that can really destroy you,” Stradinger said.</p>

<p>“As consumers, it affects every aspect of our lives – our kids, personally and in business.”</p>

<h2 id="newtrailwilltrackmississippisliteraryhistory">New trail will track Mississippi’s literary history</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Mississippi Today</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-04-03</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/04/04/new-trail-will-track-mississippis-literary-history/ </p>

<p>The first markers on the new Mississippi Writers Trail will be be unveiled in August during the 2018 Mississippi Book Festival.</p>

<p>Similar to the Mississippi music trails, the Writers Trail will be a compilation of historical markers honoring acclaimed and influential writers throughout the state, including William Faulkner, Jesmyn Ward, Richard Wright, Eudora Welty, Margaret Walker Alexander, Richard Ford and more.</p>

<p>“Based on the nationwide success of efforts in Mississippi to tell the story of our state’s cultural heritage and music with markers such as the Blues Trail and Country Music Trail, we believe that the excitement and momentum to mark the cultural significance of Mississippi’s rich literary history through the construction of a new statewide Writers Trail is ready to begin,” said Malcolm White, executive director of the Mississippi Arts Commission.</p>

<p>”Further, we believe that the creation of the Mississippi Writers Trail will help to promote economic development, tourism and civic pride within our state,” White said.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Arts Commission, in partnership with the Community Foundation for Mississippi, Mississippi Humanities Council, Mississippi Book Festival, Mississippi Development Authority, Mississippi Department of Archives and History and the Mississippi Library Commission, announced the Writers Trail on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The National Endowment for the Humanities recently announced a special grant program for state history and heritage projects that commemorate the 150th and 200th anniversaries of statehood and has awarded its first Statehood Grant of $30,000 to support the creation of a Mississippi Writers Trail.</p>

<h2 id="thekkkresurfacesthistimewithpoliticalintentions">The KKK resurfaces, this time with political intentions</h2>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/04/04/the-kkk-resurfaces-this-time-with-political-intentions/ </p>

<p>The Ku Klux Klan is getting back into Mississippi electoral politics.</p>

<p>Last week, the United Dixie White Knights, a south Mississippi-based chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, allegedly sent video of a burning cross to the leader of Mississippi Rising Coalition, a Gulf Coast-based group working to change the state flag, which is the last in the nation containing the Confederate battle emblem.</p>

<p>Following the backlash, which included national media attention, the group denied sending the video and posted a statement disparaging the coalition and criticizing reporters who covered the story, and included a political threat to a top legislative Republican, who has said he wants a new flag.</p>

<p>“Phillip (sic) Gunn is high upon our list of turncoats who chose to stab Mississippi voters in the back because he lusts for National politics. He will soon regret this decision. Our Jackson, Ms Klavern is one of the largest Ku Klux Klaverns in this country and I have given them orders to blanket Gunns district with fliers meant to awaken the White sheep to his actions,” states the unsigned post, referring to the Mississippi House speaker, a Republican from Clinton.</p>

<p>Mississippi Rising Coalition Facebook page</p>

<p>On Wednesday, just days after receiving the video, the Mississippi Rising Coalition filed a federal lawsuit to force the city of Ocean Springs to stop flying the state flag.</p>

<p>Plaintiffs in the lawsuit claim the city is violating the federal Fair Housing Act by flying the state flag and expressing “a preference for white residents and a corresponding discouragement, and suppression, of African-American residents.”</p>

<p>The KKK chapter’s alleged threat was included in the lawsuit.</p>

<p>“(The Ocean Springs mayor and board of aldermen) have emboldened extremists to act out their true white supremacist feelings,” a plaintiff in the suit and Jackson County NAACP President Curley Clark said on Wednesday. “We are here to see if we can find some equality for all of Ocean Springs’ citizens.”</p>

<p>Responding to reports of the video, the KKK chapter’s leader, Brent Waller, vowed increased political action to keep the state flag flying in an official capacity.</p>

<p>“If we don’t start getting in politics, they’ll (activists who want to change the flag) just run the narrative,” Brent Waller, the KKK group’s leader, told Mississippi Today in a telephone interview on Monday. “They try to censor us to keep us and the far right from being heard. We’re living in a state of tyranny today. That’s the way I see it. It just makes us sick.”</p>

<p>Brent Waller, spokesman for the United Dixie White Knights in Mississippi in a 2016 photograph.</p>

<p>During the interview, he again called out Gunn, who is the most prominent Republican leader in the state to call for a new state flag. Gunn’s office declined to comment.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do everything in my power to throw that bastard out on his head,” Waller said of Gunn.</p>

<p>When asked what, specifically, Waller planned, he said: “I know that trick. I can’t give out my strategy. Then they’ll be ready for it.”</p>

<p>Less than three minutes later, Waller laid out that political strategy.</p>

<p>“We’re going to blast his district with flyers,” Waller said. “Maybe we’ll work on his campaign and get inside info. If he rears his head and pops up much more, I’m just going to endorse him — see how he’ll like that.”</p>

<p>When asked if he thought his endorsement would hurt Gunn, Waller replied: “I know it will.” When asked why, he said, “Because they’ll associate him with us. No one ever wants that. We’ve had success with that in the past.”</p>

<p>When asked about which campaign that strategy worked, Waller pointed to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.</p>

<p>“Some brothers in Alabama endorsed Hillary,” Waller said. “Ain’t none of them boys supported her, but the press sure enough ran with it.”</p>

<p>Local and national news outlets did cover that 2016 endorsement, but nearly every report expressed skepticism that the endorsement was genuine or carried any weight.</p>

<p>The KKK was formed after the Civil War to terrorize blacks and to enforce Jim Crow segregation laws. Its members, typically operating in secrecy have included law enforcement officers, local and state politicians and, in Mississippi, at least one U.S. senator, Theodore Bilbo. In addition to enforcing black codes, Klan members also historically used racial terror to keep African Americans from voting.</p>

<p>This July 8, 2017 photo shows members of the Ku Klux Klan in Charlottesville, Va., carrying a banner that resembles the Mississippi state flag. Events in Charlottesville touched off a new round of debate over public displays of Confederate symbols.</p>

<p>Recent years have seen a spate of Klan rallies and other activity in support of the Confederate battle flag, which came under renewed scrutiny after the murders of nine churchgoers by a white neo-Confederate named Dylann Roof in 2015, and against the removal of Confederate statues around the country.</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center’s estimates that in 2017 the United Dixie White Knights had at least five flyer campaigns in Mississippi and Alabama. In 2016, the group distributed flyers in a black neighborhood in Florence and in the Jackson neighborhood of Belhaven.</p>

<p>Heidi Beirich, director of SPLC’s Intelligence Project, which covers hate groups and their activities, does not believe the group is growing, however. Waller would not say this week how many members are in his group.</p>

<p>“Even though it’s nearly impossible to know membership numbers for any group, the claim that they’re one the largest KKK groups in America is a far from true,” Beirich said. “In the months leading up to former imperial wizard, Brent Waller, closing the doors to UDWK in July 2017, it was clear that it was struggling for members and was trying to form alliances with other Klan groups and hate groups in an effort to stay afloat. While we’ve seen some activity from UDWK in 2018, we don’t believe that the group is gaining significant numbers.”</p>

<p>Kayleigh Skinner, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>NBC News Chairman Andy Lack, left, reporter/contributor to PBS NewsHour and MSNBC Yamiche Alcindor, special correspondent for NBC News Tom Brokaw, and Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba speak at the screening of “Hope and Fury” at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In his debut hit, about surviving a bad car crash, Kanye West rapped that upon learning of his broken jaw his girlfriend would be “scared as hell that her guy looked like Emmett Till,” referring to the 14-year-old boy whom white men beat and killed in Mississippi in 1955 for flirting with one of their wives.</p>

<p>Till’s death — and, more specifically, the photos from Till’s funeral that appeared in Jet magazine — is credited with breathing life to the modern civil rights movement.</p>

<p>But Yamiche Alcindor, a journalist of Haitian descent, says she and her mother, who holds two doctoral degrees, were unfamiliar with the Till story until she heard Kanye’s song and Googled the teenager’s name.</p>

<p>“When you realize that you can come to this country, you can have your child in AP U.S. History and not know the name Emmett Till, it tells you where we are as a society,” said Alcindor, who covers the White House for PBS NewsHour and contributes to MSNBC, responding to a question about racial progress in the 50 years since the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis.</p>

<p>The role of the news media in King’s social movements is the focus of Hope &amp; Fury: MLK, the Movement and the Media, a documentary timed for release as the nation remembers King’s assassination 50 years ago Wednesday. Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News and a Mississippi Today co-founder, was executive producer and provided an editor’s cut of the film for a screening hosted by Mississippi Today at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum Tuesday night. Alcindor joined Tom Brokaw, a veteran broadcaster who covered the civil rights movement during the 1960s, and Jackson Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba in a panel discussion following the screening.</p>

<p>The film begins with dashboard camera footage from the 2016 shooting of Philando Castile near St. Paul, Minn., by a police officer. From there, it jumps to the scene from inside the car as Castile bled to death, captured on Facebook live by his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds.</p>

<p>Interviewed in Hope &amp; Fury, Nikole Hannah-Jones, a New York Times Magazine writer, and Joy Reid of MSNBC likened the live-streaming of Castile’s killing with the decision Till’s mother made to live stream her son’s death in a way by having an open-casket funeral and allowing a magazine to publish photos of his violently mangled face.</p>

<p>“The country is going to have to confront this. I’m not going to suffer this by myself. If this is what you’re going to do to black boys, you’re going to have to deal with,” Reid said of Mamie Till-Mobley’s decision.</p>

<p>Kayleigh Skinner, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. demonstrated his understanding of mass media’s power, and television news in particular, by instructing protesters to dress in their Sunday best and holding demonstrations early enough in the day so that the footage could be transported to New York in time to appear on nightly network news broadcasts. Television is also how America witnessed the splintering of the civil rights movement and the rise of the younger, more radical Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and its fiery leader, Stokely Carmichael, who popularized the “Black Power” rallying cry.</p>

<p>The media continued to play a vital role in the spread of civil rights movements by covering events such as the King and Carmichael-led March Against Fear from Memphis to Jackson, “Bloody Sunday” in Selma, Ala., riots that followed King’s assassination, to the police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles and protests in Ferguson, Mo., after a white police officer killed 18-year-old Michael Brown.</p>

<p>Kayleigh Skinner, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Alcindor argued that the Ferguson protests, which she covered for USA Today, might not have become a national story had a gas station not been burned. The media is attracted to moments of crisis, she said. Activists in Ferguson also made wide use of social media because they believed the mainstream media focused too much on property damage and ignored the story of police brutality in the St. Louis suburb.</p>

<p>“When we see images that remind us of Emmett Till, when we see the stories of young people being gunned down we have to confront not only the image that we see of ourselves and the perception we have of one another, but also how the media supports getting the story out and how the media supports the confusion that exists,” said Lumumba, who participated in demonstrations in Ferguson and practiced civil rights law before becoming Jackson’s mayor.</p>

<p>Kayleigh Skinner, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Brokaw said the racially mixed audience at the Hope &amp; Fury screening Tuesday is testament to some progress on the race relations front, but he also thought America would be farther along by now.</p>

<p>“When I think back now what it was like not just in the South but across this country from 1965 to now, we’ve certainly not made the progress I expected. Maybe I was a Kumbaya white boy who thought we’ve arrived at the Promised Land,” he said. “I thought we would be so much farther at this point for all the grief, the violence, the deaths, the sacrifices that were made.”</p>

<p>Several audience members expressed similar mixed emotions — they were moved by people coming together to see the film but remained disturbed by the some of the images in the movie.</p>

<p>Asked what he took away, 12-year-old Ibrahim Hudson, said: “Black people were misunderstood and they were punished for it. They weren’t embraced for standing up to white people. … It makes me feel mad and proud at the same time.”</p>

<p>Sybil Child said, “It was absolutely wonderful to see all these people here together.” But she added, “I tell you, the film just about made me sick. I felt like I needed to go to every black person in the audience and say, ‘I am sorry.’ I mean I have to apologize for every white person in here. It was very very moving.”</p>

<h2 id="felonvotingbandrawsanotherfederallawsuit">Felon voting ban draws another federal lawsuit</h2>

<p id="byline">by: R.L. Nave</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/03/27/felon-voting-ban-draws-another-federal-lawsuit/ </p>

<p>R.L. Nave, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit in federal court over the state’s voter disenfrachisement laws. From left: Attorneys Jonathan Youngwood and Jody Owens with plaintiffs Dennis Hopkins, Walter Kuhn and Byron Coleman in Jackson.</p>

<p>For the second time in less than six months, the state of Mississippi is being sued in federal court for the way that it takes away and restores voting rights to people convicted of certain felonies.</p>

<p>Five men are challenging the constitutionality of Mississippi’s disenfranchisement laws, which govern how people can regain their voting rights after being convicted of disqualifying crimes.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Constitution outlines several crimes for which a conviction would disqualify a person from voting, including bribery, theft, arson, obtaining money or goods under false pretenses, perjury, forgery and embezzlement. Murder and rape were added in 1968 while many other felonies, including drug crimes, are not disqualifying.</p>

<p>Only a gubernatorial pardon or act of the Legislature can restore the voting rights of a person convicted of a disqualifying crime. Attorneys for the Mississippi Southern Poverty Law Center and New York City-based firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP say Mississippi essentially imposes a lifetime voting ban, which violates several provisions of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>“Our clients are citizens who made a mistake, paid their debt to society long ago, and now live and work alongside us, pay taxes, worship with us, fight in our wars, send their children to school with ours, and are equal members of our society in every way, save one — they have no say in our representation in Mississippi and in Washington,” said Jody Owens, the managing attorney for the Mississippi SPLC, at a news conference.</p>

<p>Delbert Hosemann</p>

<p>Delbert Hosemann, the Mississippi Secretary of State, whose agency oversees elections, is the named defendant in the suit. His office, citing the pending litigation, declined to comment.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was announced outside a Secretary of State office building named for Heber Ladner, Mississippi’s longest serving elections chief who was frequently named as a defendant in voting rights lawsuits of the 1960s. Ladner later administered the oath of office to Rep. Robert G. Clark, the first African American elected to the Legislature after Reconstruction.</p>

<p>The legal action Tuesday follows a similar federal challenge filed in September 2017, which argues that Mississippi’s voter disenfranchisement law was designed to ensnare African Americans, whom the framers of the state constitution believed were more prone to committing certain kinds of crimes.</p>

<p>A recent Mississippi Today analysis — looking at conviction records from the Administrative Office of Courts that span from 1994 until last November — shows that 56,255 Mississippians have lost the right to vote in that time due to felony charges. Of that total, 61 percent are African-American, who represent just 36 percent of the state’s total voting-age population.</p>

<p>Mississippi Today’s data analysis also shows that the top disqualifying crimes for disenfranchisement are property crimes, not violent offenses. Murder and rape together account for only 6 percent of all disqualifying crimes.</p>

<p>The lawsuit filed Tuesday also claims that disenfranchisement is tantamount to a violation of First Amendment protections of political speech.</p>

<p>Jon O’Neal, one of the plaintiffs, said he was very involved in conservative politics in Jones County before his conviction for second-degree arson of a non-dwelling in 2015.</p>

<p>“Politics was a big part of my life and now it’s just gone. I was very political and now I’m nothing,” O’Neal, 37, stated in the complaint.</p>

<p>Dennis Hopkins, who was convicted of grand larceny in 1998 but since has become involved in his community, including teaching youth sports, said that if he is expected to pay taxes in his life after prison, he should likewise be given back his right to vote.</p>

<p>“You just go to the side, pay your money and you keep your mouth closed and (the state says), ‘We spend it how we want to.’ It’s called being bullied and being bullied is a serious thing nowadays,” Hopkins said at a news conference.</p>

<p>“We are tired of getting put to the side. We are tired of standing alone and we’re ready to get up and fight for it because we have that right. Mississippi is a great state and I love Mississippi. I love my country. I want to be able to vote. I want to be able to say I matter. I want to be able to say my children’s life matters.”</p>

<p>A bill that would have created a study committee to examine Mississippi’s voter disenfranchisement laws died, after it passed the House but was not taken up in the Senate.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves has extended his temporary block on the Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks.</p>

<p>Gov. Phil Bryant signed the law, the strictest in the United States, on March 19. The state’s only abortion clinic, Jackson Women’s Health Clinic, sued the state immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>Reeves issued a temporary restraining order March 20 to block the law for 10 days. On Wednesday, he extended the block until April 13, giving attorneys for the clinic and the state more time to work on legal arguments.</p>

<p>OXFORD – Addressing the troubling history of race in America, two native Mississippi authors — a seasoned historian and a veteran journalist — dive into race relations in the North and South and how much hasn’t changed in today’s society.</p>

<p>“A Conversation About Race” is one of many conversations hosted at the Overby Center for Southern Journalism and Politics at the University of Mississippi in the lead up to the 50th anniversary of the death of Martin Luther King Jr. in an effort to reflect on a time that changed the course of history.</p>

<p>Throughout the conversation, Eugene Dattel, cultural and economic historian and author, talked about a recurring theme of how white people in the North did not want to see African-Americans prosper economically, educationally or politically and wanted to keep them in the South.</p>

<p>He added that this attitude of white Northerners is an ignored part of history.</p>

<p>Aallyah Wright, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Eugene Dattel addressing crowd at Overby Center for the discussion on race</p>

<p>“We know that the abolitionists ended slavery, but we don’t know as much about their attitudes towards black people. Generally, they were anti-black,” said Dattel. “Their great fear was of a migration North of black people.”</p>

<p>He went on to mention how Connecticut disenfranchised its two percent black population in the 1800s, starting a colonization society to encourage African-Americans to move to Africa.</p>

<p>States including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Oregon had exclusion laws to keep black people out of their region, he said.</p>

<p>“They passed laws to give African Americans the rights in the South so they wouldn’t move North,” said Dattel. “Between 1865 and 1914, the black migration North did not exist. The black population in the North stayed under two percent.”</p>

<p>According to Dattel, white wealth accumulation increased 84 percent in the last 30 years, three times that of the black population. White home ownership is up 71 percent while black home ownership saw a 41 percent increase. Black Americans own only two percent of businesses with paid employees, and more than 56 percent of black high school students need remedial work, he said.</p>

<p>“The difference between what happened in the 1960s and now is dramatic,” said Dattel.</p>

<p>So, what role did the media play then versus now?</p>

<p>In the 1880s and 1890s, Dattel said, journalism followed the Southern path in terms of attitudes towards black people.</p>

<p>He gave examples of how The New York Times agreed with segregated school systems in the Midwest, approved of radical judges of the Supreme Court who neutered civil rights laws and wanted to start cotton production again by getting white ingenuity and black labor.</p>

<p>Otis Sanford, former managing editor of the Commercial Appeal says diversity is one of the casualties of today’s newspaper climate.</p>

<p>Otis Sanford, former managing editor of The Commercial Appeal in Memphis and professor at the University of Memphis, spoke to his experience as an African-American journalist and the emerging diversity of the newsroom in the early 1970s, which he noted has fallen by the wayside today.</p>

<p>“I came to this university in 1973, and I was not the only African-American in the journalism program. We had several, and a lot of us got jobs coming out of this department. I was the first African-American male hired at The Clarion-Ledger (in Jackson),” he said.</p>

<p>The Kerner Commission, also known as the President’s National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, released an extensive study on race in America that stated news organizations need to reflect the makeup of their community, Sanford said, and when looking at newsrooms, editors felt they needed more diversity.</p>

<p>The commission consisted of 11 members who were appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson to find out the causes of urban race riots, and in turn, provide solutions in 1967.</p>

<p>This report noted that the nation was moving towards a separate and unequal nation with two societies, a black society and a white society. As a result, they wanted to increase help to black communities to “prevent further racial violence and polarization,” according to history.com.</p>

<p>With continuing progression, major newspapers started to aggressively hire African Americans during that time, but that is not the case today, said Sanford.</p>

<p>“Now with retrenchment when newspapers are downsizing and getting rid of staff, that has totally gone by the wayside,” said Sanford.</p>

<p>Despite being an African-American journalist, Sanford said, he was blessed to not be typecast as a journalist, or as an editor, who covers certain topics based on his race. He has covered politics, police and local government— to name a few.</p>

<p>“It goes beyond race. Race is one of the things that I like to talk about and that I like to research and study because it provides a fascinating insight to where we are, where we’ve been and I think where we’re headed,” he said.</p>

<p>In today’s world, racial inequality still exists along with resistance to being inclusive, whether it’s holding separate graduations for white, black and Hispanic students in the Northeast or unfairly judging someone for mentoring a student of a different race.</p>

<p>White students and black students don’t fully integrate until they meet on a college level whether in the classroom or social events, said Dattel.</p>

<p>“The classroom is the perfect place to hash out ideas and look at different perspectives,” said Dattel. “In that context I adhere to, and Otis as well, there are universal standards … those universal standards are civility and respect and listening and questioning and a knowledge base.”</p>

<p>Despite the ongoing tensions of race in America, the theme of universal standards brought Dattel and Sanford together, becoming friends, they said.</p>

<p>But in 30 years to come, an audience member asked, will there ever be harmony and a minority-majority, with whites being the latter, among Mississippians?</p>

<p>Sanford said its unlikely.</p>

<p>“As much as I love my home state, Mississippi has always struggled with conformity and so I still see a lot of tension there. A lot of it depends on politics and who’s politically in control, and what kind of mindset those folks will have 20, 30 years from now,” said Sanford.</p>

<p>“Its hard to say because I honestly believe that’s one of the great fears that drives our political discourse today is the fact that minority-majority, not just state, but majority-minority nation is what’s driving a lot of the tension and concern right now.”</p>

<p>In the future, will the conversation of race stop being brought to the forefront and stop being romanticized as it has been, asked another audience member.</p>

<p>“I don’t think we’re ever going to get away from the conversation about race … this country is not nearly ready to do that,” said Sanford.</p>

<p id="byline">by: R.L. Nave</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-28</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/03/29/rep-andy-gipson-moves-into-ag-commissioner-job/ </p>

<p>Andy Gipson, a Republican state lawmaker from Braxton, accepts Gov. Phil Bryant’s invitation to serve as Mississippi’s new Agriculture and Commerce Commissioner.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, bid farewell to his colleagues in the Mississippi House of Representatives — but at the time he couldn’t admit that he would be yielding the floor for good.</p>

<p>Everything made sense one day later when Gov. Phil Bryant announced Gipson as the next state Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce, succeeding Cindy Hyde-Smith who will soon head to Washington, D.C., and the U.S. Senate.</p>

<p>Gipson, 41, said his family did not have to pray long on the decision to accept Bryant’s offer, joking that the opportunity is “a bullet that fit our gun.”</p>

<p>One of the most vocal social conservatives in state government, Gipson has made a name for himself championing such issues as promoting gun rights, limiting abortion and cracking down on illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Andy Gipson, a Republican state lawmaker from Braxton, holds ones of his daughters and speaks with well-wishers in Jackson after the announcement that he would take the reins as state Agriculture Commissioner.</p>

<p>“Whether we’re rural, whether we’re urban, we all need it,” he said. “As a matter of fact, civilization exists because of agriculture. Agriculture unites us because it provides all the basic human needs of food — you have to have it to live — of fiber — you’ve got to have some clothes to wear — and of shelter, and we know something about timber right here in the great state of Mississippi,” Gipson said Thursday afternoon at the Ag Museum at a press conference announcing his new role.</p>

<p>Gipson will begin officially on Monday, when he plans to meet with the staff of the Agriculture Commission and help select a new executive director for the State Fairgrounds. Gipson will also oversee a $55 million renovation of the Trademart and said he plans to expand agritourism and promote livestock shows and farmers’ markets.</p>

<p>He also wants to grow the Mississippi State Fair and go on an agriculture listening tour of the state to talk to farmers.</p>

<p>Gispon is an attorney with Jones Walker, a law firm in Jackson, where he specializes in securities, banking, communications and insurance. Gipson has served in the House since 2008 representing District 77, which includes parts of Simpson and Rankin counties. That year, he beat Democratic challenger Dale Berry 58 percent to Berry’s 40 percent.</p>

<p>Democrats still controlled the House at the time, but Gipson was given two vice-chairmanships — Investigative State Offices and Poverty.</p>

<p>In 2017, Gipson made national headlines for killing a bill that would have made domestic violence grounds for divorce in Mississippi. He later worked to rework wording in the state code to provide that protection.</p>

<p>Gipson and his wife, Leslie, raise cattle and chickens on their Braxton farm and own a coffee shop in D’lo. They have four children, two boys and two girls.</p>

<p>He also said he plans to work closely with the state’s congressional delegations as well as the Trump Administration, which Gipson credited for rolling back “burdensome” regulations on the agriculture industry.</p>

<p>He added that he wants Mississippians to reconnect to life on the farm.</p>

<p>“People in our society have come to forget that milk in a grocery store didn’t come from the grocery store. It didn’t come in a plastic jug, young people, it came from a milk cow on a farm somewhere. Beans in a can didn’t come from a factory, it came from the dirt in the form of a vine or bush somewhere,” Gipson said.</p>

<p>Gov. Bryant said he would announce in coming weeks the dates for a special election to fill the House District 77 seat Gipson is vacating.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/03/30/group-working-to-change-state-flag-reports-kkk-threat/ </p>

<p>A group working to change the state flag, which is the last in the nation containing the Confederate battle emblem, says it received a YouTube video and warning from the Ku Klux Klan, WLOX TV reported.</p>

<p>A man in the YouTube video posted by United Dixie White Knights says: “Y’all aren’t going to take down our flag. We gonna fight.” The video has since been taken down by YouTube.</p>

<p>Mississippi Rising Coalition, the activist group working to remove the flag, held a press conference Wednesday in Ocean Springs to respond to the threat.</p>

<p>“We believe you sent this to us with the intent not only to intimidate, but in the hopes that we would react publicly,” coalition president Lea Campbell said. “You get your wish. We are eager to confront you, your hateful bigotry, white supremacy and your allies publicly.”</p>

<p>Rep. David Baria, D-Bay St. Louis, issued a statement Friday stating, “Hateful threats should have no place in our discourse and I think part of the responsibility is on us as public officials to call this behavior out when it happens. … This week demonstrates that we need all good Mississippians to keep doing good work and remain vocal.”</p>

<p>Baria is a candidate for the Democratic nomination to challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker.</p>

<h2 id="judgetemporarilyhaltsnewabortionban">Judge temporarily halts new abortion ban</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Larrison Campbell</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/03/20/judge-temporarily-halts-new-abortion-ban/ </p>

<p>Just 18 hours after Gov. Phil Bryant signed the nation’s toughest abortion ban into law, a federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, saying the law is likely to be found unconstitutional.</p>

<p>Within an hour of the signing on Monday afternoon, the Jackson Women’s Health Clinic sued the state over its ban, which prohibits abortions at the 15th week of pregnancy. The clinic, which is Mississippi’s only abortion provider, had argued that banning abortions so early violates a woman’s constitutional right to have an abortion before the fetus is viable.</p>

<p>That evening, the plaintiffs asked for a temporary restraining order, saying that a woman currently in her 15th week of pregnancy had been scheduled for an abortion at 2 p.m. Tuesday. On Tuesday morning, U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves agreed with the plaintiffs, issuing a temporary restraining order on the law for 10 days.</p>

<p>“The law threatens immediate, irreparable harm to Mississippians’ abilities to control their ‘destiny and … body.’ This is especially true for one woman scheduled to have a 15-week abortion this afternoon. A brief delay in enforcing a law of dubious constitutionality does not outweigh that harm, and in fact serves the public’s interest in preserving the freedom guaranteed by the United States Constitution,” Reeves said in his order.</p>

<p>In 10 days, the court will decide whether to enter a preliminary injunction on the law, which would bar it from taking effect until the court has determined its constitutionality.</p>

<p>The governor has been a vocal advocate of restricting abortion since taking office in 2012, and he called Reeves’s decision “disappointing.”</p>

<p>“House Bill 1510 protects maternal health and will further our efforts to make Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child. We are confident in its constitutionality and look forward to vigorously defending it,” Bryant said in a email Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Shortly before the hearing on Tuesday he had tweeted, “I pray today that we have saved the first life of an unborn child in Mississippi.”</p>

<p>The Jackson Women’s Health Clinic performs abortions until the 16th week of pregnancy. This week, it performed those procedures only on Monday and Tuesday. As a result, the clinic had argued that delaying the procedure even by one week means the woman with the 2 p.m. appointment would be unable to have an abortion in Mississippi, violating her constitutional rights.</p>

<p>“Irreparable harm exists not only this afternoon but in the coming weeks for women in this state,” said Rob McDuff, an attorney for the plaintiffs.</p>

<p>No other state has successfully banned abortions before 20 weeks gestation, generally considered the very earliest point of viability for a fetus. In previous Supreme Court cases, constitutionality has hinged on two things: whether the fetus is viable and whether restrictions on abortion before that point of viability place an “undue burden” on the woman seeking an abortion. Laws that the courts decide do place an undue burden have been overturned.</p>

<p>Although Tuesday’s hearing was only on the motion for a temporary restraining order, it offered a preview of what is likely to be a long constitutional battle, as supporters of the 15-week ban try to chip away at the idea that a viable fetus is the only thing that outweighs a woman’s right to an abortion.</p>

<p>In his arguments for the state, Paul Barnes, special assistant attorney general, suggested that, thanks to advances in medical technology, fetal viability may now be earlier than the established court precedent of 23 weeks, an echo of arguments some legislators made earlier this month.</p>

<p>“We are confident we will be able to develop proof that at least some fetuses protected by this law are viable,” Barnes said.</p>

<p>Because old state law prohibited abortions at 20 weeks, only pregnancies up to that point are affected by the new law. No fetus has survived outside the womb before 20 weeks.</p>

<p>But Barnes also suggested that viability is a “constantly moving line,” arguing that while a fetus at 15 weeks may not be technically viable, the increased likelihood of fetal viability should be taken into account.</p>

<p>Reeves pointed out that judicial precedent draws a hard line at actual viability.</p>

<p>“Where there is no viability, does the state’s right to protect that fetus trump a woman’s right to make decisions over her own body?” Reeves asked.</p>

<p>Although Mississippi’s ban does not touch abortions performed before 15 weeks, abortion advocates have argued that allowing a ban on pre-viability abortions would open the door to making all abortions illegal. Last month a member of the Louisiana House also introduced a bill that would ban abortions at 15 weeks.</p>

<p>There’s also evidence that conservative groups across the U.S. have an eye on Mississippi. Representatives from the American Family Association, a Christian fundamentalist organization, attended yesterday’s bill signing in the governor’s office. The Mississippi Center for Public Policy’s Jameson Taylor said that the Arizona-based Alliance Defending Freedom vetted the bill’s language, as did other organizations. Bob Trent, a spokesperson for Alliance Defending Freedom said, “From time to time lawmakers ask ADF attorneys to review the constitutionality of proposed legislation. ADF supports states’ important and legitimate efforts to protect the health and safety of women and children.”</p>

<p>Alliance Defending Freedom also was a key player in defending Mississippi’s House Bill 1523, known as the Protecting Freedom of Conscience From Government Discrimination Act, two years ago. The American Family Association is one of the coalition of groups in ADF.</p>

<p>Reeves seemed to note the significance of setting the ban at 15 weeks specifically, which is just early enough to trigger a court case in Mississippi. Because the Jackson Women’s Health Clinic only performs abortions up to the 16th week of pregnancy, and it is the only clinic in the state that performs abortion, no one in the state would have standing to challenge a later ban.</p>

<p>“Did they say why they went for 15 weeks when the state unilaterally doesn’t provide abortions after 16 weeks?” Reeves asked.</p>

<p>Barnes said he didn’t know why the state chose that 15 weeks, but he acknowledged that the one week difference meant the law wouldn’t actually affect many unborn children in the state. Approximately 2000 abortions are performed in Mississippi each year. In 2017, only 78 of those were performed after the 15th week of pregnancy.</p>

<p>“It’s not as if there are hundreds of abortions performed every year that this will stop,” Barnes said.</p>

<p>But Barnes also said that the life of the fetus was just one of many interests the state had. Flipping the script on McDuff’s arguments, Barnes argued that “irreparable harm” was far more likely to be caused by the abortion procedure than by denying it.</p>

<p>“The clinic chooses not to perform abortions after the 16th week. And the reason is that they are riskier and more complicated,” Barnes said, listing several complications such as blood clots and cervical rupture that increase with gestational age of the fetus. “The reason they choose not to is a tacit admission of part of our argument.”</p>

<p>Barnes cited a report from the American College of Obsetrics that showed that the risks of abortion increases with the gestational age of a fetus. Plaintiffs did not dispute these findings but argued that even late term abortion carries far fewer health risks to the woman than childbirth. A study released on Friday from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine determined that abortion is one of the safest surgical procedures in the United States.</p>

<p>In his closing arguments, McDuff called the argument that risk increases with gestational age a tactic to unravel the right to abortion.</p>

<p>“If that argument is considered to be legitimate, the state could continue to dial back abortion until it is eviscerated,” McDuff said. “Viability increases at the 12th week, it increases at the 6th week, it increases at zero weeks… They could completely abolish abortion.”</p>

<p>Still, the state’s interest in protecting maternal health remained central to the argument against granting the temporary restraining order. Barnes argued that restrictions on abortion before the point of viability had been upheld in appellate courts and at the U.S. Supreme Court. He cited Gonzales v. Carhart, a 2007 case that banned a certain type of abortion procedure before fetal viability because the court determined that it was not necessary for the health of the woman.</p>

<p>McDuff called these arguments for the state to protect women’s health a backdoor way of regulating their behavior.</p>

<p>“The reason for this law is to prevent women from making their own choices and to make them bear their pregnancies,” McDuff said. “And the Supreme Court has said time and again that is unconstitutional. This one is going to have to be struck down again. This is beyond undue burden. This is a ban.”</p>

<p>In his argument, Barnes pointed out that the burden of proof for the restraining order was on the plaintiffs, but at times it felt like the burden was on the state as Reeves challenged Barnes to provide a constitutional or scientific basis for the state’s arguments.</p>

<p>The abortion bill itself details a number of health risks about abortion. Reeves questioned the findings in the law, wondering if the Legislature had held a public hearing on the bill or something where he could reference the logic behind these claims. Barnes pointed to the study from the American College of Obstetrics but said, to his knowledge, lawmakers had not held a hearing.</p>

<p>“But what evidence do we have besides this study, when other states have struck down bans before 20 weeks?” Reeves asked. “Should I give the legislature that much deference? I don’t know if doctors came in and testified at that hearing. I don’t know if there was a hearing. Lots of stuff happens at that Legislature that just should not happen.”</p>

<p>Supporters of the 15-week ban have often argued that 75 percent of nations don’t allow abortion after the first trimester, which is approximately 12 weeks into a pregnancy. Barnes repeated this statistic, saying Mississippi was simply bringing its law up to the international standard.</p>

<p>Reeves didn’t buy it.</p>

<p>“Does this state typically look and see what other countries are doing to determine legislation? That’s a rare instance that Mississippi looks to other countries for guidance,” Reeves said with a chuckle.</p>

<p>Kate Royals/Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Lawrence Blackmon is a plaintiff in the lawsuit against the Madison County Sheriff’s Department.</p>

<p>Attorneys in a federal lawsuit against the Madison County Sheriff’s Department presented new data they say supports their case that the defendants practice discriminatory and unconstitutional policing tactics.</p>

<p>The data shows that over a five year period from 2012 to 2017 in Madison County: blacks accounted for 77 percent of all arrests, 72 percent of all citations and nearly 76 percent of arrests at roadblocks. In addition, more than 74 percent of arrests at traffic stops were of blacks, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>

<p>African Americans make up 38 percent of the county’s population.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs attorneys are asking the legal challenge be deemed a class-action lawsuit, a request they say is supported by those statistics.</p>

<p>“MCSD’s own paperwork confirms that it targets black citizens for arrest,” said Joshua Tom, legal director for the ACLU of Mississippi. “In the course of our class certification discovery, MCSD officials produced template forms that deputies use in the course of their duties, and on those forms from at least two officers appear pre-populated check boxes marking ‘black,’ ‘male,’ and ‘arrested.’ The evidence will show discriminatory and unconstitutional policing, and we are looking forward to presenting all of the facts as our case moves forward.”</p>

<p>Madison County Attorney Katie Snell said the sheriff’s department does not comment on pending litigation, but the defendants’ prior response in court denied any racist or discriminatory practices.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and the New York-based law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP, accuse the sheriff’s department of running a “top-down program” of selectively targeting black communities with unconstitutional policing tactics such as “show-ID-and-search pedestrian checkpoints, roving roadblocks, ‘jump outs’ by plainclothes deputies in unmarked cars and warrantless home invasions,” a release from the ACLU stated.</p>

<p>Madison County Sheriff Randy Tucker</p>

<p>At a news conference announcing the findings, plaintiff Lawrence Blackmon spoke about his experience with sheriff’s department officials. He says deputies forced his way into his Canton home without a warrant one night looking for his cousin.</p>

<p>“(They) made me lay face down on the floor and handcuffed me at gunpoint and proceeded to search my home for my cousin who I informed them was no longer living there at that time,” Blackmon said. “I asked them to produce a warrant and they would not.”</p>

<p>Blackmon said this is one of many such incidents in his community.</p>

<p>“(It was) another reminder of the fact that being black in Madison County oftentimes means that your constitutional rights can be disregarded by overzealous Madison County Sheriff’s Department deputies,” he said.</p>

<p>Attorneys representing the sheriff’s department have until May 8 to respond.</p>

<p>“MCSD’s own paperwork confirms that it targets black citizens for arrest,” said Joshua Tom, legal director for the ACLU of Mississippi. “In the course of our class certification discovery, MCSD officials produced template forms that deputies use in the course of their duties, and on those forms from at least two officers appear pre-populated check boxes marking ‘black,’ ‘male,’ and ‘arrested.’ The evidence will show discriminatory and unconstitutional policing, and we are looking forward to presenting all of the facts as our case moves forward.”</p>

<p>Madison County Attorney Katie Snell said the sheriff’s department does not comment on pending litigation, but the defendants’ prior response in court denied any racist or discriminatory practices.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and the New York-based law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP, accuse the sheriff’s department of running a “top-down program” of selectively targeting black communities with unconstitutional policing tactics such as “show-ID-and-search pedestrian checkpoints, roving roadblocks, ‘jump outs’ by plainclothes deputies in unmarked cars and warrantless home invasions,” a release from the ACLU stated.</p>

<p>Madison County Sheriff Randy Tucker</p>

<p>At a news conference announcing the findings, plaintiff Lawrence Blackmon spoke about his experience with sheriff’s department officials. He says deputies forced his way into his Canton home without a warrant one night looking for his cousin.</p>

<p>“(They) made me lay face down on the floor and handcuffed me at gunpoint and proceeded to search my home for my cousin who I informed them was no longer living there at that time,” Blackmon said. “I asked them to produce a warrant and they would not.”</p>

<p>Blackmon said this is one of many such incidents in his community.</p>

<p>“(It was) another reminder of the fact that being black in Madison County oftentimes means that your constitutional rights can be disregarded by overzealous Madison County Sheriff’s Department deputies,” he said.</p>

<p>Attorneys representing the sheriff’s department have until May 8 to respond.</p>

<h2 id="childprotectionservicesoncelaudednowinmajorviolationofcourtorder">Child Protection Services, once lauded, now in major violation of court order</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Larrison Campbell</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-12</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/03/13/child-protection-services-once-lauded-now-in-contempt-of-court/ </p>

<p>This story has been revised to reflect the fact that while Child Protection Services is in non-compliance of a court order regarding caseloads, the agency is not in contempt of court until a judge issues an order of contempt.</p>

<p>The state’s Department of Child Protection Services has once again violated a court order in the long-running Olivia Y settlement, the lawsuit responsible for dismantling and then rebuilding the state’s foster care system, according to a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case.</p>

<p>Last week, Marcia Lowry of the New York-based firm A Better Childhood sent a letter of non-compliance to Child Protection Services. According to the letter, the agency has been in violation of a court order since Dec. 31 for not employing enough caseworkers to properly monitor children in the system, a breach of the agreement signed just 15 months ago.</p>

<p>A Better Childhood</p>

<p>“We were living, perhaps, in a fool’s paradise,” Lowry said by telephone. “We had been assured last year that they would be in compliance.”</p>

<p>When contacted by Mississippi Today, CPS commissioner Jess Dickinson, who took the reins in September, did not dispute Lowry’s findings, which showed that more than 39 percent of caseworkers at the agency had caseloads that were too high. According to the most recent consent agreement, that number should have been just 10 percent by the end of 2017.</p>

<p>Dickinson said he was aware the agency had fallen short but had hoped for leniency from the plaintiffs until the agency had the funds to comply with the settlement.</p>

<p>“We are not going to be able to comply this fiscal year,” Dickinson said. “We’re doing the best we can. And hopefully we will get properly funded (for next year), and if we do, we think we can take care of this problem.”</p>

<p>If the agency remains non-compliant a judge could find the agency in contempt, risking court takeover, though Lowry calls this a last resort. Lowry said she will meet with the agency within the next 30 days to discuss next steps.</p>

<p>It’s a stunning reversal for the young agency. Although the Olivia Y litigation has dragged on for 14 years, since the Legislature created the new Department of Child Protection Services in 2016, the agency seemed to be moving in the right direction. Last year, former commissioner David Chandler received a national award for improvements to the state system, and in his State of the State speech in January, Gov. Phil Bryant made a point of praising the agency and Dickinson.</p>

<p>But CPS’s violation of the court order is one in a series of high-profile snafus the agency has experienced in recent months. On the same day as Bryant’s State of the State, Dickinson shocked lawmakers when he told the Senate Appropriations Committee that CPS was facing a $39 million deficit for 2018.</p>

<p>“It’s just kind of blown us away,” Senate Appropriations Chair Buck Clarke, R-Hollandale, said in January. “Everything we’d heard up to that point was that the agency was fine.”</p>

<p>But, according to Dickinson, the agency was not fine. A legislative error had caused CPS to miss out on tens of millions of dollars in federal matching funds from the Department of Human Services. Legislators, who have largely assumed responsibility for the error, have said they calculated the agency’s budget assuming those funds would be available.</p>

<p>Dickinson has maintained that he discovered the problems with CPS within weeks of taking the agency reins, although he did not inform legislators until December. The previous administration at CPS was either unaware of the issue or had not informed lawmakers about the problem, he said.</p>

<p>By working with the Department of Human Services and making internal changes, the agency ultimately reduced its deficit request to $12 million. The trade-off of reducing the budget, however, has been massive spending cuts. As a result, CPS will not be able to increase the number of caseworkers this year, meaning the agency is getting even farther away from the compliance goals agreed upon in the settlement.</p>

<p>But Dickinson said Monday that the deficit has nothing to do with the accusation of non-compliance. In fact, he said the agency wasn’t on track to comply with the settlement long before the deficit was uncovered, bolstering claims he has made since January that the agency was already in disarray when he came on board last fall.</p>

<p>Mississippi Child Protection Services commissioner Jess Dickinson</p>

<p>“The deficit had nothing to do with the fact that we were not in compliance as of Dec. 31,” Dickinson said, referring to the date by which Lowry’s letter said CPS had violated the order. “We never stopped trying to hire as many people as we could hire, but we haven’t been able to keep them. … And we determined that a major factor in our ability to hire and retain staff was their low pay.”</p>

<p>In January, the state Personnel Board gave CPS permission to raise the salaries of its caseworkers, who work directly with families and children in the foster care system, from approximately $26,000 to $30,000 a year. Dickinson said that has stemmed the turnover, but by the time the raise was implemented, the deficit had been uncovered. The agency could not afford to spend more on salaries than it was already spending.</p>

<p>When asked about Dickinson’s assessment, former commissioner Chandler said that during his tenure the agency was on track to be compliant with the settlement agreement, which he had signed the year before.</p>

<p>“I have talked with every employee who held a key management position in my administration and they unanimously agree that during our entire administration: 1. We always met all requirements of the federal court order and we accomplished this within budget. 2. At my departure, we were confident that the foundation we had established would enable CPS to continue meeting all requirements of the federal court order within budget. 3. Despite the challenges of the federal litigation, we made sure that every single day our focus was on the best interest of every single Mississippi Child.”</p>

<p>Lowry agreed that the agency made significant strides in complying with the other terms of the settlement agreement last year. These included licensing more than 500 unlicensed foster homes, establishing protocol to prioritize severe cases and providing all caseworkers with computers or tablets for field work.</p>

<p>“They did a lot of good things during 2017,” Lowry said. “(But) the goal was to build capacity so that by the time we got to 2018 we were able to deliver on these conditions. … We were hopeful this was going to be a new era for Mississippi’s Department of Child Protection Services.”</p>

<p>But why the new CPS finds itself repeating old patterns remains unclear, according to Lowry. She said the budget that Chandler submitted to the court last year showed “a lot more federal income” than the agency said it ultimately received. But Lowry said that until she receives more data she won’t know where the breakdown occurred or who was ultimately responsible for it.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the most recent settlement agreement from 2016, CPS had avoided being closely monitored by the plaintiffs, according to Lowry. Lowery said that is likely to change.</p>

<p>“Somebody here is not being candid, and I don’t know who it is,” Lowry said. “All I know now is that they are not in compliance with the settlement. I think the kids of Mississippi deserve better.”</p>

<p>Under Olivia Y, which was filed in 2004, six children in foster care sued the state of Mississippi for failing to adequately provide for children in its custody. A federal court sided with the plaintiffs, known collectively as Olivia Y, and the resulting settlement has completely remade the agency.</p>

<p>Arguably the biggest mandate was to turn Mississippi’s former Division of Family and Children Services, which had once been housed within the Department of Human Services, into a standalone agency.</p>

<p>But doing so made the agency ineligible for certain federal funds the agency had received as part of the Department of Human Services. Legislative leaders, for their part, have largely taken responsibility for that oversight, and a bill that would make CPS a sub-agency of DHS—and therefore eligible for its higher match rate—is likely to end up on the governor’s desk.</p>

<p>Although state officials often mention Child Protection Services as a priority, Lowry notes that the part of the settlement that the agency failed to comply with — hiring staff — was also the one that cost the most money. And deciding whether the agency receives that money, Lowry said, is ultimately the responsibility of the state’s elected officials.</p>

<p>If filling the deficit won’t help the agency meet its contractual obligations, Lowry said, the Legislature needs to give the agency enough money so that it can.</p>

<p>“They need to do something and they’re not doing it,” Lowry said. “I don’t know at this point what the problem is, but certainly the state ought to be able to come up with the money so they can fund the employees.</p>

<p>“They absolutely have to do that. They can’t run the agency constitutionally without it.”</p>

<h2 id="starkvilleapprovesprideparadereversingearliervote">Starkville approves Pride Parade, reversing earlier vote</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Larrison Campbell</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-05</p>

<p>Starkville Mayor Lynn Spruill</p>

<p>The Starkville Board of Aldermen voted Tuesday to allow the city’s first gay pride parade, a stunning reversal of its vote to block the parade two weeks ago.</p>

<p>None of the aldermen changed their vote, technically speaking. Ward 3 Alderman David Little abstained, allowing Mayor Lynn Spruill, who has been a vocal advocate of the pride parade, to break a 3-3 tie and cast the deciding vote.</p>

<p>“I feel like I’ve had a lot more time in the last few weeks to ponder this,” Little said. “… I believe the city of Starkville’s interests are best served by moving forward beyond this and pressing forward on other positive matters facing our community. That being said, while I maintain my principal decision I abstain on my vote.”</p>

<p>Although Spruill remained impassive for much of the debate Tuesday, after casting her tie-breaking vote, she cracked the slightest smile. Spruill has been very public in her support of the parade and her concern over “what kind of message” refusing to allow it sent.</p>

<p>“Absolutely I’m hopeful that it might change. I’ve made no secret of the fact that it’s a vote that does not represent the Starkville community,” Spruill said before the meeting Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>The parade is scheduled for March 24.</p>

<p>Since the board’s 4-3 vote on Feb. 20, Starkville has been mired in controversy over the board’s refusal to grant Starkville Pride a parade permit. Within hours of the vote, national media had picked up the story, and constitutional law experts had begun predicting a lengthy legal battle—one they said Starkville was likely to lose.</p>

<p>“This is a blatant violation of the Constitution,” said attorney Rob McDuff, who has challenged the state on several constitutional matters and is not involved in the Starkville lawsuit.</p>

<p>According to Ward 5 Alderman Patrick Miller, the board has not rejected an event permit since 2010. During the hearing, no board member raised concerns about the details of the permit application.</p>

<p>Two Starkville residents, however, did speak out against the parade permit in that Feb. 20 meeting. Both cited concerns that a parade for gay, lesbian and transgender people would, in essence, present a public conflict with their religious views. According to the lawsuit, filed in federal court on Feb. 26, the city’s refusal violated residents’ First Amendment freedom of speech, assembly, and petition and the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p>“The city banned plaintiffs from speaking in a public forum solely because it disagreed with the viewpoint and content of their speech. That hostility to their message was inextricably intertwined with hostility to their LGBT identity and pro-LGBT advocacy,” states the lawsuit.</p>

<p>Mississippi Today has reached out to all four of the Starkville aldermen who voted against the parade, including Little, multiple times since the initial vote, but none has responded to requests for comments.</p>

<p>Ward 4 Alderman Jason Walker, who voted for the parade, predicted that defending the lawsuit could “easily cost the city six figures,” and given the outcome he said it would be a waste of taxpayer resources.</p>

<p>“I think all the aldermen have been notified by the city attorney by now that it’s not a case we can win. We’ll see if that persuaded anyone to change their vote,” Walker said hours before the meeting Tuesday.</p>

<p>Although Little did not say so explicitly, his comments about “moving forward beyond this” on Tuesday night suggested that the specter of a long, expensive legal battle hung heavy on town leadership.</p>

<p>Given that Starkville has reversed its vote, the status of the lawsuit is currently up in the air. One of the attorneys representing Starkville Pride is Roberta Kaplan, who in the last three years successfully sued the state over is ban on gay marriage and gay adoptions.</p>

<p>But why Little, alone, abstained on the issue remains unclear.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Chip Stevens, the pastor at First Baptist Church in Starkville, where Little is a member, gave a sermon about the controversy surrounding the Pride Parade. Although the Southern Baptist Convention, of which First Baptist is a member, has long been publicly opposed to the mainstreaming of gay culture, Stevens had a different take on opposition to the parade.</p>

<p>“Sometimes with a church when we’re faced with social issues we begin to panic and we begin to scramble and we begin to twist verses and we begin to just react. And we want the government to do what God has called the church to do, and we do it under the guise of ‘we cannot be silent on these issues,'” Stevens said in his sermon.</p>

<p>“Could it be that the problems that we face in our world are not because we’ve been silent on issues but because we’ve been silent with the gospel?”</p>

<p>The permit approved on Tuesday differed slightly from the one denied two weeks earlier. Ward 2 Alderman Sandra Sistrunk, an advocate of the parade, moved to allow the it but this time without Starkville being an official sponsor, a move she admitted was partly “a question of optics.”</p>

<p>“If that was the stumbling block, I didn’t want it to be a stumbling block,” Sistrunk said after the meeting Tuesday.</p>

<p>In recent years, Starkville has had a rocky relationship with LGBT issues. In 2014, Starkville became the first town in Mississippi to pass an anti-discrimination resolution that included sexual orientation and identity, and later the city added a policy that extended health benefits to domestic partners of city employees.</p>

<p>But months later, the city quietly repealed both policies under pressure from local religious leaders, according to members of the board of aldermen.</p>

<p>Part of this is that this is also a time of growth and transition for Starkville, itself, according to many residents who live there. Starkville, like many towns along the eastern side of the state, has strong small-town agrarian roots. But unlike most of those towns, Starkville is growing, rapidly. This is due in large part to Mississippi State, a thriving university that brings money and jobs and youth to a part of the state rarely teeming with any of these things.</p>

<p>“If it weren’t for Mississippi State, it’d be like Sturgis, here,” said Trace Day, a lifelong Starkville resident. “It’d be a little hole in the wall.”</p>

<p>And while residents of Starkville, which calls itself ‘Mississippi’s College Town,’ rarely miss an opportunity to express their love for their local university, it’s also true that the people Mississippi State attracts are often younger and more diverse than local residents, with nearly a third of the students and more than half of the professors hailing from out of state.</p>

<p>“We interact more with the university now than we have in the past, and more of the students live among us in the community. We’re not that 1950s town or even that 2010 town that some people hope we’ll go back to being. And we just need to be mindful of the greater community and how different people might see what to me was a very routine administrative matter,” Sistrunk said.</p>

<p>“I do think it’s a kind of growing pains moment for the city. But we’ll get better at this.”</p>

<h2 id="senatepassesmostrestrictiveabortionbillinthecountry">Senate passes most restrictive abortion bill in the country</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Larrison Campbell</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-05</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/03/06/senate-passes-restrictive-abortion-bill-country/ </p>

<p>The Senate passed a ban on abortions after 15 weeks, meaning Mississippi is almost one signature away from having the most restrictive abortion law in the country.</p>

<p>That signature belongs to Gov. Phil Bryant, who has consistently expressed interest in tightening Mississippi’s abortion laws. After Tuesday’s 35-14 vote for House Bill 1520 in the Senate, Bryant said he looked forward to signing the bill should it meet approval in the House of Representatives, where it’s currently headed for concurrence.</p>

<p>“As I have repeatedly said, I want Mississippi to be the safest place in America for an unborn child. House Bill 1510 will help us achieve that goal, and I look forward to signing it if and when the House concurs,” Bryant said.</p>

<p>Currently, no state in the country restricts abortion earlier than 20 weeks gestation. A precedent-setting piece of legislation such as House Bill 1510 likely faces a stiff legal challenge.</p>

<p>Those in favor of the bill said they’re prepared for it.</p>

<p>Rogelio V. Solis, AP</p>

<p>Sen. Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall</p>

<p>“I certainly feel very strongly about this legislation, and our attorney general has been following the bill very closely in anticipation of a challenge to it,” said Sen. Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall, who presented the legislation to the Senate.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jim Hood said he fully expects that the state will be sued if the governor signs the bill into law.</p>

<p>“We know that bans below 20 weeks have been struck down,” said General Hood, a Democrat. “We expect an immediate and expensive legal challenge.”</p>

<p>If it is challenged, Mississippi may not be alone. Last week a member of the Louisiana House dropped a bill that would also restrict abortion after 15 weeks. Currently no action has been taken on that bill.</p>

<p>“If HB 1510 passes we can expect it to be a template for similar bans across the U.S.,” said Felicia Brown Williams of Planned Parenthood Southeast. “… Jackson Women’s Health Organization has already announced their plans to sue if HB 1510 passes. Ultimately, it will end up at the center of a lengthy and expensive legal battle, with Mississippi taxpayers footing the bill.”</p>

<p>The Senate version makes one big change from the bill that originated in the House, removing a provision that would have imposed criminal penalties on doctors who perform abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The doctors are still subject to professional censure and fines.</p>

<p>As a result of this change, the bill moves back to the House, which will either concur with the Senate’s changes or send the bill to conference. Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, who sponsored the bill, said even without the criminal provision, the bill still had his support.</p>

<p>“The fact that they removed the criminal penalties is not going to affect what we do with the bill when it comes back. I can still support it. I think the House can still support it,” Gipson said.</p>

<p>Although the bill passed by a wide margin, with all Republicans and a handful of Democrats voting in favor of it, the debate on the floor became contentious at several points as several senators pushed Fillingane on the question of fetal viability.</p>

<p>No fetus younger than 20 weeks gestation has survived outside the womb, and despite advances in technology, babies born before 22 weeks rarely survive. But Fillingane said several times on Tuesday that medical advances could one day make fetal viability possible as early as 15 weeks — a crucial point, if true, because under the landmark abortion case Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that women should be able to obtain an abortion at least until the point of fetal viability.</p>

<p>Sen. Angela Turner-Ford, D-West Point, pushed back against the idea that 15 weeks was a potential point of viability.</p>

<p>“Are you aware of any cases where any fetus has been determined as viable at 15 weeks?” Turner asked.</p>

<p>Fillingane said he was not but that viability “is no longer the preeminent issue,” arguing that it was replaced by the question of “undue burden” in a 1992 Supreme Court case. This means that states are not allowed to pass any laws that place an undue burden on a woman’s right to have an abortion — up to the point of fetal viability.</p>

<p>Although Fillingane contended viability was not a preeminent issue, he said, “I think medical technology more than anything else is driving the shortening of the window (for) when these abortions would be considered allowed.”</p>

<p>If the bill passes and is challenged in court, these arguments are likely to be preeminent.</p>

<p>Several senators, all of whom opposed the bill, offered a total of four amendments, though each failed to pass. One of the most contentious was offered by Sen. Deborah Dawkins, D-Pass Christian, requiring the state to pay for child care for any child whose mother did not get an abortion because of this law.</p>

<p>“”If the state of Mississippi is to intercede in family matters and family budgets, it is only fair that we provide the affected children and families with early childhood assistance,” Dawkins said.</p>

<p>The bill initially attracted some bipartisan support with Sen. David Parker, R-Olive Branch, saying he would support the amendment if it were to include payment for child care for any mother who made an appointment for an abortion and then decided against it. Dawkins voiced support for this change, but Fillingane objected to the amendment, arguing that “it wasn’t germane” to the bill.</p>

<p>“Sen. Dawkins’s amendment deals with child care expenses and revenues coming out of the general fund and the bill has nothing to do with that. It only deals with moving 20 weeks up to 15 weeks. It has nothing to do with child care costs or anything that Sen. Dawkins is bringing up,” Fillingane said.</p>

<p>Senate counsel agreed and the amendment was not allowed. But at the end, Sen. Barbara Blackmon made another run at including child care, altering the amendment so that the bill would only take effect if a separate bill providing child care passed.</p>

<p>The Senate conferred for several minutes on this, but ultimately it was also thrown out for the same reasons.</p>

<p>Sen. Derrick Simmons, D-Greenville, tried to amend the bill to include an exception for rape and incest. Although the bill and current state law offer exceptions for abortions after 15 weeks if the health or life of the mother and fetus are imperiled, neither offers an exception for victims of rape.</p>

<p>“In my opinion these are very complex decisions that women have to make and I personally believe those decisions have to be made between those women, their families and their doctors,” Simmons said. “But because we have to have legislative bodies making those decisions and those legislative bodies provide exceptions then I think we should use those exceptions to include an unfortunate occurrence like rape or incest. I think we’ll be supporting women.”</p>

<p>Simmons held the bill on a motion to reconsider.</p>

<h2 id="bariarunsondebunkingrosypicturepaintedbygopleaders">Baria runs on debunking ‘rosy’ picture painted by GOP leaders</h2>

<p id="byline">by: R.L. Nave</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-03-01</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/03/02/baria-runs-debunking-rosy-picture-painted-gop-leaders/ </p>

<p>Rep. David Baria and family at his announcement that he would seek a seat in the U.S. Senate.</p>

<p>BAY ST. LOUIS — Rep. David Baria mentioned none of his challengers by name, but in the formal announcement Friday of his candidacy for the U.S. Senate, he took direct aim at several themes pushed by one high-profile Republican challenger.</p>

<p>The announcement from Baria, 55, who was born in Escatawpa and grew up on the Coast, came two days after state Sen. Chris McDaniel made his candidacy official in his hometown of Ellisville. In his speech, McDaniel drew a line in the sand between “us” (those who believe in his brand of conservatism) and “them” (everyone who doesn’t).</p>

<p>From the steps of the Hancock County Courthouse, and without naming McDaniel, Baria offered a rebuke of us-vs-themism and unwillingness to compromise.</p>

<p>“I think we need to fight together as Mississippians because if this ship is sinking it affects every single one of us. There can be no more us and them when it comes to our jobs, our infrastructure, schools and hospitals,” Baria said.</p>

<p>Baria is perhaps the best known among the Democratic candidates who qualified to run for the U.S. Senate. The field includes his Democratic House colleague, Rep. Omeria Scott, businessman Howard Sherman of Meridian as well as Jensen Bohren of Benton, Jerone Garland of Kosciusko and Victor Maurice of Pass Christian.</p>

<p>The platform Baria laid out was heavy on populist themes such as rebuilding roads and bridges, railways, health care and protecting hospitals, jobs and the economy.</p>

<p>“We’ve dropped the ball on creating and maintaining the basic ingredients for success,” Baria said. “Our current leadership paints a rosy picture of our state and our country. We hear that the stock market is up and unemployment is down, that good jobs are coming back any day now if we just give one more tax cut to corporations.</p>

<p>“Wages aren’t rising fast enough to keep up with inflation and we’ve seen a decline in our labor force of nearly 70,000 Mississippians since 2010,” he continued. “These numbers are not encouraging — but the untapped potential that we have in Mississippi is incredible.”</p>

<p>Having worked in the hyper-partisan Mississippi Legislature may have conditioned Baria, the Democratic leader in the House, for the hyper-partisanship of Congress, said Rep. Sonya Williams-Barnes, the leader of the legislative black caucus.</p>

<p>Wiliams-Barnes said Baria works with the Republican majority while continuing to “represent our poor and underserved.”</p>

<p>“I see David work across party lines. I see him provide advice as well as camaraderie with those who are not on the same side of the aisle and work the process to benefit the people of the state,” William-Barnes said.</p>

<p>Baria also said Mississippi’s leaders have failed to respond to the phenomenon known as “brain drain” that occurs when talented people leave the state.</p>

<p>“Everybody talks about the brain drain and what it cost our state but our current leaders can’t find — and sometimes I don’t think they even want to look for — a solution to that problem. Meanwhile, we’re losing a generation of bright young entrepreneurs, doctors, computer scientists and future leaders because we have failed to create the kind of place here in Mississippi where they want to live,” Baria said.</p>

<p>Rep. David Baria announces his bid for the U.S. Senate.</p>

<p>Should he emerge from the Democratic primary, Baria would face a tough climb against a Republican opponent, whether it’s the incumbent, U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, or McDaniel. The most votes a Democrat has collected in a Senate race in the past decade was in 2008, when former governor Ronnie Musgrove won 45 percent of votes in an election where Barack Obama’s name was also on the ballot.</p>

<p>Even Baria’s longtime supporters recognize this challenge.</p>

<p>Madeleine and John Fulwiler, who attended the campaign event, pointed to the recent Alabama Senate race in which Democrat Doug Jones narrowly bested former state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore. In the weeks before that race, a number of news reports surfaced that Moore had assaulted women and dated underage girls.</p>

<p>“Yeah, we’re looking at that thinking that that happened there, however I don’t know that the Republican candidates are as bad as Roy Moore,” Madeleine Fulwiler said.</p>

<p>“I think if Chris McDaniel runs, the roaches will come out of the walls with regard to some of the issues that party is having to deal with, and I think David could take advantage of some of that,” John Fulwiler said.</p>

<p>He added: “I think for the candidates running on the Democratic side will help David to have competition so that he gets better name recognition in the northern part of the state.”</p>

<p>Baria is also running against a relatively good economy, including here in Mississippi, which has one of the highest levels of unemployment in the nation but is seeing the lowest unemployment rates in a generation, a fact the state’s Republican leadership points out frequently.</p>

<p>“With a U.S. Senate race, you have the platform to reach a lot of people and tell the truth about those numbers because as you know the governor spins those numbers because he wants to tell the story of his own success,” Baria told Mississippi Today.</p>

<p>“The truth is our unemployment rate is lower because we have many, many fewer people trying to get jobs in Mississippi. We have this brain drain. I will have a platform through this race, hopefully, to talk about the truth. If people see the facts and recognize the truth, we can make some changes so that maybe we can reverse some of these trends.”</p>

<p>The Starkville Board of Aldermen’s denial of a parade permit for Starkville Pride will be readdressed on Tuesday.</p>

<p>On Friday afternoon, Ward 2 Alderman Sandra Sistrunk told the Starkville Daily News that she asked for reconsideration of the special event request from the group supporting LGBT issues for a Pride Parade on March 24.</p>

<p>“I asked to have it put back on the agenda because we now know what a lawsuit against us looks like, and we have other additional information that needs to be considered in that vote,” Sistrunk told the newspaper.</p>

<p>Starkville Pride filed a civil lawsuit in federal court on Feb. 26 against the city of Starkville after the Board of Aldermen voted 4-3 on Feb. 20 to deny group’s application for a parade permit and request for the city to provide in-kind services.</p>

<p>According to Tuesday’s agenda, the board plans to meet in executive session to discuss the litigation.</p>

<h2 id="stateprivateprisonsagainontrialinmississippi">State, private prisons again on trial in Mississippi</h2>

<p>The federal courthouse in Jackson</p>

<p>U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services</p>

<p>For the second time in less than three years, the state of Mississippi is in federal court defending a lawsuit against one of its privately run prisons.</p>

<p>The trial begins Monday in the case of Dockery v. Hall about conditions at East Mississippi Correctional Facility. The 1,500-bed facility in Meridian is designated to house the most severely mentally ill prisoners in the state; approximately 80 percent of the prisoners there have been diagnosed with a mental illness.</p>

<p>The lawsuit was filed in May 2013 after a two-year investigation by civil-liberty advocacy groups. The case later was granted class-action status with more than 1,100 members.</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that the Mississippi Department of Corrections “has deliberately ignored or failed to remediate the life-threatening conditions that persist” at the prison, which is operated by a Centerville, Utah-based company — Management &amp; Training Corp., the third largest private corrections firm in the United States. Named as a defendant is Pelicia Hall, appointed commissioner of the Mississippi Department of Corrections in March after serving as interim commissioner for two months.</p>

<p>“Plaintiffs face a substantial risk of serious harm — including death — living in an extremely dangerous prison environment that is marked by understaffing and staff abdication of even minimal security functions, significant gang control, malfunctioning cell door locking mechanisms, and prevalently available weapons,” attorneys for the prisoners bringing the suit wrote in the original complaint.</p>

<p>Southern Poverty Law Center</p>

<p>Jody Owens II, managing attorney of the Mississippi Southern Poverty Law Center</p>

<p>Jody Owens, managing attorney for the Mississippi Southern Poverty Law Center, said the conditions that existed in the prison when his organization first filed the lawsuit, with the American Civil Liberties Union and private law firms, persist today.</p>

<p>“Prisons are large facilities and, particularly, private prisons have a pattern and practice of understaffing their prisons,” Owens said on a recent conference call with reporters.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Department of Corrections declined to comment for this story, saying the agency would present its case in court.</p>

<p>Issa Arnita, a spokesman for the private prison company — which is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit although its employees will testify during the trial — said he could not talk about specific allegations because of the ongoing court case.</p>

<p>“We can say — unequivocally — that the East Mississippi Correctional Facility is safe, secure, clean, and well run. From the warden on down, our staff are trained to treat the men in our care with dignity and respect. Our mission is to help these men make choices in prison and after they’re released that will lead to a new and successful life in society,” Arnita said in an emailed statement.</p>

<p>The statement also included information about staffing and security improvements made at East Mississippi Correctional Facility since 2012 such as installing a full-body scanner, motion sensors and upgraded fencing. In addition, the company has enhanced training for all staff members and added additional staff in some areas.</p>

<p>MDOC</p>

<p>Attorneys paint a picture of life in the prison that is much more grim.</p>

<p>Owens points to four deaths that have occurred at the prison since the beginning of 2018, two of which he says were caused by overdose of a synthetic marijuana called spice and one because a prisoner choked in the dining hall.</p>

<p>“They do not have enough officers (and) people are literally selling their food to avoid fights,” he said.</p>

<p>Eric Balaban, senior staff attorney with the ACLU National Prison Project, said even though the prison has a large population of seriously mentally ill prisoners “the most basic elements of a mental health care system are absent.”</p>

<p>“As a result, very seriously mentally ill men who are warehoused at this facility unnecessarily suffer. They grow more ill, they grow more psychotic, they grow more isolated,” Balaban said.</p>

<p>Mississippi contracts with Centurion of Mississippi LLC, a division of St. Louis-based Centene Corp., to provide medical services at all of its facilities. The three-year contract is worth $150 million, state records show.</p>

<p>Erin Monju, with Washington-D.C. based law firm Covington &amp; Burling, noted that three different companies have provided medical services at the prison since 2011, all of which she said have been “grossly inadequate”</p>

<p>“It is MDOC’s obligation to ensure that state prisoners receive adequate health care. It is also MDOC’s responsibility to ensure that their contractors abide by the contract paid for and abide by the terms of the contract,” she said.</p>

<p>“These contractors have received multi-million dollar contract from Mississippi but Mississippi isn’t receiving the services it paid for,” Monju added. “No one at MDOC is holding these contractors to account.”</p>

<p>The lawsuit comes three years after prisoner-rights attorneys argued in federal court to leave in place a settlement at Walnut Grove Correctional Facility in Leake County, also run by Management &amp; Training Corp.</p>

<p>After several days of hearings, the judge in that case ordered the prison to remain under federal consent decree. In 2016, Mississippi shuttered the facility as a prison but announced that it would explore other uses, including possibly to house mentally ill prisoners.</p>

<p>A legislative effort to broaden the definition of gangs and criminal gang activity appears to have failed for the second straight year.</p>

<p>After passing the Senate, the two House committees to which the bill was was referred declined to consider Senate Bill 2868, which would impose harsh penalties for adults who get kids involved in gangs.</p>

<p>The legislation sought to define gangs as three or more people with identifying colors, clothing and hand signs that engage in “criminal gang activity.”</p>

<p>Backers of the bill said it was a remedy for the state’s gang problem; opponents raised civil-liberties concerns and said it could lead to racial profile.</p>

<p>A companion House bill died earlier in the session amid intense debate.</p>

<h2 id="15weekabortionbanpassessenatecommittee">15-week abortion ban passes Senate committee</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Larrison Campbell</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-02-26</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/02/27/15-week-abortion-ban-passes-senate-committee/ </p>

<p>Mississippi is one step closer to having the most restrictive abortion policy in the country.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Senate Public Health Committee passed a bill that would ban abortions in the state after a woman’s 15th week of pregnancy. Current Mississippi law restricts abortion after 20 weeks gestation. This bill essentially moves that timeline up by five weeks, according to Sen. Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall, who presented the bill to the committee.</p>

<p>Sen. Joey Fillingane, R-Sumrall, right</p>

<p>“The United States Supreme Court … has indicated that the state has a couple of interests when it comes to regulating abortion,” Fillingane said to Mississippi Today after the bill passed. “One is protecting the health and life of the mother. Another is protecting the potentiality of human life.”</p>

<p>This bill, like Mississippi’s current abortion law, makes some exceptions, allowing abortions after 15 weeks if the pregnancy threatens the life or health of the mother or if a doctor diagnoses a severe fetal abnormality. Like current law, Mississippi’s 15-week ban does not make exceptions for victims of rape and incest.</p>

<p>In his presentation of the bill, Fillingane said women who had been raped or been the victims of incest rarely needed those protections.</p>

<p>“Of course you don’t need it in most of those cases when rape and incest are involved. Those cases happen very quickly,” Fillingane said.</p>

<p>When asked to elaborate, Fillingane said he meant that these victims often sought abortions more quickly than people who became pregnant through consensual sex because “you know immediately that you have been the victim of rape or incest.”</p>

<p>But abortion rights advocates say the opposite is true.</p>

<p>“Those who have suffered at the hands of abusers may actually need additional grace,” said Felicia Brown Williams, director of public policy for Planned Parenthood Southeast, arguing that victims of rape and incest often take longer to report the incidents.</p>

<p>Fillingane said he had yet to see that evidence, but this dispute highlights the biggest concern abortion rights advocates have with the bill, that shortening the legal window for abortions would make abortion access next to impossible for many people in the state, particularly in Mississippi’s many rural areas. Mississippi currently has one clinic that provides abortions, and it in Jackson. The state also requires women to submit to a waiting period of at least 24 hours between their first appointment and the procedure.</p>

<p>“When you have a system where there are already restrictions based on having just one provider and you then decrease the amount of time when you have access, there is a substantive impact on the access that women coming from rural communities have,” Williams said.</p>

<p>Abortion policy exists in a sort of a limbo across the country, with recent court decisions gingerly straddling the line between preserving the life of viable fetuses and not overly restricting access for women who need the procedure. A handful of other states have also passed 20-week bans, but so far no state has approved a more restrictive policy. Abortion rights advocates have chosen not to challenge any of the 20 week bans in court.</p>

<p>Due to advances in medical technology, Fillingane says, 20 weeks is generally seen as the earliest point of viability for a fetus. In the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, the Supreme Court held that abortion should be legal until a fetus was viable.</p>

<p>But Fillingane added that, while no fetus has survived outside the womb before 15 weeks, the possibility doesn’t seem as far-fetched as it once did.</p>

<p>“Abortion is one of the areas where technology is really driving the debate. Of course religion is important and driving it, too. But I think technology has pushed the timeline further and further (up),” Fillingane said.</p>

<p>Ron Matis, chairman of the Mississippi Advisory Council on Faith-based Initiatives, said he agreed with Fillingane’s assessment that science is now driving a debate that has long found some of its strongest support in communities of faith.</p>

<p>“I’m glad to see the science community validating the thoughts that faith has on protecting human life,” Matis said.</p>

<p>If the ban passes in Mississippi, a legal challenge would be likely, Fillingane acknowledged, but he’s optimistic the law could withstand it.</p>

<p>“Assuming this bill were to become law, these challenges take two to three years to make their way up to the Supreme Court,” Fillingane said. “Who knows how far down the road technology would find us?”</p>

<p>Roll call was not taken after the vote, but the votes against the bill were a low murmur compared to those in favor of it. Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves praised the committee’s action Tuesday in a release that implied he would support the bill on the Senate floor.</p>

<p>“I am committed to making Mississippi the safest place in America for an unborn child,” Reeves said, in an echo of Gov. Phil Bryant’s comments after the bill passed out of the House earlier this month.</p>

<p>The W.K. Kellogg Foundation will provide a $3 million grant for its work with the Jackson Public School District.</p>

<p>The Community Foundation of Mississippi will apply those funds over an 18-month period toward administrative support for the Better Together Commission, as well as supporting “robust communications and community engagement,” according to a release. The funds will not go to the school district directly.</p>

<p>“The nature of the work the commission is tasked with requires intentional and intensive relationship building and collaboration, and we are excited about the opportunity to bring our experience serving the community and connecting people to do good work,” said Community Foundation president and CEO Jane Alexander.</p>

<p>The 15-member Better Together Commission was announced in October 2017 as an alternative to state takeover for the school district. Gov. Phil Bryant, the City of Jackson and the Michigan-based W.K. Kellogg Foundation each appointed five members to the commission, and Kellogg will bear the cost of the evaluation.</p>

<p>Members are tasked with engaging the community and hiring an outside entity to conduct an evaluation of the district. The commission recently selected California-based consultant Insight Education Group to do the study and present the findings in November.</p>

<p>The next Better Together meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday, March 1 at the Margaret Walker Alexander Library in Jackson.</p>

<h2 id="starkvillepridemarchesintocourtoverparadepermit">Starkville Pride marches into court over parade permit</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Larrison Campbell</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-02-25</p>

<p>For the fourth time in as many years, a Mississippi government body is going to court over gay rights issues.</p>

<p>On Monday, Starkville Pride, a Mississippi gay, lesbian, transgender and queer community organization, sued the city of Starkville in U.S. District Court over the board of aldermen’s rejection last week of the group’s application for a gay pride parade.</p>

<p>The four aldermen who voted against granting the permit offered no explanation at the time and have not answered multiple requests for comment from Mississippi Today. Three members of the board voted in favor of the permit and have indicated that the application “checked all the right boxes.” As a result, the lawsuit alleges that the board’s denial is discriminatory and, therefore, unconstitutional.</p>

<p>“Based solely on the content of their speech, specifically the fact that they take pride in being gay, these students are being denied their right to speak in a public forum,” said Robbie Kaplan, the attorney representing Starkville Pride. “We are confident that the federal court will reverse this unconstitutional action and allow the parade to proceed as planned.”</p>

<p>Bailey McDaniel, 22, an organizer with Starkville Pride, an LGBT support group that was denied a permit to hold the city’s first gay pride parade.</p>

<p>Members of Starkville Pride have said that the board’s decision to reject their application came as a surprise. Rejections for permit applications are unusual. The board has approved every similar application filed between 2014 and 2018, according to the lawsuit.</p>

<p>“We wanted to have a day of celebration and inclusiveness,” said Bailey McDaniel, president of Starkville Pride. “Without explanation or warning, a whole community of people have been denied their constitutional rights. We would like to believe that this type of hateful, intolerant behavior does not represent the Starkville community and we hope that the decision will be reversed.”</p>

<p>Still, many members of Starkville city government said they weren’t surprised by the outcome. In 2014, Starkville became the first town in Mississippi to pass an anti-discrimination resolution that included sexual orientation and identity and later added a policy that extended health benefits to domestic partners of city employees.</p>

<p>But months later, the city quietly repealed both policies under pressure from local religious leaders, according to members of the board of aldermen who supported the Pride parade.</p>

<p>“I would say it’s unfortunate but, no, it wasn’t surprising,” said Jason Walker, an alderman in Starkville’s Ward 4. “In the previous term (the anti-discrimination resolution) became a highly debated and controversial vote and was ultimately repealed. And those same individuals were re-elected, and their opinion didn’t seem to change.”</p>

<p>Previous federal court battles over alleged gay rights violations in Mississippi include the 2015 federal appeals court decision to overturn the state’s ban on gay marriage. And in 2016, a U.S. District Court Judge overturned the state’s ban on gay and lesbian parents adopting children.</p>

<p>Several months after that, Gov. Phil Bryant signed a law that singled out three “sincerely held” religious beliefs as worthy of protection: that marriage is between one man and one woman; that people should not have sex outside such marriages; and that a person’s gender is set at birth. The law protects from prosecution a person who refuses service to someone if they feel doing so would violate those beliefs.</p>

<p>Public outcry was swift as were the federal lawsuits. Although a U.S. District Court judge agreed the law was unconstitutional, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately overturned that ruling on the grounds that the plaintiffs did not have standing because the law had not yet taken effect.</p>

<p>Kaplan, the attorney for Starkville Pride, represented plaintiffs in each of the above cases.</p>

<p>While Starkville Pride’s Bailey McDaniel may have been caught off guard by the outcome, supporters of the event arrived prepared for a battle. At the meeting on Tuesday evening, 14 Starkville residents, from all corners of the community, spoke in support of the parade. Two spoke against it.</p>

<p>After the vote, Mayor Lynn Spruill publicly expressed disappointment, arguing it would reflect badly on Starkville.</p>

<p>“I had hoped it would go differently. I’ve been extremely supportive of special events. In my opinion the more the merrier,” Spruill told Mississippi Today on Thursday. “I do not think the denial represents the community. I think the community is much more inclusive and diverse than this vote represents.”</p>

<p>What Spruill and some of the aldermen said was less surprising were rumors of a lawsuit, which had begun swirling shortly after news of the board’s rejection broke. At the beginning of last Tuesday’s meeting, the board held an executive session to discuss potential legal action.</p>

<p>“If you ask a given number of attorneys, most would tell you you don’t have much legal standing for denying (the parade). And I say that with the benefit of hindsight,” said Sandra Sistrunk, an alderman for Ward 2, who is in favor of a Pride parade.</p>

<p>Roy Harness always has considered himself to be innovative.</p>

<p>In 1986, those traits resulted in a conviction for forging checks, for which he served a two-year sentence. Today, Harness uses those qualities in the hope of finding young people dealing with issues he faced (addiction, homelessness) and steering them away from the decisions he made more than 30 years ago.</p>

<p>Jackson State University</p>

<p>Roy Harness after receiving his bachelor’s degree in social work from Jackson State University.</p>

<p>Harness said people who knew him were surprised to learn about the lengths he went to feed his addiction.</p>

<p>“On drugs and alcohol, you can get pretty creative,” said the McComb native, who is now working towards a master’s degree in social work at Jackson State University.</p>

<p>Despite turning his life around, Harness feels unfulfilled in one important way.</p>

<p>Under Mississippi law, forgery is one of the felonies that removes a convicted person’s right to vote. Harness is a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging the rule, arguing that it disproportionately disqualifies African-American voters and echoes past voter-suppression policies such as poll taxes and literacy tests.</p>

<p>“It’s the same soup, just warmed up in a different bowl,” said Harness, 62.</p>

<p>Attorneys for Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann, the defendant in the suit, deny all the claims. The office for Attorney General Jim Hood, which represents Hosemann, said it cannot comment on pending cases.</p>

<p>Conviction data shows that the disqualification laws disproportionately impact black felons. Advocates for reform say the data underscore the need for legislation currently pending that requires the Legislature to closely examine the state’s felon disenfranchisement and the disproportionate effect those laws have on African Americans.</p>

<p>According to a Mississippi Today analysis — looking at conviction records from the Administrative Office of Courts that span from 1994 until last November — 56,255 Mississippians have lost the right to vote in that time due to felony charges.</p>

<p>Sixty-one percent of those who have lost their right to vote are African-American, despite the fact that African Americans represent 36 percent of the state’s total voting-age population.</p>

<p>Harness doesn’t see why his past conviction should still prevent him and others from voting if they have completed their sentences and repaid their debts to society.</p>

<p>“If you served your time for the crime, lived a productive life, I don’t see any reason why a person shouldn’t get their voting rights back,” he said. “Why do you want to keep punishing a person for something they did (more than 30) years ago? People make mistakes. Don’t keep punishing people for things they did when they were young or their head wasn’t right.”</p>

<p>The laws at the heart of Harness’s lawsuit can be traced back nearly 130 years.</p>

<p>Harness, through attorneys, argued in the lawsuit that the framers of the state constitution, which governs Mississippi today, believed that several crimes were more likely to be committed by African Americans and were therefore were an avenue for disenfranchisement of black voters.</p>

<p>The disqualifying felonies that still exist from the Mississippi Constitution of 1890 are bribery, theft, arson, obtaining money or goods under false pretenses, perjury, forgery and embezzlement, all of which the lawsuit seeks to remove. Murder and rape were added in 1968, but Harness’s lawsuit is not challenging those. Other felonies, such as child pornography and drug trafficking, are not disqualifying.</p>

<p>In 1896, the Mississippi Supreme Court wrote, “Restrained by the federal constitution from discriminating against the negro race, the convention discriminated against its characteristics and the offenses to which its weaker members were prone” by choosing those felonies.</p>

<p>Mississippi Today’s analysis is bolstered by a recent study published by The Sentencing Project, One Voice and the Mississippi NAACP showing that nearly one in 10 of all Mississippians are disenfranchised (second to only Florida). However, 16 percent of the state’s black population is prohibited from voting because of a felony.</p>

<p>Almost every state disqualifies felons from voting for at least the person’s time in prison; Mississippi, though, is one of only 12 states that withhold voting rights from a felon after they’ve served their sentence and completed probation. Research shows such a prohibition can suppress African American voting.</p>

<p>In states with lifetime bans, black voters are 12 percent less likely to cast ballots, while white voters are only one percent less likely, according to a 2009 study from the Social Science Quarterly. Of the 6.1 million disenfranchised Americans, more than three-quarters are not incarcerated, having successfully completed their sentences, The Sentencing Project found.</p>

<p>Dr. Corey Wiggins, executive director of the Mississippi NAACP, said that the number of disqualified voters is a concern for the state, particularly for its black community.</p>

<p>“When you start to trace the history of these laws that have been in place and that are disenfranchising the vote, you see this track record of laws that tend to be targeted specifically towards African Americans,” he told Mississippi Today.</p>

<p>“It’s an issue considering that there are over 200,000 Mississippians who are currently (disenfranchised),” Wiggins said, “and it’s a hard process to restore those rights.”</p>

<p>Disqualified voters can restore their rights through legislation, commonly called a suffrage bill, or through a governor’s pardon. But only 156 (less than 1 percent of the total disqualified pool) since 1997 have succeeded through legislation, according to the Legislature’s records. Then, after Gov. Haley Barbour’s pardons of almost 200 people stirred controversy and prompted a legal challenge, Gov. Phil Bryant stated in 2012 that he would only grant pardons to people who are wrongfully convicted.</p>

<p>Mississippi Today’s analysis shows that the top disqualifying crimes for disenfranchisement are property crimes, not violent offenses. Murder and rape together account for only 6 percent of all disqualifying crimes, data show.</p>

<p>As seen in the pie chart above, the felonies that most commonly disqualify Mississippians from voting are larceny, robbery, forgery, shoplifting and receiving stolen goods.</p>

<p>Black disqualified voters make up approximately half, if not more, of each of the top disqualifying felony convictions, as seen below.</p>

<p>Rob McDuff, the attorney handling the lawsuit with the Mississippi Center for Justice, said this data shows the unjust effect of the disqualifying laws.</p>

<p>“These statistics demonstrate that this racist provision from the 1890 Constitution continues to have a discriminatory impact,” McDuff said. “It is a clear violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and we are asking the federal court to strike it down.”</p>

<p>If successful, the lawsuit could restore voting rights to at least 52,599 people (the previous total minus murder and rape cases), although it is unknown how many of those are still alive and would vote in Mississippi.</p>

<p>Legislation that is currently the subject of debate could be the first step in examining how the state restores those rights.</p>

<p>House Bill 774, introduced by Rep. Bill Denny, R-Jackson, calls for a study on the impact of voter disqualification, specifically regarding nonviolent felons such as Roy Harness. The bill passed the House 114-7 and is now in the Senate.</p>

<p>Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson, vice chairman of the Senate Elections Committee, said that felons should be disqualified but that there should be a better process for restoring voting rights.</p>

<p>“I believe that Mississippi needs a process where by people who have lost the right to vote can regain the right after they have paid their debt to society,” he said. “I believe that people convicted of a felony should lose their right to vote during the time they are incarcerated and until they have completed all the terms of their punishment, including probation.</p>

<p>Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson</p>

<p>“I hope we can address this issue during this session,” Blount said.</p>

<p>Blount represents Hinds County, the state’s most populous and the county with the most disqualified voters with 4,674.</p>

<p>Below is a map of voters disqualified due to felony charges in each county according to data from the Administrative Office of Courts. The counties with the highest rates of disqualified voters per 1,000 residents are Pike (24), Tunica (23), Grenada (22), Panola (20), Coahoma (20) and Humphreys (20).</p>

<p>Harness has never voted in his life. He believes that in addition to voting being his right as an American citizen, he wants to use his vote to voice his opposition to state and federal policy proposals, especially regarding health care and immigration.</p>

<p>“This country is built on immigrants,” he said. “A lot of people get comfy in this country and won’t take low-wage jobs. Immigrants need the opportunity to better themselves as well as people in the United States. I don’t see a problem with it. Like Martin Luther King (Jr.) said, we came on different ships, but we’re all in the same boat now.”</p>

<p>Everyone wanted to talk to Nick Sandlin after his performance against State Friday night at Pete Taylor Park.</p>

<p>HATTIESBURG — It was a new season and a new role for Southern Miss junior pitcher Nick Sandlin, who made his first collegiate start after two seasons as one of the most dependable closers in college baseball.</p>

<p>Sandlin was remarkable in his new role, and his teammates gave him plenty of support in an 11-0 victory over Mississippi State before a capacity crowd of 4,948 at Pete Taylor Park.</p>

<p>Mississippi State coach Andy Cannizaro may have put it best: “Sandlin was phenomenal. He was the best player on the field tonight.”</p>

<p>He was that, going seven innings, allowing just four hits and striking out nine Bulldogs. He needed 93 pitches to complete his longest outing since high school.</p>

<p>“I wanted to start and it felt good,” Sandlin said. “But you’re not going to lose many games when your teammates get you 11 runs.”</p>

<p>That’s a nice, humble thing to say, but you should know that this was a scoreless game through three innings and USM led by 4-0 after six. State’s Konnor Pilkington, a projected first-round MLB draft choice, was lights-out early, leaving Sandlin little room for error. Sandlin was up to the task – and then some.</p>

<p>And it didn’t surprise State standout Jake Mangum, who was a teammate of Sandlin’s last summer in the Cape Cod League.</p>

<p>“Mentally, Nick’s so strong,” Mangum said. “He doesn’t back down from any situation. I mean, he’s really tough, and he throws three pitches for strikes from a lot of different arm slots and he was hitting 93 (mph) on the gun. He’s outstanding. He beat us tonight.”</p>

<p>No telling what the score might have been had it not been for Mangum, who made three outstanding, run-saving catches. Mangum made a highlight-reel catch coming in for one ball, ran one down back to the wall for another, and then outran the ball to catch a long fly to right-center. He also had two of the Bulldogs’ six hits.</p>

<p>This was a rematch of the championship round of last season’s NCAA regional championship round when the Bulldogs swept two games in one day to end the Golden Eagles’ school-record 50-victory season.</p>

<p>It was USM coach Scott Berry’s 300th career victory, although he wasn’t around to see it. Berry is serving a two-game suspension resulting from an altercation with an umpire in the last game of last year’s regional. He watched the game on his computer in his office, just as he will the second game of the series on Saturday.</p>

<p>Asked if it was a strange way to get such a milestone win, Berry said, “Yes, it was. You know, I’ve never been in adult timeout before.”</p>

<p>Chad Caillet, Berry’s long-time assistant, handled the head coaching duties and was joined by pitching coach Christian Ostrander, making his USM debut after coming over from Conference USA rival Louisiana Tech.</p>

<p>Of Sandlin’s first start, Ostrander said, “Hey, it’s just what we’ve been seeing him do for weeks in practice. The decision to start him was not that difficult – at least not as hard as a lot of people are making it out to be. The guy can just flat pitch.”</p>

<p>And if the first game is any indication, USM can hit. Luke Reynolds, a transfer from State, was impressive in his USM debut with a double, a single and two RBIs. Matt Guidry slugged a home run and narrowly missed two others. Catcher Cole Donaldson added two more hits, as did shortstop LeeMarcus Boyd. Guidry bats eighth in the order, Boyd ninth. Not many college teams will have so much pop that late in the order.</p>

<p>“They are a veteran team – big, strong and physical,” Cannizaro said. “But this is just one game. It has no bearing whatsoever about what happens tomorrow or Sunday. That’s the great thing about baseball.”</p>

<h2 id="mcdanielstillcoyaboutsenaterunwithonemonthtilldeadline">McDaniel still coy about Senate run with one month till deadline</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Ganucheau</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-02-01</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/02/02/mcdaniel-still-coy-senate-run-one-month-till-deadline/ </p>

<p>Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Ellisville, speaks during Mississippi Senate floor debate.</p>

<p>The only deadline that matters as to whether anti-establishment conservative Sen. Chris McDaniel will run for U.S. Senate is one month from today — March 1.</p>

<p>Supporters, political observers, even reporters have seen several of McDaniel’s self-imposed deadlines for a decision pass with no decision from him:</p>

<p>• First it was fall of 2017.</p>

<p>• Next it was the end of October.</p>

<p>• Then it was “sometime in January.”</p>

<p>Now McDaniel isn’t giving a timeline. Four weeks from the March 2 qualifying deadline for the seat, he isn’t tipping his hand.</p>

<p>“I know that to a lot of people these days it sounds strange, almost unbelievable, almost supernatural, but God can bring peace to a heart,” McDaniel said. “It may hit me tonight, or tomorrow morning, and when I feel it, I’ll make that announcement fast and then we’ll be moving.</p>

<p>“I’m waiting for that light bulb to go off,” he said.</p>

<p>A pro-McDaniel super PAC — Remember Mississippi PAC — raised more than $1 million in 2017, according to a year-end report filed with the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday. Two out-of-state donors represented the bulk of that fundraising —$1 million, FEC records show. Remember Mississippi currently has approximately $1.2 million cash on hand.</p>

<p>Leaders of the PAC urged McDaniel to run in a Wednesday press release, stating “Mississippians’ voices have been silenced for too long, their values ignored, and their will trampled.”</p>

<p>McDaniel told Mississippi Today on Wednesday that the PAC’s fundraising efforts made him feel “incredibly blessed.”</p>

<p>Also on Wednesday, Sen. Roger Wicker’s campaign filed its year-end report with the FEC, reporting just under $1 million raised in the final three months of 2017, bringing the campaign’s cash on hand to $4.1 million.</p>

<p>“I want to continue working with President Trump to grow our economy, secure our borders, and keep Americans safe,” Wicker said in a news release. “Our campaign will continue the hard work to organize volunteers in all 82 Mississippi counties and earn the trust and support of voters in the Republican primary and general election this year.”</p>

<p>McDaniel faces several options for future office, the most pressing decision being whether to run for Wicker’s seat. He has also considered a 2019 run for lieutenant governor.</p>

<p>Bill Clark, CQ Roll Call via AP</p>

<p>Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., leaves the Senate Republicans’ policy lunch in the Capitol on Oct. 24.</p>

<p>Many politicos expect Sen. Thad Cochran, the longtime senior senator, to step down sometime this year, and McDaniel has expressed interest in running for that seat. That vacancy would put into motion a November special election with no primary.</p>

<p>“It seems time is more on our side that against us,” McDaniel said. “So we lean back, take our time, keep working, I’m speaking two nights a week. I don’t quite have that perfect understanding that I need to jump in one of the three races. The day it hits me, the day that light goes off, it’ll be an easy decision.”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to make sure we get the biggest bang for the buck, and that whatever we run for, all of us together, that we change the country,” he continued. “And that might be running for lieutenant governor.”</p>

<p>McDaniel first rose to political prominence in 2014, when he staged a nearly successful upset of Cochran. He earned more votes than Cochran in the primary, but Cochran received more votes in a runoff three weeks later.</p>

<p>He then spent weeks refusing to concede the race and challenging the results in court. For months now, McDaniel has been touring the state and maintaining much of that 2014 base through provocative social media posts.</p>

<p>“We’ve tried it Roger Wicker’s way for 100 years,” McDaniel said. “We’ve always utilized our seniority to draw down federal funds, and for 100 years we’ve remained dead last following their playbook.”</p>

<p>“Our suggestion is it’s time to give someone else a shot,” he continued. “And it may not be me, but some likeminded individual who’s going to be beholden to the people of MS than any of the lobbyists, the cronies, and the insiders in Washington. That’s one of the things our base sees and is frustrated about.”</p>

<p>The pro-McDaniel PAC pulled in $500,000 donations each from Robert Mercer and Dick Uihlein, two out-of-state mega donors who helped financed President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.</p>

<p>Uihlein also funded much of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore’s campaign. Moore, facing several allegations of sexual harassment and assault, lost to Democrat Doug Jones in a December special election.</p>

<p>Former White House strategist Steve Bannon speaks at a rally for U.S. Senate hopeful Roy Moore last year in Fairhope, Ala.</p>

<p>Mercer most recently made national headlines after publicly cutting ties with Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist. Bannon, who has publicly supported McDaniel and pushed McDaniel to run against Wicker, was quoted in a newly released book calling the a meeting between Trump campaign leaders and Russian officials “treasonous” and “unpatriotic.”</p>

<p>In the interview on Wednesday, McDaniel distanced himself from Bannon and played up his own relationship with the Mercer family, saying “they’re going to be with me because they’re my friends and they believe in the things I believe in.”</p>

<p>“It’s very clear that I’m not a Bannon candidate,” McDaniel said. “I was running for office against the establishment when Bannon was starting with Breitbart. We predated Trump in that respect. We predated Bannon in that respect. Because of that, we don’t feel like the association, however loosely configured, can hurt us because people understand that we were doing this well before Bannon came on the scene.”</p>

<h2 id="topissuesstillupfordebateafterdeadlineday">Top issues still up for debate after deadline day</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Ganucheau</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-29</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/30/top-issues-still-debate-deadline-day/ </p>

<p>Bills that survived Tuesday’s first major legislative deadlines will set the tone and highlight the major themes for the rest of this year’s session.</p>

<p>Speaker Philip Gunn made his mark during the session’s first two weeks, shepherding through the House an ambitious rewrite of the public school funding formula and several new ways to pay for infrastructure maintenance.</p>

<p>Other key topics have emerged that Capitol observers are sure to watch closely as they spark debate on the House and Senate floors. Here is a look at some of the key issues yet to be resolved:</p>

<p>Education </p>

<p>Early in the session, the House rushed out a 354-page bill that would rewrite the state’s education formula. Gunn lauded the legislation as a joint effort between the House and Senate, but Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves has yet to address the issue. When asked by Mississippi Today, his spokesperson Laura Hipp said Reeves is “committed to implementing student-centered funding for Mississippi schools that better addresses the needs of the classrooms of today.”</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves</p>

<p>The House sent its bill to the Senate on Jan. 18, but Reeves still has not assigned it to a committee. The Senate did not produce its own education funding bill ahead of the committee deadline, so the question of what will happen to school funding in Mississippi this year remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a bill that would greatly expand the state’s current education scholarship account program survived in the Senate.</p>

<p>Senate Education Committee Chairman Gray Tollison, R-Oxford, author of the bill, told committee members the time to act is now to bring Mississippi out of last place in education, and school choice is a viable way to do so.</p>

<p>Senate Bill 2623 would make all students who attended public schools the previous year eligible for the accounts. Students whose parents are in the military and students in the foster car system or adopted from that system would not need to meet that requirement. Students with special needs and low-income students would receive priority for the accounts.</p>

<p>Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson, spoke against the bill, pointing out that after full implementation it could cost the state around $140 million in funds going from public schools to private schools and other educational services. The bill would cap participation to one-half of a percent of public school enrollment the first year, or 2,400 students, then add more students in each subsequent year.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe we’re about to do something of this importance with so little thought and so little discussion,” Blount said.</p>

<p>In a statement, Reeves said the bill “could have more impact on long-term economic progress than any other bill debated in the Legislature.”</p>

<p>“We have a long way to go to secure enough votes in the House of Representatives, but today’s action moves us one step closer to making this a reality,” he said.</p>

<p>House Education Committee Chairman Richard Bennett, R-Long Beach, killed a similar House bill Tuesday.</p>

<p>Roads </p>

<p>A handful of road funding bills passed out of the House in the first weeks of the session, most notably an infrastructure bill that would pull $108 million from the state budget and divert it to road and bridge funding around the state. Like the House education bill, it has yet to be assigned to a Senate committee by Reeves.</p>

<p>Infrastructure funding was an another early focus of Gunn’s. A bill that would divert $108 million in general fund dollars mainly to cities and counties for road and bridge repair was passed by the House in just the second week of the session. Determining where to find that cash in the general fund will almost certainly prove difficult. Reeves has spoken against what he calls temporary fixes to the long term infrastructure problem.</p>

<p>Health care </p>

<p>Because the laws governing the Division of Medicaid expire at the end of this fiscal year, the Medicaid technical bills, which reauthorize the agency, have dominated healthcare conversation at the Capitol. Senate and House bills on this issue have each made it out of committee.</p>

<p>Gil Ford Photography</p>

<p>The Senate bill, sponsored by Medicaid Committee Chair Brice Wiggins, R-Pascagoula, doesn’t make dramatic changes to the law. One provision would “standardize” the pre-authorization process Medicaid uses to approve patient procedures.</p>

<p>Other changes, such as providing certain medicines and increasing allowed doctor visits, were recommendations from the Medical Care Advisory Committee, intended to encourage investing in preventative care. The idea is that spending money on less expensive procedures upfront ultimately keeps patients from needing big ticket procedures like inpatient hospital stays and temergency room visits.</p>

<p>The initial draft of the bill had included several items intended to “control costs,” according to Wiggins. The most controversial of these was one that would have allowed the Division of Medicaid and the state’s managed care companies to cut the rates they pay healthcare providers for services. Wiggins said “provider feedback” pushed him to remove it.</p>

<p>One of the most controversial issues this session has been Child Protection Services, which announced a whopping $38 million deficit earlier this month. Since then the agency has worked with the Department of Human Services, reducing their request to $12 million. But legislators have said they’re still unclear about where to find the money.</p>

<p>Legislators have admitted their role in the deficit, saying they didn’t realize that moving Child Protection Services out from under the Department of Human Services in 2016 would drastically reduce the amount of federal funding they received. House Bill 1171, sponsored by Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, would turn Child Protection Services into a subagency of DHS in the hopes of avoiding a similar crisis in future budget years.</p>

<p>The decision last year to cap spending on the Department of Mental Health’s disability waiver program led to what legislators called an “unintended consequence” of freezing enrollment to the program since July 1. House Bill 1234, sponsored by House Appropriations Chair John Read, R-Gautier, would roll back that spending cap.</p>

<p>Criminal Justice </p>

<p>Unlike previous years, where leaders put criminal-justice issues high on their list of priorities, several law-and-order bills have quietly made it to the forefront.</p>

<p>The House previously passed a bill that would define gangs and stiffen penalties for “criminal gang activity.”</p>

<p>On the committee deadline day, the House Corrections Committee passed a half-dozen bills, including two that would crackdown on the use of cell phones in state prisons. One would enhance penalties for correctional officers found guilty of smuggling drugs into prisons. Another, HB 1124 would make it a felony to talk to a prisoner on a cellphone, which are considered contraband.</p>

<p>Rep. Bill Kinkade, R-Byhalia, chairman of the Corrections Committee, called the presence of cellphones “one of the biggest nemeses we have have,” because the phones have been used to plan crimes, including murder and extortion.</p>

<p>Kinkade cited Mississippi Department of Corrections statistics that the agency recovered 2,700 cell phones in 2017. MDOC house about 24,000 inmates.</p>

<p>Gil Ford PHotography</p>

<p>Rep. Joel Bomgar</p>

<p>At least three committee members voted against the bill, which they believed could have unintended consequences for family members and possibly lawmakers and others who receive phone calls from incarcerated people.</p>

<p>“Due to the high cost of collect calls, a lot of mamas are not going to be able to resist talking to their child in prison and they’re not plotting gang activity and they’re not smuggling drugs and flying drones,” said Rep. Joel Bomgar, R-Madison.</p>

<p>Another bill the committee sent to the full House would prohibit the use of unmanned aircraft, commonly known as drones, near prisons.</p>

<p>BP funding</p>

<p>A battle is brewing again this year among lawmakers regarding how to spend millions in BP oil spill settlement money. BP, the multinational oil and gas company, agreed to pay Mississippi $750 million for damages related to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill which impacted the entire Gulf Coast region.</p>

<p>The first portion of BP’s $750 million settlement – $150 million – arrived in July 2016. But lawmakers in March 2016, while crafting the current fiscal year’s budget, had already earmarked $41 million of that check for specific projects within the coastal counties.The remaining $109.6 million is currently sitting in the state treasury. Starting in 2019, the state will receive payments of $40 million a year until 2033.</p>

<p>Gulf Coast delegates, regardless of party affiliation, have ardently lobbied to keep the majority of the money in the three coastal counties. Others across the state see the money as a much-needed revenue gift for infrastructure improvements or other budgetary needs.</p>

<p>The Senate this month passed a bill that would, in theory, handle how millions in BP settlement funds can be spent. The bill would place the BP money into a separate fund that could be drawn upon “for projects benefiting the Gulf Coast.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the House, which killed that same Senate bill last year, passed several measures this month that would dictate how BP settlement money can be spent. The House Appropriations committee passed two bills Tuesday that would split up the settlement money into 10 developmental districts along the Gulf Coast.</p>

<p>Representatives from those districts would then distribute money through a grant application process for projects that “will have a significant impact on the tax base,” workforce development projects, and infrastructure improvement projects.</p>

<h2 id="jacksonstandsuptojusticedeptdefendsantiracialprofilingordinance">Jackson stands up to Justice Dept., defends anti-racial profiling ordinance</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Kendra Ablaza</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/30/jackson-stands-justice-department-defends-anti-racial-profiling-ordinance/ </p>

<p>City of Jackson</p>

<p>Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba says the city is in compliance with the Department of Justice on the issue of sanctuary cities and expects to satisfactorily resolve questions posed by federal officials who threaten to pull funding from municipalities that the Trump Administration believes are impeding enforcement of immigration laws.</p>

<p>“In fact, the City of Jackson’s Ordinance explains in great detail the spirit in</p>

<p>which it was created: to protect everyone in Jackson whether legal or undocumented,” Lumumba said in a statement dated Monday. “Meaning our</p>

<p>police officers will investigate, but also protect the rights of all individuals in our great City.”</p>

<p>Lumumba’s statement came almost one week after the U.S. Department of Justice sent a second round of notices to Jackson and 22 other cities, counties and states. The department is demanding documents from these local and state governments that could reveal if they are refusing to share information with the department and other federal immigration agencies.</p>

<p>The department also said it would subpoena those documents if these cities, counties and states do not respond by Feb. 23.</p>

<p>Lumumba this week said the city’s anti-racial profiling ordinance is not in violation of national law, echoing the same sentiment he shared in November when the Justice Department first threatened it would to cut law enforcement funding in Jackson and 28 other cities, counties and states over adopted policies they say may disregard federal immigration law, also known as “sanctuaries” from immigration.</p>

<p>Jackson’s 2010 anti-racial profiling ordinance, which prohibits police officers from asking about suspects’ immigration status during routine traffic stops, has also drawn scrutiny from state leaders who say undocumented immigrants are a costly burden to taxpayers. Gov. Phil Bryant acknowledged the ordinance before signing an anti-sanctuary cities bill into law last March.</p>

<p>The law, then known as Senate Bill 2710, took effect immediately by voiding policies that municipalities, counties and agencies may adopt to limit or prohibit any person from communicating or cooperating with federal agencies to verify or report the immigration status of any person.</p>

<p>The law also voids any policies that grant a person lawful presence or status within the state, whether that is in a county or city, or a university, college, community college or junior college.</p>

<p>Bryant signed the law on the same day U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Trump administration would withhold federal criminal justice grants from cities, counties and states that do not fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities.</p>

<p>The order became the subject of a federal court challenge in California, which is pending appeal.</p>

<p>The funding in question is the city’s fiscal year 2016 Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Program, or JAG, award, which allows states and units of local government to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime based on their own state and local needs and conditions, the Department of Justice website says. Mississippi received $1.8 million from the program in fiscal year 2017, records show.</p>

<h2 id="billwouldmakemississippithefirststatetobanabortionsafter15weeks">Bill would make Mississippi the first state to ban abortions after 15 weeks</h2>

<p id="byline">by: R.L. Nave</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-29</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/30/15-week-abortion-ban-passes-house-committee/ </p>

<p>A House committee moved Mississippi toward having one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation.</p>

<p>Google Streetview</p>

<p>The Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the state’s only remaining abortion clinic.</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon, the Judiciary B Committee passed HB 1510 — the Gestational Age Act — which would ban most abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. Mississippi would be the first state to enact such a law, although other states are considering similar legislation.</p>

<p>The bill defines gestation as “the time that has elapsed since the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period,” although there is significant debate over establishing legal definitions related to abortion.</p>

<p>“It is medically proven that these abortions performed after the first trimester are extremely dangerous to the mother’s health in addition to the fact that it forces a very late abortion in the process,” said Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, who chairs the Judiciary B committee.</p>

<p>Gipson, a pro-life Baptist pastor, did not cite medical research but noted that the Legislature passed a 20-week ban on abortions during the 2017 session with little controversy.</p>

<p>Felicia Brown-Williams, the Mississippi state director at Planned Parenthood Southeast, called the 15-week ban “unconstitutional.”</p>

<p>“At the end of the day, it’s bad policy,” Brown-Williams told Mississippi Today.</p>

<p>Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton</p>

<p>In June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court settled a four-year battle over another Mississippi abortion bill. That year, the nation’s highest court ruled that the state could not implement a law that would have required doctors at freestanding abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.</p>

<p>Gipson said he believes the 15-week ban would pass constitutional muster.</p>

<p>“The Supreme Court has recognized that states have an interest in protecting human life and that standard will continued to be upheld,” Gipson said.</p>

<p>Diane Derzis, who owns the Jackson Women’s Health Organization — the state’s only abortion clinic — said her clinic, which does abortions up to 16 weeks, would be affected if the bill becomes law.</p>

<p>Under current state law, women must have a counseling session and wait 24 hours before having an abortion. Derzis said most abortions occur in the first 12 weeks, adding that women who have abortions later in their pregnancies do so for health, economic or other reasons.</p>

<p>“When you’re talking 15 or 16 weeks, these are women and girls who delay finding out they’re pregnant (or) don’t realize they missed a period. They’re lower income. That’s why it affects those who are least able to afford it the most,” she said.</p>

<p>The bill now heads to the House for consideration. The Senate Public Health Committee did not consider a companion bill before a Tuesday deadline.</p>

<h2 id="billsaddingpenaltiesforcrimesbygangmembersmoveahead">Bills adding penalties for crimes by gang members move ahead</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Kayleigh Skinner</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-25</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/26/bills-adding-penalties-crimes-gang-members-move-ahead/ </p>

<p>An effort to broadly define gangs and impose extra penalties for crimes they commit was approved Friday for House debate. A similar bill was passed by a Senate committee on Thursday.</p>

<p>The House Judiciary B committee passed House Bill 541 Friday morning. Efforts to advance a similar bill last year died.</p>

<p>Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton</p>

<p>Described by Rep. Andy Gipson as possibly “one of the most significant pieces of legislation we pass this year in terms of public safety,” the Mississippi Anti-Gang Act defines what constitutes a gang and outlines specific penalties for criminal activity committed by members.</p>

<p>The bill defines a gang as three or more people who “collectively identify themselves by adopting a group identity” through a common name, hand sign or gesture, slogan or graffitti and participate in criminal gang activity. According to the bill, that includes any kind of crime in Mississippi.</p>

<p>If the crime committed as a gang member counts as a felony, punishment ranges from a five to 15-year imprisonment and a $10,000 to $15,000 fine in addition to the original sentence for the crime itself. Gang members receive up to five additional years to their sentence if the crime committed is a misdemeanor, according to the bill.</p>

<p>“What we lack in the state is a comprehensive piece of legislation that has crime specific to gang activity, and that’s what this bill does,” Gipson, a Republican from Braxton said. “Gang activity is any activity on the books that’s committed by a gang.”</p>

<p>In the meeting, Mississippi Department of Public Safety general counsel Lora Hunter described the results of a December 2017 “gang threat assessment” that polled 125 law enforcement agencies from every county in the state on the most prevalent gangs in each county.</p>

<p>Hunter said all but five counties reported the same three gangs as most prevalent —Gangster Disciples, Vice Lords, and the Simon City Royals.</p>

<p>Rep. Adrienne Wooten, D-Jackson asked Gipson why hate groups were not included in the legislation.</p>

<p>“There’s a reason for them being called hate groups and there is a reason for us calling activities that is committed by certain individuals gang-related activities,” Wooten said.</p>

<p>Gipson, who is chairman of the committee, said the language was purposefully broad.</p>

<p>“The definition of criminal gang activity under this bill is an act or acts that would constitute a criminal offense. That’s any criminal offense on the books, including hate crimes on the books,” he said.</p>

<h2 id="twowomenjointhegopfieldtorepresentmississippiincongress">Two women join the GOP field to represent Mississippi in Congress</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Ganucheau</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-21</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/22/doty-seeks-become-first-woman-represent-mississippi-congress/ </p>

<p>Sen. Sally Doty, R-Brookhaven</p>

<p>Sally Doty, a Republican state senator from Brookhaven, has officially joined the race to run for the U.S. House seat being vacated by Rep. Gregg Harper.</p>

<p>Doty signed qualifying papers Monday at the Republican Party headquarters. Also on Monday, business executive Morgan Dunn filed qualifying papers, according to an Associated Press report.</p>

<p>Doty, an attorney who chairs the Senate Energy committee, and Dunn, managing director of Vestra LLC — a health care consulting firm in Magee, are vying to be the first woman elected to represent Mississippi in Congress.</p>

<p>Doty has championed several women’s issues during her time in the Legislature, including equal pay initiatives and tightening of “revenge porn” laws. She has also focused on election reform, pitching early voting and online registration.</p>

<p>“Ready to take my message of common sense conservatism to the voters of District 3,” Doty tweeted Monday morning.</p>

<p>Doty and Dunn join other Republican candidates Michael Guest, district attorney for Rankin and Madison counties; Whit Hughes, a Madison businessman and longtime political campaign operative; and Perry Parker, an investment banker from Seminary.</p>

<p>Harper’s surprise announcement that he wouldn’t seek re-election set off a political chain reaction in the state, and politicos and potential candidates immediately began calling prominent donors across the state to gauge support.</p>

<p>The seat was not projected to be in play during the 2018 midterms. The sprawling district stretches from extreme southwest Mississippi to the Golden Triangle region.</p>

<p>Guest, the first candidate to officially qualify, said earlier this month he’ll focus his campaign on combating the opioid epidemic in Mississippi and nationally, addressing infrastructure concerns and ensuring the military is adequately funded.</p>

<p>Hughes, perhaps best known as the sixth man for Mississippi State University’s 1996 Final Four basketball team, is the former president and chief development officer for Baptist Health Systems and longtime political campaign operative.</p>

<p>“I believe I am the best conservative candidate for this position,” Hughes said in a statement. “I believe voters are ready for a leader to step forward … a fighter … somebody with character and backbone that will go to Capitol Hill and drive legislation that aligns with Mississippi priorities.”</p>

<h2 id="afterscramblingforfundschildprotectionservicesstillneedsd12millionfromstate">After scrambling for funds, Child Protection Services still needs $12 million from state</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Larrison Campbell</p>

<p>Rep. Preston Sullivan, D-Okolona (foreground), and Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton (sitting behind him), during Tuesday’s House Appropriations Meeting about Child Protection Services</p>

<p>Two weeks after the embattled Division of Child Protection Services stunned lawmakers by revealing a record-breaking $38 million deficit, the agency has dramatically downgraded its request to $12 million in state funds.</p>

<p>The revised estimate is due primarily to an influx of federal dollars, but the agency informed the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday that it also plans to make approximately $8 million in internal cuts this fiscal year.</p>

<p>And while a $12 million pill may be easier to swallow than one three times its size, lawmakers admit they’re still not sure where the funding will come from in an already tight year.</p>

<p>“But we’re going to have to come up with it,” said House Appropriations Chairman John Read, R-Gautier. “Where it’s going to come from, I can’t tell you right now. So we’re going to be looking across the board. That’s about all we can do.”</p>

<p>While Child Protection Services has taken a number of tacks to reduce the deficit, the crux of the solution centers on lobbying the Legislature to reverse the action that caused the problem in the first place, spinning Child Protection Services off from the Department of Human Services.</p>

<p>The Legislature voted to split Child Protection Services and the Department of Human Services in 2016, but the roots of the agency’s current financial crisis date back to 2004, when six children in foster care sued the state of Mississippi for failing to adequately provide for children in its custody. A federal court sided with the plaintiffs, known collectively as Olivia Y, and the resulting settlement has completely remade the agency, mandating everything from staff minimums to how money for the agency is appropriated.</p>

<p>The biggest change, however, was the requirement that the Legislature create a stand-alone agency for its Child and Family Services division, which had only been a department within the larger Department of Human Services. In their rush to comply with the settlement, lawmakers admit, they may have overlooked a key element of any agency — how its funding works.</p>

<p>Mississippi Child Protection Services executive director Jess Dickinson addresses members of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee during hearings in Jackson.</p>

<p>The Department of Human Services receives federal matching funds at a much higher rate than Child Protection Services— 50 percent vs nine percent, according to Jess Dickinson, the agency’s commissioner. Separating the two agencies means that Child Protection Services is no longer eligible for the increased federal funding.</p>

<p>“We thought we could do it on our own, and we went out and did it wrong,” Sen. Terry Burton, R-Newton, said earlier this month. “I’m just telling it like it is.”</p>

<p>The question of blame has swirled beneath many discussions about how the agency plans to address the problem. Dickinson, who took over the role of agency commissioner in September, told House members that by the time he arrived, “it was clear to me from a business standpoint that Child Protection Services was headed for a catastrophe.”</p>

<p>During the meeting Tuesday, Rep. Preston Sullivan, D-Okolona, put a finer point on it, asking if the responsibility for this deficit should fall on his predecessor at the agency, David Chandler.</p>

<p>“Your situation is sort of similar to inheriting the farm without knowing how much the mortgage is. … Mr. Davis’s agency is going to help you with it, so I guess the question might be, what’s this going to do to his agency? Somebody’s got to take the hit, because that’s a lot of money.” (John Davis is head of the Department of Human Services.)</p>

<p>Dickinson’s answer was clear: The Legislature is responsible.</p>

<p>“I believe that when Dr. Chandler was running CPS they represented to the Legislature that what (the agency) was going to require to comply with the requirements of the litigation, they needed an extra $70 million dollars,” Dickinson said. “I think the Legislature appropriated an extra $32 million (to the agency). Fourteen million of that was taken away the next year.”</p>

<p>“In my view, respectfully, this agency’s never been properly funded.”</p>

<p>Senate Appropriations Chair Buck Clarke, R-Hollandale, strongly disagreed with Dickson’s assessment, saying the $14 million Dickinson mentioned was actually $12 million and that it was one-time money, specific to the costs of starting up the agency.</p>

<p>“We gave them all they asked for,” Clarke said. “We knew we were under a court order.”</p>

<p>Caring for children is expensive for the state. The agency estimates that 5,800 children are in state custody. The cost of caring for a child ranges from $700 a month for a healthy child to as much as $60,000 a year for a child who has special needs.</p>

<p>Initially, the agency had expected the deficit to be $52 million. The Department of Human Services stepped in quickly, committing $13.8 million, reducing the deficit to just over $38 million, which is where it stood two weeks ago when the agency made its presentation to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee.</p>

<p>Since then, the agency said it has cancelled more than $3 million in contracts. One $1 million contract paid a company to recruit foster homes. Another multi-million dollar contract with the University of Mississippi, Dickinson said, handled staff training. Both of these functions now will be handled by in house staff.</p>

<p>The agency has also saved $5 million through a hiring freeze and by delaying implementation of a new agency-wide computer system until the next fiscal year. If the agency goes back to being a full sub-agency under the Department of Human Services, Dickinson said, he expects the budget deficit to be resolved for fiscal year 2019.</p>

<p>The current computer system, Dickinson said, is “three decades old. It operates with a green screen and a blinking cursor, and it is very difficult for employees to use.” Like updating the computer system, increasing staffing has been a requirement of the Olivia Y settlement. Dickinson said the agency still needs to hire another 240 caseworkers and 60 supervisors to comply.</p>

<p>“Of course, anything we do that compromises our ability to respond to a complaint is of concern to us,” Dickinson said. “The plaintiffs’ counsel are not going to like the fact that we’re doing a hiring freeze. They’re not going to like the fact that we’re delaying implementation of (the new computer system). But they’re going to understand there’s nothing we can do about it.”</p>

<p>Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, has authored a bill that would reverse the separation of the two agencies. The bill, which has broad legislative support, would take effect as soon as it passes, meaning the agency would qualify for more federal funds this fiscal year.</p>

<p>As a result of this, and what John Davis has called the “back room processes” of shifting some Child Protection Services services and employees into “cost pools” under the Department of Human Services, Davis expects his agency to come up with another $8 million. This means a total Department of Human Services contribution of approximately $22 million.</p>

<p>The rest of the funding would come from the $12 million state appropriation. Once the agency becomes a sub-agency of the Department of Human Services, its federal match rate will go up to 50 percent, meaning that the $12 million state contribution will become $24 million in federal and state funds.</p>

<p>Dickinson acknowledged that the Department of Human Services and other agencies were going to take a large hit to help his agency.</p>

<p>“It’s not free money. It’s going to cause some pain to people,” Dickinson said. “But you’ve got to determine priorities, and there are few priorities more important than taking care of these children.”</p>

<h2 id="womensmarchwithamorediversespeakerlineupralliesforpowertothepolls">Women’s march, with a more diverse speaker lineup, rallies for ‘power to the polls’</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Kendra Ablaza</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-19</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/20/womens-march-diverse-speaker-lineup-rallies-power-polls/ </p>

<p>Women’s health and reproductive rights, equal pay, quality public education and worker’s rights were some of the reasons hundreds of people from different parts of the state met Saturday for the Mississippi Women’s March on the south steps of the Capitol.</p>

<p>The event, one of hundreds of similar rallies and marches held in cities across the U.S. and the world, aimed to empower people of diverse backgrounds to speak on a wide range of issues and encourage more grassroots political involvement, organizers said.</p>

<p>Talamieka Brice, one of the event organizers, speaks at the Mississippi Women’s March on Saturday outside the Mississippi State Capitol.</p>

<p>The first Women’s March took place in 2017. That year, in Jackson, thousands of people showed up to march for equal rights and a better quality of life.</p>

<p>This time around, approximately 500 people carried signs and wore T-shirts promoting political causes, including immigrant and LGBTQ rights. Despite drawing a smaller crowd compared to 2017, this year’s Mississippi Women’s March shows the movement is evolving, said one of the organizers, Talamieka Brice.</p>

<p>Brice said the aim of the 2017 march was to stand up against policies newly elected President Donald Trump had proposed. This year, she said, women can celebrate the successes of the women’s movement.</p>

<p>“Everything that we were afraid of on this day last year, those policies were put forward,” Brice said. “But the resistance, the push back, has been the rallying cry. Last year was like, ‘Oh my God, what are we going to do? We have to do something.’ And this year is, ‘This is what we’ve done. It’s working. Let’s keep pushing forward and doing that.’”</p>

<p>This year’s Women’s March theme was “Rally to the Polls!,” an echo of the national march in Las Vegas whose theme is “Power to the Polls!”</p>

<p>Brice said Saturday’s rally featured a lot more voices and perspectives from women of color. The 10 speakers included women representing Muslims, LGBTQ people, journalists and people of other backgrounds.</p>

<p>Felicia Brown-Williams, Mississippi State Director of Planned Parenthood Southeast, speaks at the south steps of the Capitol during the Mississippi Women’s March.</p>

<p>This was essential, organizers said, considering that Mississippi ranked as the worst state for women in a WalletHub study from early 2017 based on factors like median wages for female workers, unemployment rates for women, percentages of women in poverty and percentages of women-owned businesses.</p>

<p>“There’s so many things that would improve the lives of women, like a raised minimum wage, an improved public education system,” said Annie Reiher of Indivisible Jackson Metro and one of the march organizers. “They’re not necessarily things that scream, ‘women’s issues.’ They’re economic issues.”</p>

<p>Reiher attended the national Women’s March in Washington, D.C. with her mother last year, but felt it was important to be a part of the march in her home state this year. She said that President Trump’s inauguration may have been a catalyst in bringing people to these kinds of rallies last year, but it may take more effort to encourage people to take part in the political process this year, with the mid-term elections ahead.</p>

<p>“It’s important to see people that look like them in the process when we’re talking about Jackson,” Reiher said. “We tried really hard to make this event representative of the community from a demographics standpoint and culturally.”</p>

<p>That effort was evident during the event’s speeches. Malaysia Walker, the Transgender Education &amp; Advocacy Program advocacy coordinator of the American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi, encouraged women to voice their frustration and needs regardless of their economic or cultural background.</p>

<p>“We have to stop allowing other people to tell our truths, because we are the only ones that know our truths,” Walker said. “Not only should we help protect others and share their story, we should listen to the stories that are being told.”</p>

<p>Speakers at the march also reflected on the recent rebirth of the #metoo movement which has encouraged women, including those in the entertainment industry and government, to speak up about their experiences with sexism — from unwanted sexual advances from male colleagues and bosses to limited opportunities for career advancement and pay raises compared to men.</p>

<p>Jackson residents Hina Qureshi (left) and Tilak Patel (right) show support for immigrants’ rights, women’s rights and other causes at the Mississippi Women’s March Saturday at the Mississippi State Capitol.</p>

<p>Jackson resident Hina Qureshi attended the Mississippi Women’s March to support immigrants’ rights, among other causes, and appreciates how the march brings many voices and opinions that are often pushed aside to the forefront.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of things at the state and local level that I’m concerned about,” she said, which includes people whose parents brought them to U.S. as children without proper documentation. “With the dreamers, Salvadorans, everything that’s going on … it’s just a general environment of hostility.”</p>

<p>She said she would like to see more college and high school students involved in events like women’s marches to learn more about the political process and their rights.</p>

<p>Barbara Tucker, who attended the rally to support the Jackson Women’s Health Organization, said the event creates a safe space for people to unite and voice the political issues that mean a lot to them.</p>

<p>“Abortion is not an issue that’s openly talked about, so I think all of us being here today, just supporting, (sends) the message that it is something that we can talk about and have an opinion about,” Tucker said.</p>

<h2 id="republicantalkingpointsleavequestionsonschoolfunding">Republican talking points leave questions on school funding</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Kate Royals</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-16</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/17/republican-talking-points-leave-questions-on-school-funding/ </p>

<p>A “talking points” memo disseminated to House Republicans about House Bill 957.</p>

<p>As the House geared up Wednesday to debate a plan scrapping the Mississippi Adequate Education Program, talking points given to House Republicans about the bill still leave some questions unanswered.</p>

<p>One major question is whether funds currently going to education programs but funded outside of the formula will be covered by the new formula – and whether schools will truly get more money.</p>

<p>“The bill increases the overall investment in education by over $107 million in its estimated final implementation year,” the handout titled “Talking Points for House Bill 957” states.</p>

<p>But where that $107 million will come from remains to be determined.</p>

<p>House Education Chairman Richard Bennett, a Republican from Long Beach, told the Associated Press last week that funds outside of the formula for areas such as National Board Certified Teacher salary supplements, vocational and technical education, and 3rd grade reading coaches, among others could be swept in to the new allocation.</p>

<p>Second page of a “talking points” memo given to House Republicans about House Bill 957.</p>

<p>The statement raises questions about whether schools will see an actual increase in funding or whether existing money will simply be shifted around.</p>

<p>Meg Annison, a spokeswoman for Speaker Philip Gunn, who authored House Bill 957, said sources of funding will be determined each year based on revenue.</p>

<p>She also noted that schools would be funded at the same amount as the current fiscal year for the next two years, and some could see slight increases in funding corresponding with an increase in student enrollment.</p>

<p>The handout also defends the formula’s use of Census, rather than free and reduced lunch (students at or below 130 percent of the poverty income threshold, and between 130 and 185 percent of the poverty income threshold), numbers to calculate low-income students.</p>

<p>Because a new rule allows school districts with a certain percentage of its students on public assistance programs to provide all of its students free and reduced meals, the data has become “completely distorted,” the document says.</p>

<p>Several lawmakers, however, expressed concern that Census numbers are inaccurate and include students enrolled in private schools, thus distorting the number of low-income children in the area public schools.</p>

<p>Under the new formula, low-income students receive an additional 25 percent of the base student cost, or an additional $1,200, in funding.</p>

<p>“The current formula deems 70 percent of all students in the state as ‘at-risk,’ providing 5 percent more to these students. This bill increases that to 25 percent more, and better targets funds to the districts serving the highest needs students,” the handout states.</p>

<p>“Because Census poverty is published by an impartial, third party and there is a direct relationship between high Census poverty rates and participation in other safety net programs, it removes concerns about inaccurately identifying low-income student populations.”</p>

<p>The document also defends the decision to retain the 27 percent rule, which allows property-rich districts to receive additional state funds, allowing them to keep their local tax rate lower. An estimated $120 million in state funds is sent to property-rich districts under the 27 percent rule instead of having those funds available for districts that are struggling.</p>

<p>“The bill affirms the legislature’s commitment to continuing to consider taxpayer equity for all communities by calling for a study of alternate options to the 27 percent rule, but reflects the realization that funding policy with such a dramatic potential effect should not be legislated overnight,” it states.</p>

<p>Rebecca Sibilia, CEO of the consulting group EdBuild, called the 27 percent rule “inequitable” and “not good for kids,” and the removal of the provision was a key component of the group’s recommendations.</p>

<h2 id="tofixfundingmistakechildprotectionserviceslikelyrejoinshumanservices">To fix funding mistake, Child Protection Services likely rejoins Human Services</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Larrison Campbell</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-15</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/16/to-fix-funding-mistake-child-protection-services-likely-rejoins-human-services/ </p>

<p>Two years after a lawsuit forced the Legislature to turn Child Protection Services into a stand-alone agency, the director says a record-breaking deficit will compel the agency to rejoin the Department of Human Services.</p>

<p>The move, being considered just days after Child Protection Services announced a $39 million hole in its budget for fiscal year 2018, would effectively make CPS a sub-agency of the Department of Human Services.</p>

<p>Mississippi Child Protection Services executive director Jess Dickinson.</p>

<p>The agency’s commissioner, Jess Dickinson, said the move is largely administrative, designed to help Child Protection Services receive the federal matching funds it has lost since the agency split from DHS in 2016. Although CPS is eligible for matching funds, too, Mississippi’s Department of Human Services has a much higher federal match rate.</p>

<p>“It was a terrible prospect and we’ve had to act quickly,” Dickinson said. “So the best financial picture for CPS is to remain a sub-agency so we can draw down those federal funds.”</p>

<p>Currently two bills introduced in the House and Senate aim to rejoin the agencies. According to Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, who worked with CPS on the House bill, the legislation “won’t change the substance of how these agencies operate.” If this legislation passes, it would reunite Child Protection Services with the Department of Human Services on July 1 — coincidentally, the same day the split of the two agencies would have been finalized.</p>

<p>Dickinson told a House appropriations subcommittee on Monday that if the Legislature is able to again fold Child Protection Services under the Department of Human Services umbrella, CPS likely will be financially solvent for fiscal year 2019.</p>

<p>What is less certain, he admits, is where the agency will find the nearly $40 million to keep it financially solvent for fiscal year 2018. Unlike many state agencies, Child Protection Services is unable to make any staffing cuts, the result of the same court-ordered settlement agreement that mandated the agencies split in the first place.</p>

<p>“When you talk about cutting our budget, there’s not much to cut when you start getting into the weeds of how to care for these children,” Dickinson said. “So it’s a very serious issue. These aren’t discretionary things. We’ve got to take care of these children, we have to. So we’ve got to find this money.”</p>

<p>The most likely scenario, according to Dickinson, is the funds will come from a combination of state and federal dollars. If the state can appropriate two-thirds of the money to make up for deficit, or approximately $26 million, he said the rest will likely come from federal funds.</p>

<p>“The Legislature seems to understand that we’re going to need some deficit appropriation, and the governor and DHS are very serious about finding us additional (federal) money,” Dickinson said. “And that’s all that can be done right now to improve our financial picture. And it’s going to be done. If you want my opinion, I think it’s going to work out. We just need a little time.</p>

<p>“But nobody wants to put these children in the street so I think everybody’s going to respond to this crisis.”</p>

<p>Although the Legislature did not vote to split Child Protection Services and the Department of Human Services until 2016, the roots of the agency’s current financial crisis date back to 2004, when six children in foster care sued the state of Mississippi for failing to adequately provide for children in its custody. A federal court sided with the plaintiffs, and the resulting settlement has completely remade the agency, mandating everything from staff minimums to how money for the agency is appropriated.</p>

<p>The biggest change, however, was the requirement that the Legislature create a stand-alone agency for its Child and Family Services division, which had only been a department within the larger DHS. In their rush to comply with the settlement, however, lawmakers admit they may have overlooked a key element of any agency — how its funding works.</p>

<p>In the Senate Appropriations subcommittee meeting last week, when Dickinson announced the record-breaking deficit, Sen. Terry Burton, R-Newton, admitted the Legislature “did it wrong.”</p>

<p>Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton</p>

<p>Gipson, who is sponsoring the House bill to make CPS a sub-agency of DHS, elaborated on this point after Monday’s House Appropriations subcommittee meeting.</p>

<p>“I would at some point like to peel back the layers and determine what happened here, what false assumptions got us to this point,” said Gipson. “We’re not in the business of creating new agencies. Most of the agencies we’ve had have been around for decades, some even longer. So this is a unique crisis driven by this settlement and a unique set of circumstances.”</p>

<h2 id="mississippiboomingtothemaxinmeridian">Mississippi booming to The MAX in Meridian</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Susan Marquez</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-12</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/13/mississippi-booming-to-the-max-in-meridian/ </p>

<p>The view from the 22nd Avenue bridge in Meridian has changed dramatically over the past year. The iconic U Needa Biscuit sign painted on the side of an abandoned building is being upstaged by construction of the Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Complex on Front Street and 22nd Avenue, overlooking the railroad tracks.</p>

<p>“It’s going to change the look of downtown Meridian,” said Bill Hannah, president and CEO of the East Mississippi Business and Development Corporation. “With an estimated 200,000 visitors the first year, The MAX (as the complex is known) will have a tremendous impact on downtown Meridian, as well as Lauderdale County.”</p>

<p>Across downtown Meridian, sidewalks are being resurfaced, newly sold old buildings are being brought back to life with restaurants and retail, and residents are exuding a feeling of excitement.</p>

<p>Construction on The MAX in downtown Meridian</p>

<p>“All these sleeping giants in downtown Meridian are waking up,” said Mark Tullos, executive director of The MAX, who came to the east Mississippi city from Louisiana, where he oversaw the state’s museums.</p>

<p>“One of the things that attracted me to the job is the inventory of wonderful real estate in Meridian, such as the remarkable Three Foot Building,” he said.</p>

<p>The MAX’s grand opening is set for April 27 with a black tie gala, but “it has to be finished before the 27th,” Tullos said.</p>

<p>“We have tours scheduled for legislators, the media and front line convention and visitors’ bureau staff in the days leading up to the gala,” he said.</p>

<p>The MAX will tell the stories of legendary Mississippi artists, such as Elvis Presley, Morgan Freeman, William Faulkner, Jim Henson, Tennessee Williams, B. B. King, Eudora Welty, Leontyne Price, Walter Anderson, Faith Hill and Jimmie Rodgers, and show the impact of Mississippi’s creative legacy.</p>

<p>The idea began with country music singer and radio personality Paul Ott Carruth. In 2001, the Mississippi Legislature established the Southern Arts and Entertainment Center Inc. That name later was changed to The Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Experience.</p>

<p>Fundraising was slowed by Hurricane Katrina and a major economic recession. Despite the obstacles, the State of Mississippi pledged $29 million to the project, and more than $14 million has been pledged from private businesses and individuals. A 2 percent sales tax on prepared food and beverages in Meridian went into effect Nov. 1, and it is expected to generate approximately $2.5 million annually for 10 years. Nearly 70 percent of Meridian residents voted for the tax.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Experience is not a traditional museum, Tullos said.</p>

<p>“We will have some artifacts, but we are not a collection facility,” he said. “Instead, we will have interactive displays that help teach people about the contributions of creative, talented Mississippians. It will be an entertainment experience for sure, but the museum part is that this will be a teaching component.</p>

<p>“Not only will visitors learn about the musicians, actors, artists and writers from Mississippi, they’ll learn more about the state itself and why so many are inspired here&lt;” he continued. “We will share the overwhelming impact of Mississippi’s creative legacy, honoring legends of the past and inspiring young artists of the future.”</p>

<p>A rendering of The Living Room exhibit inside The MAX in Meridian</p>

<p>Each year a ceremony will be held for a Hall of Fame inductee, a world-famous musician, actor or media personality, visual artist, author and other artist who can trace their roots to Mississippi. Considered the centerpiece of The MAX, the Hall of Fame space will soar two stories and feature touchscreens, sound and moving imagery.</p>

<p>This year’s Hall of Fame ceremony will be at the Riley Center in downtown Meridian.</p>

<p>“We will have a family day luncheon for the recipients, followed by the ceremony where we will present each award to either the artist, the family or foundation members,” Tullos said. “We are hoping they’ll all come back for our grand opening.”</p>

<p>This year’s inductees are musical artists Robert Johnson, B.B. King, Elvis Presley, Leontyne Price, Jimmie Rodgers and Muddy Waters; writers William Faulkner, John Grisham, Eudora Welty, Tennessee Williams and Richard Wright; actors Morgan Freeman, James Earl Jones and Sela Ward; visual artists Walter Anderson and George Ohr; and entertainers Jim Henson and Oprah Winfrey.</p>

<p>Ward, a native of Meridian, serves as chairwoman of the Honorary Celebrity Committee, following such chairmen as Faith Hill and Marty Stuart. Others on the committee are Freeman, Grisham, Price, Tom Lester, Freeman, Jimmy Buffett, Charley Pride, Britney Spears, Three Doors Down and Jim Henson’s Kermit the Frog.</p>

<p>A rendering of the Juke Joint exhibition area at The MAX.</p>

<p>Building The MAX in Meridian was, in part, a matter of practicality.</p>

<p>“Meridian is a perfect position on the interstate,” Tullos explained. “And we had room for it.</p>

<p>“I-20 goes right through here, so anyone going from Dallas to Atlanta passes through Meridian. We are also very close to Memphis and New Orleans,” he continued. “Instead of people pulling off to refuel or grab a burger, we want them to come to The MAX and learn more about Mississippi, perhaps planning future trips to visit other parts of the state. We will be featuring other cultural institutions and museums around Mississippi.</p>

<p>“This is not a Meridian thing; this is a Mississippi thing,” he said. “We want to promote all parts of the state.”</p>

<p>Paula Chance, marketing and communications director for The MAX, reinforces the promotional component.</p>

<p>“We want to do all we can to get people to come visit us, but, at the same time, each of the stories told here and each of the interactives will lead to other people and places around the state,” she said.</p>

<p>“There will be a kiosk that allows visitors to create their own tour map, and it will customize trips to meet special needs and interests,” she said. “The tour map will be available on smart phones or can be printed out to purchase in the gift shop.”</p>

<p>The People Place exhibit space at The Mississippi Arts + Entertainment Experience in Meridian</p>

<p>Visitors are expected to spend two to three hours in The MAX.</p>

<p>The second floor galleries will explore six Mississippi influences on artists: The Home, The Church, The People, The Community, The Land and The World.</p>

<p>“These are very sophisticated exhibits that will serve as a teaching vehicle for visitors,” Chance said. “For example, there will be an actual chapel built inside for The Church exhibit. The brick on the exterior of the chapel, as well as the pews, are from a church in Collinsville that was destroyed by a tornado.”</p>

<p>The stained-glass window in the church is being made by artist Andy Young of Pearl River Glass in Jackson.</p>

<p>“The design tells the story of the arts in Mississippi,” Young said.</p>

<p>The intricate design contains images of “Lucille,” the guitar B.B. King made famous, as well as other images that reference Mississippi art, music and literature.</p>

<p>An exhibit area of The MAX in Meridian</p>

<p>Visitors to The MAX also will experience forming a pot on a wheel in the style of three different Mississippi potters. A kitchen section will project onto a plate food that is prepared by Mississippi chefs.</p>

<p>“There will be a lot of new technology designed specifically for this museum,” Chance said.</p>

<p>The MAX will offer four studios downstairs that can be used by visiting artists.</p>

<p>“We will have a paint studio, a pottery studio, a recording studio and a broadcast studio. Upstairs classroom space is large enough for 20 to 30 kids to do projects at one time,” Chance said.</p>

<p>A large multipurpose room for events, and a large terrace upstairs will accommodate 100 to 150 people.</p>

<p>“There will be a lot of teaching and learning opportunities throughout the museum, as well as places for people to gather and socialize,” Chance said.</p>

<p>Spectators watch as Gov. Phil Bryant delivers his State of the State address on Tuesday in the House chamber.</p>

<p>This is one in a series of stories produced by students taking a state government reporting class at the University of Mississippi’s Meek School of Journalism and New Media. The class is led by Mississippi Today co-editor Fred Anklam Jr. and Meek school journalism professor LaReeca Rucker. </p>

<p>JACKSON — The Mississippi Legislature convened in the Capitol on Tuesday to start its 133rd regular legislative session and issues surrounding education and roads are already dominating the conversation</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves and House Speaker Philip Gunn are currently pushing a reallocation of the Mississippi Adequate Education Program, the state education funding formula. After a failed attempt by the Legislature to change the school formula in 2017, a new bill is being drafted.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the Mississippi Economic Council heard from a number of officials including Gov. Phil Bryant, Reeves, Gunn and Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann on its annual Capital Day.</p>

<p>Each of these officials shed light on their stances about improving the job market in Mississippi with a higher educated workforce and what this would mean for the state. Gunn expressed the value of having an educated workforce to the business leaders.</p>

<p>“If our workforce is well educated and trained, we’re going to prosper,” said Gunn. “If it’s not, we won’t.”</p>

<p>Reeves explained to students from Ole Miss in a private interview that he has a political philosophy that he does not believe it is the job of the government to create jobs, however that he does believe that the government’s role is to create an environment that encourages members of the private sector to create jobs.</p>

<p>He said that this leads back to the quality of our education systems.</p>

<p>Fred Anklam Jr., Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves granted an interview to the Ole Miss Capitol Press Corps class.</p>

<p>“If we’re going to convince folks in the private sector to invest capital and create jobs, they’ve got to know that there’s a workforce available who can actually fill those jobs,” said Reeves. “For us to be able to provide that workforce, we have to improve the educational attainment level of our citizens.”</p>

<p>The lieutenant governor explained that the percentage of students graduating from high school in Mississippi has increased twelve percentage points in the past five years, nearly aligning with the national average. This increase has allowed 3,000 more people to have a high school degree and the opportunity to attend one of Mississippi’s community colleges before entering the workforce.</p>

<p>The educated workforce is one of the largest concerns of the business leaders in MEC.</p>

<p>“If we can’t get the right workforce, our businesses will die,” said MEC Chairman William Yates, CEO of Yates Construction Company.</p>

<p>The Capital Day included a panel of business leaders who held a discussion on regionalism and the impact it has on workforce development. The panel included Ashley Edwards from Gulf Coast Business Council-One Coast, Bill Hannah from East Mississippi Business Development Corporation, Brenda Lathan from Golden Triangle Development Link, and Michael Philpot from the Delta Council-Delta Strong.</p>

<p>Scott Waller also was named the new executive director of MEC.</p>

<p>Business leaders in MEC then got to go to the Capitol and hear from more elected officials and were asked to support the Legislature moving forward.</p>

<h2 id="edgarraykillenklansmanconvictedincivilrightsworkersslayingdiesinprison">Edgar Ray Killen, klansman convicted in civil rights workers slaying, dies in prison</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Mississippi Today</p>

<p id="date">date: 2018-01-11</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/12/edgar-ray-killen-klansman-convicted-in-civil-rights-workers-slaying-dies-in-prison/ </p>

<p>Edgar Ray “Preacher” Killen, the last person convicted of taking part in the 1964 murders of three civil rights activists in Neshoba County, died in prison Thursday night, officials announced Friday. He was 92.</p>

<p>On June 29, 1964, the FBI began distributing these pictures of civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, 24, of New York, James Chaney, 21, from Mississippi, and Andrew Goodman, 20, of New York, who disappeared near Philadelphia, Miss., June 21, 1964.</p>

<p>In June 2005, at the age of 80, Killen was sentenced to 60 years in prison on three manslaughter convictions in the slayings of civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner in a state trial, which drew national attention because of the case’s notoriety and the length of time it took to bring someone to justice.</p>

<p>The killings also were the basis for the 1988 movie, “Mississippi Burning,” which is what the FBI dubbed the case.</p>

<p>An autopsy and funeral services for Killen are pending.</p>

<p>Attorney General Jim Hood and District Attorney Mark Duncan prosecuted him in 2005 before Circuit Judge Marcus Gordon.</p>

<p>In June 2016, Hood officially closed the wider investigation in the case, saying possible defendants in the civil-rights killings either were dead or without credible witnesses to testify against them.</p>

<p>A Neshoba County jury convicted Killen of three counts of manslaughter when it deadlocked on murder charges.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, his conviction in the deaths of Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner came on June 21, 2005 — exactly 41 years after their slayings at the hands of Ku Klux Klan members in the East Central Mississippi county.</p>

<p>The three civil rights activists were in Mississippi to help organize voter-registration drives for African Americans. Chaney was from Meridian and Goodman and Schwerner were from New York. Their deaths brought national attention to the civil rights movement and help speed passage of the Voting Rights Act.</p>

<p>“[Killen’s] life spanned a period in this country where members of the Ku Klux Klan like him were able to believe they had a right to take other people’s lives, and that’s a form of terrorism,” Goodman’s brother, David, told the Associated Press on Friday. “Many took black lives without impunity.”</p>

<p>Born Jan. 17, 1925, Killen was the son of Lonnie Ray Killen and Etta Killen. He was a sawmill operator and part-time minister.</p>

<p>In the Ku Klux Klan, Killen reached the position of “kleagle” or recruiter and organizer for local chapters in Neshoba and nearby Lauderdale counties.</p>

<p>His 2005 trial was not the first time law enforcement authorities looked at Killen’s involvement in the 1964 murders. Although state prosecutors made little effort to find the killers, in 1965, Killen was one of 18 men arrested and prosecuted by Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall on federal charges that they conspired to violate the victims’ civil rights.</p>

<p>The 1966 trial in Meridian by an all-white jury convicted seven conspirators, but for Killen, it ended with a hung jury with jurors deadlocked 11-1 in favor of conviction. The lone holdout said she could not convict a preacher. He was released when the prosecution decided not to try again.</p>

<p>More than 20 years later, new evidence from new witnesses surfaced regarding the three murders and Killen was accused of state charges on Jan. 6, 2005. His jury of nine whites and three blacks rejected murder charges but found him guilty of recruiting the mob that carried out the killings.</p>

<p>The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed his conviction 8-0, with one judge not participating, in 2007.</p>

<p>Ole Miss students taking a winter session course offered by the Meek School of Journalism &amp; New Media on covering state government pose outside the Capitol in Jackson.</p>

<p>Eight students from the University of Mississippi’s Meek School of Journalism &amp; New Media spent the first two weeks of January in an intercession class focused on reporting about state government and public policy issues.</p>

<p>The class, led by Meek journalism professor LaReeca Rucker and Mississippi Today Co-editor Fred Anklam Jr., included several days each week in Jackson covering activities at the Capitol and interviewing leading state officials. The course was held in conjunction with the Mississippi Press Association, of which Mississippi Today is a digital affiliate.</p>

<p>The course is designed to give students a firsthand experience in both the daily and long term responsibilities of covering state government and issues impacting the state. Students chose topics of interest to focus a major story on but also were in the Capitol to observe other activities such as the Mississippi Economic Council’s Capital Day.</p>

<p>The Meek School, the Mississippi Press Association and Mississippi Today thank Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, Attorney General Jim Hood and Speaker of the House Philip Gunn and their staffs for arranging time for the class to meet with each of them for interviews that allowed the students to gain better understanding of their priorities for Mississippi.</p>

<h2 id="groupreadieslegislationaimedatearlyvotingonlineregistration">Group readies legislation aimed at early voting, online registration</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alex Rozier</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2018/01/12/group-readies-legislation-aimed-at-early-voting-online-registration/ </p>

<p>ACLU-MS</p>

<p>Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson, Attorney Kim Turner and NAACP Mississippi Executive Director Corey Wiggins</p>

<p>A group of Mississippi leaders met Friday to discuss the roadblocks that exist for people to vote, focusing primarily on potential legislation that would allow early voting and online voter registration.</p>

<p>Sen. David Blount, D-Jackson, Secretary of State Attorney Kim Turner, and Executive Director of NAACP Mississippi Corey Wiggins participated in a panel on expanding voter access.</p>

<p>The event was hosted by the ACLU of Mississippi at the Mississippi College School of Law.</p>

<p>“I believe the government will be better off if more people participate,” said Blount, who is the vice-chair of the Senate Elections Committee. “The fewer people participate, the weaker your government will be. The balancing act has always been participation and people being freely able to express their right, and any concerns that people may have about fraud.”</p>

<p>In 2011, Mississippi voters approved a bill to require bringing a voter ID to cast a ballot. The law, which Blount said during the panel he opposes, went into effect in 2014. It requires voters show one of 10 forms of photo identification.</p>

<p>“We talk about fraud, waste and abuse in Medicaid, we talk about fraud, waste and abuse in SNAP programs, we talk about fraud, waste and abuse of any public assistance program that is out there,” Wiggins said, “but we have yet to find substantial amounts of data that shows that exists. So I talk about that same context when we’re talking about the ability of people to vote.</p>

<p>“Particularly in a state where we’re struggling from a budgetary standpoint, and we want to spend money to limit opportunity for folks to vote; looking at the number of cases of fraud and abuse, just look at the data and see: is it worth the investment?”</p>

<p>Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann pushed reform to implement both early voting and online registration in 2016.</p>

<p>The ACLU plans to revive those efforts this legislative session with bills sponsored by Rep. Jarvis Dortch, D-Raymond, and Rep. Noah Sanford, R-Collins, in the House and Sen. Hillman Terome Frazier, D-Jackson, in the Senate.</p>

<p>Turner explained that passing such reform presents logistical obstacles for getting election officials, clerks and poll workers all on the same page.</p>

<p>“Early voting is a non-partisan matter,” she said. “Every election official in the state wants to see increased voter participation and ease to cast your ballot, but you have 410 commissioners and 82 clerks that are all going to have a different view about how this should and who should be responsible for what.”</p>

<p>Those obstacles include planning specific details, Turner said, like figuring out where to keep voting machines for early voters and ensuring the ballots are secure.</p>

<p>“It poses a challenge, and [the clerks and election officials] already have a lot of work as it is right now. You’re adding one more thing without any additional pay or compensation,” she said.</p>

<p>Along with the ACLU, the League of Women Voters, Mississippi Votes, and Women for Progress of Mississippi helped organize the panel.</p>

<p>“There’s a moral obligation, a birthright to participate in having a voice in how you want your community to look,” Wiggins said. “As a country, and as a state particularly, we make it hard for folks to exercise that right.”</p>

<p>According to the United States Election Project, an online study of voter participation, Mississippi ranked 44th in turnout with 55.5 percent in the general election in 2016.</p>

<h2 id="franklincountyschooldistrictawaitsdesegregationruling">Franklin County School District awaits desegregation ruling</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Kate Royals</p>

<p id="date">date: 2017-12-26</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2017/12/27/franklin-county-school-district-awaits-desegregation-ruling/ </p>

<p>The Franklin County School District is still waiting for a federal judge to decide whether it can be removed from a nearly 50-year-old federal desegregation order.</p>

<p>Federal Judge Henry Wingate</p>

<p>Despite the U.S. Department of Justice indicating in June that it would not oppose the release of the district, U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate has not yet ruled on the matter.</p>

<p>Representatives from both the school district and the Department of Justice attended a four-day fairness hearing in August. At the hearing, the court heard from the school district’s witnesses and members of the community who were opposed to the lifting of the order.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the hearing, Wingate, who has recently been barred from taking on new cases because of a large backlog, said he wanted more information before making a decision.</p>

<p>He asked the school district for more information and statistics regarding alternative school and youth court referrals, the district’s dropout rate, allegations of nepotism in the district and whether any teachers without certification were currently teaching in the district. He also asked the federal government to submit a position statement clarifying whether it would still support removing the district from the order.</p>

<p>Wikipedia</p>

<p>On Sept. 1, the U.S. Department of Justice submitted a statement of its position that it would continue not to oppose the district’s motion to be released from federal oversight.</p>

<p>“Witness testimony (at the fairness hearing) indicated persistent gaps in communication between District officials and community members surrounding issues of hiring and discipline,” the Department of Justice wrote in its statement.</p>

<p>“However, the United States was encouraged to hear the District’s witnesses testify about the District’s recent incorporation of hiring committees designed to introduce multiple viewpoints into its hiring decisions and practices; their support for maintaining clear and consistent procedures for hiring and discipline and preserving relevant records; and their openness to communication with community members and District employees,” the statement continued. “The United States supports the District’s efforts to improve recordkeeping, transparency and communication.”</p>

<p>Mississippi still has a large number of school districts — 42 of 144 total, according to the U.S. Department of Justice — under desegregation orders. These orders were filed in the the 1960s and 1970s following the South’s reluctance to adhere to the Supreme Court’s landmark desegregation decision in Brown v. Board of Education.</p>

<p>Charter schools in rural settings was the topic of community conversations in Clarksdale and Indianola organized by Mississippi Today last fall. Mississippi’s first rural charter school is scheduled to open next fall in Clarksdale.

<p>2017 has been remarkable for Mississippi and for Mississippi Today. It is the 200th year of statehood, and it is the first full calendar year during which our reporters and editors have recounted current events in the state and shared the reasons and the repercussions with you, our readers.</p>

<p>Here are some of our most memorable moments this year in Mississippi:</p>

<p>• Mississippi Today’s story about a lawmaker’s refusal to take up a proposal adding domestic violence as a grounds for divorce in the state led to public outcry. Following widespread criticism, the Mississippi Legislature sought an alternative solution, which involved amending a separate bill to make it easier for domestic violence victims to leave their spouse.</p>

<p>Rep. Karl Oliver, R-Winona</p>

<p>• Our reporters broke the news of state Rep. Karl Oliver’s hate speech on Facebook, and closely followed the social media uproar which led to his denouncement by the state’s top elected officials. Calls for Oliver to resign came from many of his fellow legislators, as well as the Mississippi NAACP and Mississippi Legislative Black Caucus.</p>

<p>• Mississippi Today’s revelation of a little-known bill that would abolish the Mississippi Arts Commission created a firestorm of local activism supporting the granting and service agency. Several activist groups formed, including SAVE MAC. Continued coverage by Mississippi Today led to the bill’s death one week after the story was reported on our site.</p>

<p>Ashley F.G. Norwood, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>A lab tech prepares a body for autopsy in the Mississippi Medical Examiner’s office in Pearl.</p>

<p>• Our investigation into critical funding shortages at the state medical examiner’s office revealed that severe under-staffing in the morgue and crime lab are fueling a public safety crisis. Mississippi’s three medical examiners each performs between 500 and 600 autopsies a year, more than double the 250 that the National Association of Medical Examiners recommends. Over the last few years, a state crime lab staff has been whittled down from 120 to just 85, and the backlog of cases has exploded from basically zero to more than 3,000 reports. As a result, lawmakers are expected to address the problem in the 2018 legislative session.</p>

<p>• Mississippi Today reporters broke the state’s first story of sexual harassment by a lawmaker, obtaining critical background information from the Speaker of the House.</p>

<p>• The Mississippi Today series on millennial brain drain was heralded by business leaders, public officials and educators. Mississippi Today moderated a panel discussion on the topic in collaboration with the Mississippi Gulf Coast Business Council. A public forum on the topic was held in conjunction with Millsaps College.</p>

<p>At Mississippi Today, we look beyond the daily news for issues that have an impact on Mississippians:</p>

<p>A flyer, distributed at African American churches in Oktibbeha County last month, urges residents to vote for the sale of OCH Regional Medical Center.</p>

<p>• We took a deeper look at health care statewide, with a special focus on rural areas. Our series on the effort by local supervisors in Oktibbeha County to sell the sole local hospital brought statewide attention to the importance of maintaining community medical facilities. Subsequently, after a contentious campaign, voters in a referendum resolved to keep OCH Medical Center in county hands.</p>

<p>• A Mississippi Today investigation of the impacts of Mississippi’s largest ever tax cut shed light on the nuances of the bill. Our reports on the failure of a similar program in Kansas paired with the feedback of independent economists provided facts about the impacts the cuts would have on the state budget.</p>

<p>• In Fall 2017, Mississippi Today launched its inaugural multimedia project “Behind the Headlines,” featuring students, residents and administrators of the newly formed Cleveland Central High School and their reactions – in their own words—to the federally mandated school desegregation. The project incorporates documentary style photography and video interviews, and links to the ongoing series of reports about the desegregation process.</p>

<p>• Reporters wrote multiple stories on school funding in Mississippi, and provided an in-depth look at the development of charter schools around the state. We probed into the Mississippi Department of Education’s contracting procedures and helped readers navigate the landscape of an unprecedented partnership carving a new trajectory for the Jackson Public School system.</p>

<p>Daniel Coston</p>

<p>• Mississippi Today’s sports reporting may start with the score, but columnist Rick Cleveland also tells the heartwarming and heartbreaking stories of the men and women, boys and girls who play and coach the games. His series on brain injuries in football, specifically chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.) victims from Mississippi, included interviews with family members and follow-up reports on the debilitating disease. Cleveland was inducted to into the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame in August 2017 and was honored as Mississippi Sports Writer of the Year for the 10th time by the National Sports Media Foundation.</p>

<p>• Mississippi Today Data was launched to give readers easy access to critical public information that the ordinary citizen likely has difficulty tracking down. #MSTodayData includes county-by-county searchable databases on the salaries of state officials, population change, income, unemployment and other information. The data page is regularly updated to reflect changes in statistical information.</p>

<p>• And we had some fun along the way. The Ultimate Mississippi Playlist, a bicentennial year celebration, features 25 songs ranging from classic to contemporary selected by our readers. The bi-monthly competition of favorite Mississippi tunes created an interactive forum for discussion on both our web site and on social media. The final playlist debuted on Mississippi Public Broadcasting Radio as a special edition of Next Stop Mississippi and is available as a podcast. The Ultimate Mississippi Playlist can be found on Mississippi Today’s Spotify channel.</p>

<h2 id="gulfporthasspecialelectiontuesdaytofillvacantsenateseat">Gulfport has special election Tuesday to fill vacant Senate seat</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Ganucheau</p>

<p id="date">date: 2017-12-17</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2017/12/18/gulfport-has-special-election-tuesday-to-fill-vacant-senate-seat/ </p>

<p>Three candidates are vying Tuesday for a state Senate seat left vacant by Sean Tindell, who was appointed to the Mississippi Court of Appeals earlier this year.</p>

<p>The district in question mostly serves the city of Gulfport, and voters will choose between Dan Carr, a Baptist youth pastor; Joel Carter, a real estate developer; and Ron Meyers, an event planner.</p>

<p>Special legislative elections are technically nonpartisan under state law, but a look at campaign finance reports hint at a candidate’s political leanings in any given race.</p>

<p>Carter raised by far the most cash for the race – $165,000, including a $75,000 loan from Carter himself. His finance report shows donations from conservative elected officials, Coast business moguls, and Jackson political action committees.</p>

<p>Republican Gov. Phil Bryant’s political action committee cut a $1,000 check to Carter. Gulfport Mayor Billy Hewes, who held the seat in question for 20 years before running for lieutenant governor in 2011, gave Carter $500 through his own political action committee.</p>

<p>Carter also received contributions from several Jackson-based PACs, including the Mississippi Association of Educators PAC, the Mississippi Realtors PAC, and the Mississippi Public Education PAC.</p>

<p>If Carter were elected, he’d be in the good graces of his new boss, Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves, who received a $2,500 contribution from Carter’s campaign committee in October.</p>

<p>Carr raised $7,400 for the race, while Meyers raised $3,000.</p>

<p>If no single candidate garners 50 percent of the vote, a runoff would occur on Jan. 9.</p>

<h2 id="departmentofpublicsafetytoreinstatetensofthousandsdriverslicenses">Department of Public Safety to reinstate tens of thousands driver’s licenses</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alex Rozier</p>

<p id="date">date: 2017-12-18</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2017/12/19/department-of-public-safety-to-reinstate-tens-of-thousands-drivers-licenses/ </p>

<p>Tens of thousands of Mississippi drivers will be allowed back on the road in 2018.</p>

<p>In January, licenses suspended solely for failing to pay fines or fees will be reinstated after a reversal in the Department of Public Safety’s policy. The Southern Poverty Law Center and the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law announced the change Tuesday.</p>

<p>“Being poor in Mississippi is hard enough without having your license suspended just because you can’t afford to pay off outstanding fines,” said Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center. “We don’t have subways or other reliable public transportation in Mississippi, and a suspended license makes it impossible to legally drive to job interviews, take loved ones to the hospital, pick your kids up from school, or even go to church.”</p>

<p>Johnson told Mississippi Today that, along with SPLC, the MacArthur Justice Center began talks with DPS at the beginning of the year, after the groups observed that there was no process being used to determine whether defendants failing to pay was willful or out of poverty.</p>

<p>“I had been told by judges in Mississippi that they often wound up imposing fines on the same people time after time because they would get stopped for driving with suspended licenses,” Johnson said. “Its a fiction to think people in that situation are never going to drive.”</p>

<p>“We’re setting people up to be driven deeper into debt,” he added.</p>

<p>University of Mississippi</p>

<p>Director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi Cliff Johnson.</p>

<p>Under the new procedures, DPS will also waive its $100 reinstatement fee, will notify drivers that their licenses are no longer suspended and will instruct motorists how to reinstate them.</p>

<p>“We will continue to suspend licenses for other reasons allowed under Mississippi law, and we certainly take it seriously when people drive with suspended licenses,” said Marshall Fisher, Director of DPS. “The reinstatement of these licenses will not relieve the drivers of the legal obligation to pay the fines, fees, or assessments.”</p>

<p>Other reasons for license suspensions include finding a driver in contempt for failure to pay a fine and failing to respond to a traffic summons or citation.</p>

<p>SPLC and the MacArthur Justice Center contend that Mississippi courts have not been following the law regarding collection of fines and fees, and both entities have been pursuing litigation throughout Mississippi addressing the rights of indigent defendants, according to a joint press release.</p>

<p>“Poverty is not a traffic crime,” said Sam Brooke, SPLC deputy legal director. “There is a growing recognition across the country that people should not face additional punishment just because of their poverty.”</p>

<p>According to the DPS, over 100,000 licenses were suspended in-part from failing to pay fines; licenses suspended for other reasons, however, will not be reinstated. Johnson advised that suspended drivers wait until they receive a letter from DPS to see how the policy affects them, or to call 601-987-1224 for more information.</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2017/12/15/ruling-awaited-in-federal-lawsuit-over-equal-education-access/ </p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center is still awaiting a federal judge’s decision on whether to dismiss a lawsuit that alleges the state fails to provide all Mississippians access to a fair and uniform education as required under an 1869 federal law.</p>

<p>In May, the group filed a lawsuit on behalf of four public school mothers arguing that the effects of decades-old efforts to preserve segregation in Mississippi public schools still exist in today’s education system.</p>

<p>Congress passed the Mississippi’s Readmission Act in 1869, which established conditions for Mississippi to return to the United States after secession. The act stated “that the constitution of Mississippi shall never be so amended or changed as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens of the United States of the school rights and privileges secured by the constitution of said State.”</p>

<p>The lawsuit states that a new Mississippi constitution in 1890 and subsequent amendments to the constitution until 1987 violated that condition.</p>

<p>Southern Poverty Law Center senior attorney Will Bardwell discusses a lawsuit involving the Reconstruction Era on Dec. 12, 2017.</p>

<p>“We are not asking this judge to tell Mississippi how to come into compliance with this obligation,” said Southern Poverty Law Center senior staff attorney Will Bardwell at a coffee forum Thursday. “All we are asking for is a declaration that Mississippi is still obligated to provide the legal rights that Congress required it to maintain nearly 150 years ago.”</p>

<p>The state filed a motion to dismiss the suit in July, arguing that issue raised by the SPLC is political rather than legal, and violates the statute of limitations and the Eleventh Amendment, among other reasons.</p>

<p>The lawsuit stated that 13 of the state’s 19 F-rated school districts during the 2015-16 school year were more than 95 percent African American. All 19 had enrollments of at least 80 percent African American students.</p>

<p>On Friday, Bardwell stressed the suit was not about school funding, but the state’s duty to provide the same education to all students, regardless of geography, race, wealth or other factors.</p>

<p>“All we are asking federal court to do is to reaffirm that these are the obligations Mississippi owes to its schoolchildren,” Bardwell said. “If we are successful, the state will get the first chance to try to figure out how to come into compliance.”</p>

<p>Both parties are currently waiting on U.S. District Court Judge William H. Barbour to rule on the motion.</p>

<p>Auditor Stacey Pickering.</p>

<p>Eight of the largest state agencies lack an internal financial watchdog, Auditor Stacey Pickering said.</p>

<p>Pickering said legislation passed in 2003 requires agencies to establish internal auditing procedures but lawmakers have failed to provide funding to pay for it.</p>

<p>“If you’re going to identify internal waste, fraud, excess, poor management practices (and) efficiencies, it’s got to start with the internal audit program,” Pickering said.</p>

<p>Pickering ordered a review of 19 state agencies, not including community and four-year colleges, which found that 11 of those agencies either hired staff or outside consulting to conduct internal audits.</p>

<p>However, the agencies without auditors in place together control $14 billion of the state’s total $20 billion budget and oversee 18,000 employees, more than half the total.</p>

<p>The auditor’s office would still conducts periodic comprehensive audits as well as audits of federal funds.</p>

<p>Pickering said the Legislature should consider providing funding so that all agencies can comply with the auditing requirement and creating a centralized auditing agency under his direction or that of the Department of Financial Administration.</p>

<h2 id="classactionlawsuitaccusesjudgecorinthofrunningdebtorsprison">Class-action lawsuit accuses judge, Corinth of running ‘debtor’s prison’</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Alex Rozier</p>

<p id="date">date: 2017-12-05</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2017/12/06/class-action-lawsuit-accuses-judge-corinth-of-running-debtors-prison/ </p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center and the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law filed a federal class-action lawsuit Tuesday against the City of Corinth and a municipal court judge for operating what they call a “modern-day debtor’s prison”.</p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that Judge John C. Ross violated the constitutional rights of defendants facing misdemeanor or municipal charges by holding them in jail until they pay bail money or their fine, without taking into account their ability to pay.</p>

<p>“Even though debtors’ prisons have been outlawed in this country for more than 200 years, Corinth is running a jail from the Dark Ages in one of the nation’s poorest regions – it’s shameful,” said Sam Brooke, deputy legal director for the SPLC.</p>

<p>The Corinth Municipal Court did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Plaintiff Brian Keith Howell, a 28-year-old man whose leg was amputated following a car accident, was arrested on Nov. 27 for three minor traffic violations. On Dec. 4, Judge Ross assessed a $1,000 fine after Howell pleaded guilty to the traffic tickets and told Howell that he had to pay the amount in full or sit out the equivalent amount of the fine in jail – 50 days.</p>

<p>“Mr. Howell tried to tell the judge that he was working on getting disability and could not pay the fine right away, but Judge Ross wouldn’t listen,” Brooke said. “Judge Ross just told Mr. Howell his fine amount and sent him back to jail.”</p>

<p>Judge Ross makes no inquiry into the defendant’s ability to pay, and does not inform them of their right to counsel prior to jailing them for non-payment, SPLC said in a news release.</p>

<p>The SPLC and MacArthur Justice Center say they have been investigating the court’s practices over the last year. Over the course of the investigation, the groups encountered many indigent defendants who were either threatened with jail time or spent a considerable amount of time in jail for their inability to pay court-imposed fines and costs, according to the release.</p>

<p>Another plaintiff, Latonya James, an unemployed mother, appeared before Judge Ross on Aug. 14 for a school attendance violation charge involving her daughter who is struggling with bipolar disorder. In July, Judge Ross ordered James to pay $100 toward her fine, but when she informed Judge Ross that she could not make the payment, he gave her a notice to hand to the clerk’s office that read, “$100 today or jail.” She was not allowed to leave the clerk’s office, where she was threatened with jail, until her brother drove two hours to pay the $100.</p>

<p>“Despite being told repeatedly by the Mississippi Supreme Court and the Mississippi Judicial College to stop locking up Mississippians who are too poor to pay their fines in large lump sums and are not able to buy their way out of jail by paying a pre-determined amount of money bail, a disturbing number of judges in Mississippi defiantly refuse to comply with the law,” said Cliff Johnson, director of the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law.</p>

<p>“The MacArthur Justice Center and other civil rights organizations like the SPLC will keep filing lawsuits and judicial performance complaints until these judges, and the cities and counties that ratify and facilitate their practices, decide to abide by the law and the express instructions of Mississippi’s highest court,” he added.</p>

<h2 id="trumpbacklashofficialsboycottcivilrightsmuseumopening">Trump backlash: Officials boycott Civil Rights Museum opening</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Mississippi Today</p>

<p id="date">date: 2017-12-06</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2017/12/07/reps-thompson-lewis-withdraw-from-civil-rights-museum-opening-ceremony/ </p>

<p>Rogelio V. Solis, AP</p>

<p>A group portrait of the “Tougaloo Nine,” Tougaloo College students who participated in a “read-in” at the “white-only” Jackson Municipal Library in 1961, rests below their Jackson Police Department booking photographs in a display in the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum that opens Saturday.</p>

<p>Calling President Trump’s scheduled appearance Saturday at the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum an “insult,” U.S. Reps. Bennie G. Thompson, D-Bolton, and John Lewis, D-Ga., will not attend the opening ceremonies in Jackson.</p>

<p>“After careful consideration and conversations with church leaders, elected officials, civil right activists and many citizens of our congressional districts, we have decided not to attend or participate in the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum,” they said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>Lewis, arrested in Jackson in 1961 with Freedom Riders who were protesting segregated bus travel, was scheduled as a featured speaker at the opening ceremony. Lewis also was an organizer of Freedom Summer, a volunteer effort to register voters in Mississippi in 1964.</p>

<p>“President Trump’s attendance and his hurtful policies are an insult to the people portrayed in this civil rights museum. The struggles represented in this museum exemplify the truth of what really happened in Mississippi. President Trump’s disparaging comments about women, the disabled, immigrants and National Football League players disrespect the efforts of Fannie Lou Hamer, Aaron Henry, Medgar Evers, Robert Clark, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and countless others who have given their all for Mississippi to be a better place,” their statement continued.</p>

<p>“After President Trump departs, we encourage all Mississippians and Americans to visit this historic civil rights museum.”</p>

<p>Former Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus, who also served as secretary of the Navy under President Obama, also will not attend the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>“This institution and event should be a celebration of the hard-won progress in civil rights, but the main speaker, Donald Trump, is actively attacking that progress and turning us back to the dark days of hatred and division. An overt racist and a supporter of white supremacists and neo-Nazis, Donald Trump represents the exact opposite of what this museum is about — honoring the heroes who fought for, and often died for, the idea of equality of all,” Mabus said.</p>

<p>Trump, who was invited personally by Gov. Phil Bryant, is scheduled to share the stage Saturday with civil rights heroes, such as Myrlie Evers-Williams. Bryant, along with former Govs. William Winter and Haley Barbour, will also speak.</p>

<p>“We look forward to celebrating the opening of the Museum of Mississippi History and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. Though we will miss some who may not be with us on Saturday, they will be remembered also as we honor the many people whose stories are told in our two museums,” said Katie Blount, director of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.</p>

<p>White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was more direct in responding to the boycotts: “We think it’s unfortunate that these members of Congress wouldn’t join the president in honoring the incredible sacrifice civil rights leaders made to right the injustices in our history.</p>

<p>“The president hopes others will join him in recognizing that the movement was about removing barriers and unifying Americans of all backgrounds.”</p>

<p>The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.) countered the White House’s criticism of Lewis and Thompson: “It’s laughable that the White House is criticizing John Lewis and Bennie Thompson for not attending the opening of a civil rights museum that honors the sacrifice of … wait … John Lewis, Bennie Thompson, and many others.</p>

<p>“This White House is not serious about civil rights. From dismantling the civil rights division in the (Department of Justice) to equating peaceful people who protested racism to Neo-nazi’s and White Supremacists, they just don’t get it.”</p>

<p>The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum is the first state-sponsored civil rights museum in the United States.</p>

<p>Opening ceremonies for the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and Museum of Mississippi History will begin at at 11 a.m. Saturday on the grounds at 222 North St. in downtown Jackson. The openings are part of the state’s yearlong bicentennial celebration.</p>

<p>People planning protests on Saturday say Trump’s record on racial issues makes his presence offensive. Bryant, a staunch Trump supporter and frequent visitor to Washington to work with the Trump administration, says the president’s visit will help bring worldwide attention to the state and the museums.</p>

<p>“We are kinder and more tolerant here in Mississippi than I think perhaps other places,” Bryant said Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. “Allow the president to come and honor Mississippi with his speech and his presence.”</p>

<h2 id="200bicentennialstoriestoldinonemississippimile">200 bicentennial stories told in one ‘Mississippi Mile’</h2>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2017/12/08/200-bicentennial-stories-told-in-one-mississippi-mile/ </p>

<p>What exactly is the story of Mississippi’s 200 years? How is it told? And who gets to tell it?</p>

<p>The answers to these questions can be found on images or “photo stories” in storefront windows on Capitol Street in downtown Jackson. The pop-up, open air gallery, billed as the country’s largest, will be unveiled at 10:30 a.m. on Saturday at the King Edward Hotel, less than a mile from the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum opening the same day.</p>

<p>The “Mississippi Mile” will serve as the welcome party for the opening of “Celebrating Storytellers: a Bicentennial Gallery” produced by Blue Magnolia Films. The interactive exhibit, consisting of 200 five by five images, will be on display until Feb. 28. The welcome party also will feature an artists’ market, a beer garden and a “Passport to Mississippi” that will showcase the state’s cultural attractions and economic development.</p>

<p>“This is really about celebrating Mississippi,” said Chandler Griffin, co-founder of Blue Magnolia Films. “I think parties are great … but at 200 years, this is about celebrating our story, celebrating who we are, where we’ve been, where we are now and where we’re going in the future.”</p>

<p>Since 2005, in conjunction with the education organization Barefoot Workshops, Griffin and founder of Blue Magnolia Films Alison Fast have hosted workshops in Clarksdale catering to “outsiders” who travel to Mississippi to learn documentary filmmaking and documentary photography.</p>

<p>For the state’s bicentennial, the duo decided to offer a different kind of workshop. “Celebrating Storytellers,” is a statewide project commemorating the state’s 200-year history through photo stories created by residents across Mississippi. Once created, the photo stories are transformed into three-minute films highlighting the importance of cultural and economic revitalization.</p>

<p>Blue Magnolia Films founder Alison Fast works with Aaron Phillips, right, to record audio of Harry Ross at Port Gibson City Hall as part of “Celebrating Storytellers,” a statewide storytelling project.</p>

<p>“Instead of having primarily outsiders come to Mississippi and help tell our stories in a positive way, we wanted insiders,” Griffin said. “We wanted people from the communities — people who are not professional filmmakers or photographers telling Mississippi’s story and deciding how the story should be told.”</p>

<p>More than 100 Mississippians, ages 14 to 91, from 13 cities and towns participated in this project, including residents of Ocean Springs, Clarksdale, Greenville, Port Gibson, Laurel, Tupelo, Mound Bayou, Hattiesburg, Mississippi Band of Choctaw, Natchez, Oxford, Water Valley and Jackson. Each storyteller will have two to three images hanging in their towns in empty windows.</p>

<p>“We are proud to be a part of this bicentennial occasion, representing one of only 13 cities to celebrate positive leadership throughout the state, as well as to integrate the arts into public spaces,” said Greenville Mayor Errick D. Simmons.</p>

<p>Once he had the idea of putting all the images in one place, that place being Jackson, Griffin reached out to David Lewis, Greater Jackson Arts Council Project Specialist, who suggested Blue Magnolia Films produce a gallery consisting of 200 images, rather than Griffin’s original intended count of 100.</p>

<p>“The point was we wanted to celebrate the moment of all these stories being told, and the same time, we wanted to provide a way for everyone who hasn’t been able to get a ticket for the museums to have fun on Saturday and to come enjoy Jackson and celebrate Mississippi. So that’s how the mile got started,” said Lewis.</p>

<p>Along this mile, exhibit-goers will be introduced to a different kind of storytelling. Each image in the gallery is embedded with a QR code that can be scanned by viewers with their smartphones.</p>

<p>— Sereena Henderson (@SereenaHender) December 7, 2017</p>

<p>“Mississippi is the first to use this technology in a statewide initiative,” said Griffin. “It represents a critical shift in how we develop and tell our story going forward.</p>

<p>All 200 images appearing in the gallery were captured using nothing more than an iPhone.</p>

<p>“Just because you have an iPhone doesn’t mean you wake up in the morning and want to use it to tell a beautiful story,” said Blue Magnolia Films’ Alison Fast. “We encourage everyone to own the tools and put them in service of their life experience. We wanted to make these stories without neglecting the technology we have.”</p>

<p>Sereena Henderson, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Call them storytellers, innovators, dialogue creators, or simply Mississippians, 40 of them will be present at Saturday morning’s unveiling. They will do the honors of pulling back the white paper currently covering their images, revealing their personal narratives of the place they call home.</p>

<p>Blue Magnolia Films and Corner to Corner Productions will host a premiere screening of the “Celebrating Storytellers Bicentennial” documentaries 7-9 p.m. Friday at the Dr. Billy Kim International Center at Belhaven University.</p>

<p>Myrlie Evers, whose husband Medgar Evers was assassinated in the driveway of their home in 1963, received a standing ovation at the opening ceremony for the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and Museum of Mississippi History on Saturday in Jackson.</p>

<p>Medgar Evers was state field secretary of the NAACP, and Myrlie Evers continued the fight for civil rights after he was gunned down.</p>

<p>At the podium on Saturday, she reminisced about her first impression of the two museums, which she described as “separate but equal.”</p>

<p>But her attitude has changed since she toured the museums.</p>

<p>“I understand now … one is not complete without the other,” she said.</p>

<p>“I wept, because I felt the blows. I felt the bullets. I felt the tears. I felt the cries, but I also sensed the hope that dwelled in the hearts of all those people and children and it transferred into hope and love we find in the other building. Where does ‘separate’ come from? A word. Both buildings share the same heart, share the same beat.”</p>

<p>Myrlie Evers, center, and other dignitaries cut the ribbon to mark the opening of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and the Museum of Mississippi History Saturday in Jackson.</p>

<p>Getting to opening day has been a Herculean task for people who conceived, nurtured and assembled the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and Museum of Mississippi History — weathering last-minute controversy and a surprising snowfall at the finish line.</p>

<p>But Saturday, with temperatures near the freezing mark, thousands arrived to dedicate the new museums in downtown Jackson — civil rights activists who never thought they would see such a day, elected officials, everyday citizens and the president of the United States.</p>

<p>Utica Jubilee Singers perform a prelude to the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>Kendra Ablaza, Mississippi Todayu</p>

<p>President Donald Trump’s scheduled appearance, initiated by Gov. Phil Bryant, was the capstone for the saga of the museums’ opening. It was both applauded and condemned.</p>

<p>Trump arrived aboard Air Force One Saturday morning at Allen C. Thompson Field Air National Guard Base in Flowood and rode in a motorcade directly to the museums. Welcoming him were Bryant, U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker, U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper, Charles Evers, Vicksburg Mayor George Flaggs Jr. and Pascagoula Mayor Dane Maxwell, Trump’s Mississippi campaign director.</p>

<p>Trump toured the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and spoke to a private gathering of civil rights veterans, elected officials and museum patrons in the Two Museums Auditorium.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump, second from left, gets a tour of the newly opened Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>“These museums are labors of love,” Trump told the group. “This is a tribute to our nation at the highest level, and I salute you.”</p>

<p>The president also recognized the sacrifice of Medgar Evers.</p>

<p>“That is what he was, a hero,” Trump said.</p>

<p>Dr. Ben Carson, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, accompanied Trump to the museum.</p>

<p>No public remarks were planned.</p>

<p>The outdoor seating area in the plaza adjacent to the museums, with approximately 3,000 chairs, was more than halfway filled by 11:30 a.m. before the ceremonies kicked off. The Mississippi Girlchoir, Utica Jubilee Singers and Madison Central High Brass Quartet performed before speeches began.</p>

<p>Former Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Reuben Anderson welcomed the audience at the museums opening ceremony, which was the culmination of the state’s bicentennial celebration.</p>

<p>“I am proud of the stories that they celebrate and the experiences they share,” Anderson said. “These museums will be a place of civic discussion, learning and inspiration.”</p>

<p>Bryant told the crowd the museums will lead the state forward.</p>

<p>“From this anguish emerged a state with the most generous and hardworking people anywhere in the world,” he said. “This is indeed our bicentennial. Mississippi was once lost, now we are found; We were blind, now we see.”</p>

<p>Kayleigh Skinner, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Former Gov. William Winter also spoke: “These museums allow us to follow our state’s journey and inspire us to work harder to follow common dreams.”</p>

<p>“We must celebrate our differences, and we must embrace our common humanity, which binds us together.”</p>

<p>Days before Trump’s appearance, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Bolton, and former Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus declared they would skip the ceremony. Lewis and Thompson called Trump’s visit “an insult to people portrayed in this civil rights museum.”</p>

<p>Lewis, who was arrested in Jackson in 1961 with Freedom Riders protesting segregated bus travel and was an organizer of the Freedom Summer voter registration drive in Mississippi in 1964, was scheduled as a featured speaker at the opening ceremony.</p>

<p>After the ribbon cutting, the first members of the public entered the two museums. Six thousand tickets have been reserved for Saturday and Sunday.</p>

<p>Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves thanked families who donated pieces from the past to the museums so that Mississippians can be educated on the struggles and sacrifices made.</p>

<p>“Your actions allow us to tell our complete story,” Reeves said.</p>

<p>Speaker of the House Philip Gunn challenged Mississippians to go forth from the museums “with a spirit of renewed tolerance and understanding.”</p>

<p>Sen. Roger Wicker said the museums are an important step in understanding Mississippi’s proud and painful history. He said remembering Mississippi history is being mindful of things we wish did not happen and “acknowledging where we’ve been, what we’ve been through and what we have accomplished.”</p>

<p>“Let us concentrate on the future of Mississippi left to come,” Wicker said. “Let’s make this ceremony an opportunity to look ahead at next 200 years.”</p>

<p>Sue Barr, of Drew, considers the new museums “something special” for the state.</p>

<p>Aallyah Wright, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>“I think that it’s very good that (President Trump) accepted the invitation and was willing to recognize the museums and the work that has been done,” Barr said. “Of course, I hate all of the controversy. I wish that we could all go forward and be one.</p>

<p>Anthony Collier, a Clarksdale native, says this day is important to him because he grew up during Freedom Summer, but he is disappointed in elected officials who are boycotting the event.</p>

<p>“This is not about honoring (President) Trump'” he said. “We don’t have to agree on everything, and for them not to come, I’m very disappointed. I wouldn’t let Trump stop me from doing anything.</p>

<p>Aallyah Wright, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>“You can’t change the past. It’s time to start over and make Mississippi the best place it can be.”</p>

<p>Peyton Prospere, a Greenville native and Jackson resident, says the new museums “recognize what is one of the most extraordinary histories of any state in this country.”</p>

<p>“And I like the marriage of the Museum of Mississippi history with the Civil Rights Museum, and very much looking forward to hearing speakers who were in many cases participants in this history represented here.”</p>

<p>A few blocks from the museums plaza, protesters lined High Street chanting, “No hate in our state,” and holding signs that said, “Hate never made anything great.”</p>

<p>The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum focuses on ground zero of the African-American struggle for equal rights from 1945 to 1976.</p>

<p>It features 22,000 artifacts and re-created scenes such as the storefront of the Bryant Grocery that 14-year-old Emmett Till walked through before his encounter with a shopkeeper that led to his murder in the summer of 1955, as well as a classroom reproduction that shows the differences between schools for white students and those for African-American students during segregation.</p>

<p>The new center is the first state-sponsored civil rights museum in the country.</p>

<p>The Museum of Mississippi History examines life in Mississippi from 13,000 B.C. to the present day, starting with the First Peoples. The timeline also incorporates topics such as the clash between the Choctaw and Chickasaw nations and the early United States, the “Cotton Kingdom,” the first bottled Coca-Cola, the Great Depression’s impact on Mississippi and many others.</p>

<p>John Dittmer, professor emeritus of history at DePauw University, author and a nationally recognized authority on the civil rights movement, praised the Civil Rights Museum.</p>

<p>“I don’t know of any museum that hits racism so straightforwardly and so hard,” he said. “As you walk in you see the names of people that were lynched. This is not trying to cover anything up.”</p>

<p>After the fanfare, Reuben Anderson acknowledged that he has not toured the entire museum.</p>

<p>“I’d hate to say this but … I can’t go through it,” he said. “It’s difficult for me because it’s not history. I went through today with the president, and it’s unpleasant. I’ll get around to it with my grandchild. It’ll take a while.”</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2017/12/09/jackson-mayor-others-skip-opening-but-say-public-should-visit-civil-rights-museum/ </p>

<p>While crowds began to mill in front of the Museum of Mississippi History and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum on Saturday morning, a handful of the state’s political leaders — flanked by veterans of the civil rights movement and state legislators — held their own event about a mile away.</p>

<p>Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba and NAACP national president Derrick Johnson hosted a press conference at the Smith Robertson Museum in Jackson, deliberately skipping opening day festivities for the museums.</p>

<p>Rep. Bennie Thompson was scheduled to be at the conference but Johnson said the congressman’s plane had been delayed and that he wouldn’t be there.</p>

<p>The Jackson mayor told the audience that the museum tells a necessary and important story and the public should make an effort to visit it, but said he did not attend Saturday’s opening ceremony on principle.</p>

<p>“It can be said so goes Mississippi, so goes the rest of the world. We can see a change right here in the belly of the beast, we can see change take place across the world,” Lumumba told a crowded room of supporters.</p>

<p>“We don’t need Donald Trump to tell us what the civil rights movement means,” Lumumba said.</p>

<p>A day earlier, the group announced they would “respectfully and emphatically decline the invitation to participate” in the opening ceremony and share the stage with the president.</p>

<p>Civil rights activist Amos Brown gave an passionate speech Saturday at the Smith Robertson Museum, which was once a segregated school for black children that he attended as a child.</p>

<p>Civil Rights activist Amos Brown gives a passionate speech at the Smith Roberson Museum Dec. 9, 2017.</p>

<p>“Donald Trump did not show up to learn about civil rights,” Brown said.</p>

<p>As his speech became more and more impassioned, he clutched Johnson’s hand while telling the packed room that the president did not deserve to attend the museum opening. His speech was met with raucous applause and a standing ovation by those in the room.</p>

<p>While many who gathered a few blocks away for the opening of the two museums welcomed President Trump’s appearance, the crowd here clearly opposed the visit.</p>

<p>“We refuse to give a photo opportunity to an individual who seems to undermine the right of workers to be paid a fair wage,” Johnson said.</p>

<p>The NAACP president told the audience the work began by civil rights leaders is ongoing and that Trump will not “steal this wonderful thing that honors individuals who sacrificed,” adding that the president doesn’t care about our voting rights.</p>

<p>Sen. Sollie Norwood, D-Jackson, described himself as “a product of the movement” and said he and all black members of the Legislature are trying to visit the museum before the legislative session begins in January as a reminder of what we must fight for.</p>

<p>“Today was a grand opening, but there will be grander openings.”</p>

<p>Civil-rights movement veterans say they understood the historic nature of their activism might one day be the subject of museum — they just didn’t know when or where.</p>

<p>R.L. Nave, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Jerelean Funchess registered black voters and was arrested for protesting the city jail in Jackson. She hopes young people go to the museum and learn about the movement.</p>

<p>Jerelean Funchess helped register black voters in Jackson and was arrested outside the city jail for protesting the abuse of civil-rights activists, hundreds of whom were arrested and detained at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds, which the state’s new Civil Rights and History museums now overlook.</p>

<p>Despite the state’s role in those arrests, Funchess said she imagined a day when those activists would be recognized.</p>

<p>“I had faith that we would have a civil-rights museum, but I had no idea that it would be joined with the Mississippi history museum,” she said as she stood in line to enter the building.</p>

<p>“I think this is going to be extremely important for our youth, our students growing up, to give them some knowledge and wisdom of the truth of what happened in the ’60s and hopefully give them some hope towards a better future,” Funchess said.</p>

<p>George Smith said he became a guinea pig at the request of Medgar Evers, who asked Smith to attempt to register to vote. From there, he began attending mass meetings and working with his brother, pioneering physician Dr. Robert Smith, on health-care access for African Americans.</p>

<p>“I didn’t do a lot of marching but I did a lot of supporting so I’m just happy to see the museum here and be a catalyst for it,” said Smith, a retired Hinds County supervisor.</p>

<p>Hollis Watkins, an organizer with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s, said he frequently talked to museum organizers to make sure the exhibits were top quality.</p>

<p>Hollis Watkins, a former organizer in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee who worked with Vernon Dahmer and Bob Moses, also believed there would one day be a museum. Watkins initially preferred the museum to be located at Tougaloo College, his alma mater and a training ground during Freedom Summer.</p>

<p>“Looking at the photographs, mementos and the material as a whole I felt a fairly decent job had been done and could live with the road we were traveling so long as we didn’t get off that road,” Watkins said, adding that he wants to keep working with the museum to include more movement veterans.</p>

<p>Charlie Butts was a different kind of civil rights movement veteran. Butts was an editor and publisher of the Mississippi Free Press, which inspired the name of a local weekly newspaper in Jackson.</p>

<p>R.L. Nave, Mississippi Today</p>

<p>Charlie Butts (right), pictured here with his wife Alice, was the editor and publisher of the Mississippi Free Press, which Medgar Evers helped start. Butts said the presence of journalists helped provide some protection of activists during the 1960s.</p>

<p>The Free Press, which Medgar Evers helped start, stood in stark contrast to the Jackson Daily News and Clarion-Ledger, both of which supported the white Citizens Council. Butts, who lives in Cleveland, Ohio, said the presence of journalists helped protect activists.</p>

<p>“The thing about Medgar that people don’t remember is that he was here in the ’50s when he was almost by himself. There was no national press,” Butts said about Evers’ courage. “That (the presence of media) gave us some protection, but he had none. He was really alone.”</p>

<p>Rep. John Moore, R-Brandon</p>

<p>Rep. John Moore, R-Brandon, a 22-year veteran of the Mississippi House of Representatives, resigned late Friday following multiple allegations of sexual harassment.</p>

<p>House Speaker Philip Gunn confirmed the allegations to Mississippi Today first but could not state whether this led to Moore’s resignation. He did say that after hearing the allegations, his office consulted with outside counsel, which recommended an investigation and that the investigation was imminent.</p>

<p>Gunn said he met with Moore more than once and informed him of the allegations. Moore’s resignation from the House means an inquiry is no longer necessary, according to Gunn.</p>

<p>“We take any such allegations very seriously. We have followed protocol every step of the way and made sure that we have sought advice of counsel and followed that advice to the letter,” Gunn said Monday morning.</p>

<p>Once a House member resigns, the speaker’s office is technically unable to investigate any complaints about the member.</p>

<p>In the announcement Friday night, Moore said he was resigning because of health reasons. Moore underwent heart bypass surgery last year and missed part of the legislative session while recovering. When reached on Monday morning he said he had no knowledge of any sexual harassment allegations.</p>

<p>“Lord have mercy. Well, that’s interesting. I have no idea what he’s talking about. Maybe I ought to talk to the speaker,” Moore said.</p>

<p>Gunn declined to verify the number of women who made allegations or provide details of where and when the incidents occurred. But he said that maintaining the privacy of the women accusing Moore has been “preeminent” for him.</p>

<p>“We’re very sensitive to the privacy of the ones who’ve come forward,” Gunn said. “And I admire the courage of the women who came forward.”</p>

<p>Moore is the first Mississippi lawmaker in recent history to resign following accusations of sexual harassment, and Gunn said handling claims of sexual harassment is new territory for his office.</p>

<p>But nationally these types of accusations — and the ensuing resignation of public officials — are becoming part of the political landscape in Washington, D.C., and state capitals.</p>

<p>Last week, three members of the U.S. Congress resigned in three days. Each of the men — Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., and Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., had been dogged by accusations of sexual harassment.</p>

<p>In October, The New York Times published multiple allegations of sexual assault against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, leading to thousands of men and women publicly speaking out about their own experiences with sexual harassment. On social media, these stories have been labeled with the hashtag #metoo. Several of these allegations have centered on public figures and elected officials.</p>

<p>As a response to these allegations, in November, Rep. Jackie Speier, R-Calif., introduced legislation to the U.S. House that would overhaul the system for filing and settling harassment claims from congressional employees. The so-called #Metoo legislation follows numerous allegations against both public figures and elected officials that have been made public in recent months.</p>

<p>John Moore, the former chair of the House Education committee, also served on the House committees on Appropriations, Insurance, Judiciary B, Legislative Budget, Rules and Transportation. The sudden announcement of Moore’s resignation, late Friday afternoon, attributed his resignation solely to ongoing health concerns.</p>

<p>“Earlier this year I had a major health issue that caused me to rethink my ability to continue serving the people of Mississippi in this important position,” Moore in the release last week.</p>

<p>The 2018 legislative session begins Jan. 2. Gov. Phil Bryant will determine when a special election for House District 60 will be held, and Speaker Gunn will appoint a new chairman of the influential Education Committee.</p>

<h2 id="threenewlegislatorssworninmonday">Three new legislators sworn in Monday</h2>

<p>Reps. Kevin Ford (left) and Cheikh Taylor (center) took the oath of office on Monday, Dec. 11, to represent District 54 and District 38, respectively, in the Mississippi House.</p>

<p>Three new legislators took their oaths of office in ceremonies in the Senate and the House on Monday.</p>

<p>Cheikh Taylor, D-Starkville, and Kevin Ford, R-Vicksburg, joined the Mississippi House of Representatives in Districts 38 and 54, respectively. Neil Whaley, R-Potts Camp, joined the Senate, representing District 10.</p>

<p>Taylor replaces fellow Democrat, Tyrone Ellis, who retired after the 2017 legislative session. Ford will finish the term of Alex Monsour, who resigned after being elected Vicksburg alderman.</p>

<p>Whaley’s election in November flipped the seat of Democrat Bill Stone, who stepped down earlier this year to become manager of a local municipal utility.</p>

<p>Office of Lt. Gov. Reeves</p>

<p>“Proud to have Neil Whaley join the Senate representing District 10!,” Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves tweeted after Whaley’s swearing in Monday morning.</p>

<p>Speaker of the House Philip Gunn also tweeted congratulations to both Taylor and Ford.</p>

<p>“I’ve always been passionate about serving my community, so I’m excited to now be able to do that on a state level,” said Taylor, in a press release. “I look forward to working, on behalf of my district, with other members of the Mississippi Legislature.”</p>

<p>Taylor currently serves as executive director of the Brickfire Project, a nonprofit child-centered organization that includes a daycare and after-school programs. He has also served on various groups’ boards, including Habitat for Humanity, Oktibbeha County Board of Supervisors’ Advisory Council, Starkville Area Arts Council and Oktibbeha County Food Policy Council.</p>

<p>“I am honored that the people of District 54 have entrusted this position to me,” said Ford in that same press release. “I am excited about the opportunity to work with other state leaders to improve our state.”</p>

<p>Ford works at Ford Insurance Agency in Vicksburg, a business he established with his wife, Julie. The couple also owns a specialty coffee shop and bakery in town.</p>

<p>Whaley, a 29-year-old cattleman, is a small business owner from Potts Camp.</p>

<h2 id="statehasnostandardprocessforreportingsexualharassment">State has no standard process for reporting sexual harassment</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Adam Ganucheau</p>

<p id="date">date: 2017-12-11</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2017/12/12/no-statewide-standards-exist-for-sexual-harassment-reporting/ </p>

<p>When it comes to reporting sexual harassment, Mississippi has no standard process for making complaints, investigating claims or seeking redress for victims.</p>

<p>Mississippi Legislature</p>

<p>Rep. John Moore, R-Brandon</p>

<p>News that the resignation of 22-year veteran Rep. John Moore, R-Brandon, came after multiple complaints of sexual harassment shook the capital city on Monday, sparking questions about how harassment allegations in state government are handled.</p>

<p>Inside the Capitol, House leadership handles sexual harassment allegations differently than Senate leadership. Both those bodies handle harassment claims independently of the state personnel board, which oversees complaints from 129 state agencies and departments.</p>

<p>Allegations of harassment in both the House and Senate, according to written rules for both chambers, are ultimately handled by legislative leaders themselves – all of whom, currently, are men.</p>

<p>No sexual harassment complaint has been filed in the Senate since at least 2012, a spokeswoman for Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves said. No senator or current Senate staffer can recall or find evidence of a sexual harassment complaint ever being filed in the Senate.</p>

<p>Likewise, no “formal sexual harassment complaints” have been filed in the House since 2012, Speaker Philip Gunn said on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The policy in the House of Representatives explicitly prohibits “discrimination or harassment” by any person involved in the business of the House. The policy defines sexual harassment as remarks, threats, innuendos, gestures, physical contact, display, or circulation of written or electronic materials, pictures, or objects of a sexual nature.</p>

<p>The process by which complaints are filed in the House begins with a victim notifying a supervisor, the House clerk, or Speaker Pro Tempore verbally or in writing. The allegations “will be handled in a confidential manner to the extent possible,” according to the House rules.</p>

<p>If House leadership determines harassment or discrimination occurs, immediate corrective or disciplinary action is taken. If a state representative is found to violate the policy, the House Ethics committee determines how to discipline members. The House Management committee, specifically, disciplines employees.</p>

<p>Gil Ford Photography</p>

<p>Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton</p>

<p>Ethics chairman Rep. Andy Gipson, R-Braxton, told Mississippi Today that all members are required to take mandatory annual sexual harassment training. Gipson said the committee is only involved when an investigation is necessary.</p>

<p>Gunn in a Tuesday statement said the House “discrimination and harassment policy” was revised in 2013 under his leadership.</p>

<p>“We are additionally proactive when it comes to looking into potential sexual harassment which we pursue to the extent possible to determine if there exist any credible allegations,” Gunn said in a statement Tuesday.</p>

<p>In the Senate, any citizen, whether a legislative staffer or not, may file a complaint, although there is no written process by which complaints are considered as there is in the House.</p>

<p>Complaints in the Senate are handled by the Senate Rules committee, after being first filed to Secretary of the Senate Liz Welch or Sen. Terry Burton, chairman of the Rules committee.</p>

<p>The only passage written in the Senate rules that seemingly considers the complaint process reads: “The Rules Committee shall have jurisdiction over any questions concerning improper or unethical conduct by members of the Senate.”</p>

<p>“We’d deal with it as we go,” Burton said. “We might want to put together a subcommittee. I hate to get into what-ifs and conjecture because we just haven’t plowed that ground before. What I’m telling you is we might change up the procedure if someone were to file a complaint.”</p>

<p>The Legislature is not part of the state personnel board, which oversees 129 agencies. Those employees have a more defined process for filing complaints.</p>

<p>“Workplace harassment, including sexual harassment, is a disciplinary matter. The disciplinary offenses outlined for state employees specifically include an offense for creating a hostile work environment or participating in workplace harassment and clearly state that an agency may choose to reprimand, demote, suspend without pay, or terminate an employee for committing such an offense,” said personnel board spokeswoman Brittany Frederick in email.</p>

<p>Under the personnel board’s policy, harassment should be immediately reported to management. One option includes a formal process starting with the employee’s immediate supervisor and goes as high up the chain of command as needed.</p>

<p>If the harasser is in the chain of command, the victim can skip to the next person in the chain. If the employee is unsatisfied with the outcome, an appeal can be made to an appeals board. In the event the harasser is an agency director, the employer can skip the grievance process and go directly to the appeals board.</p>

<p>Frederick points to an executive order Gov. Phil Bryant signed in January 2017 that requires all employees to attend sexual harassment awareness and prevention training.</p>

<p>Lisa Ross, an attorney in Jackson who practices employment law said despite the absence of state statutes, victims can also enlist the help of federal courts.</p>

<p>Depending on whether the employer is private or government agency, victims of harassment can file a claim under Title VII, which prohibits certain kinds of discrimination in the workplace, or file a federal lawsuit on the grounds their constitutional rights were violated.</p>

<p>Under Title VII, victims have 180 days from date of the harassment or from the date of the adverse action on their claim of harassment. The law is also designed to protect people from retaliating if they file a claim. Ross said if an employer takes swift and immediate action to address a harassment claim that relieves them of liability, which leads many employers to initiate an investigation of a sexual harassment claim.</p>

<p>Ross said Mississippi should follow the lead of several states that have adopted statutes that mirror the federal Title VII laws, but give victims more time to report harassment.</p>

<p>“Lawmakers on High Street have never thought to protect women in the workplace by enacting a statute under Mississippi law,” Ross said. “We need some movement in the Legislature on that.”</p>

<h2 id="noindictmentsreturnedinandreacchiocase">No indictments returned in Andreacchio case</h2>

<p id="byline">by: Kate Royals</p>

<p id="date">date: 2017-12-04</p>

<p id="link">url: https://mississippitoday.org/2017/12/05/no-indictments-returned-in-andreacchio-case/ </p>

<p>(Left to right) Christian Andreacchio, age 20, and family member Shelton.</p>

<p>A Lauderdale County grand jury has chosen not to indict two individuals in the 2014 death of 21-year-old Christian Andreacchio.</p>

<p>Dylan Swearingen and Whitley Goodman, Andreacchio’s friend and girlfriend, were with Andreacchio the day he died. Andreacchio’s parents Rae and Todd maintain Goodman and Swearingen were involved in their son’s death and that he would not have killed himself.</p>

<p>Andreacchio’s death received national attention following a more than three-year investigation involving a host of police detectives, three police chiefs, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, private investigators, crime scene re-constructionists, a forensic pathologist, several attorneys and finally the Attorney General’s office.</p>

<p>The death was prematurely ruled a suicide by then-Meridian police chief and the case then reopened months later by current chief Benny Dubose.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, however, District Attorney Bilbo Mitchell asked that his office be recused from the case because he coached Andreacchio in soccer when he was younger.</p>

<p>The state Attorney General’s office presented the case to the grand jury last month.</p>

<p>“Our involvement is now over after the grand jury did not find sufficient evidence to indict anyone for the death,” spokeswoman Margaret Ann Morgan said.</p>

<p>A call to J. Stewart Parrish, attorney for Swearingen and Goodman, was not immediately returned on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Rae Andreacchio, Christian’s mother, said she was not surprised by the outcome but questioned how the Attorney General’s office handled the case. She said to her knowledge, no one ever contacted the expert witnesses the family had hired to investigate the forensic evidence and other information regarding the case. She also said no one who worked on a Mississippi River tow boat with Christian and had knowledge of the events leading up to his death was contacted.</p>

<p>“It’s all based on what information they give to the grand jury. So when you give no contradicting information because you haven’t spoken to anyone that would contradict anything, then of course it’s going to be a suicide,” she said. “We were kind of prepared for it.”</p>

<p>Morgan said, however, the grand jury received information that “encompassed investigations by multiple agencies, including our office, the family’s investigator, MBI (Mississippi Bureau of Investigation), and Meridian PD (Police Department).”</p>

<p>The family decided not to pursue a civil suit filed earlier this year against Goodman and Swearingen, but Andreacchio said she and family members will continue to search for answers.</p>

<p>“We’ll just continue to try to find someone who will help us,” she said.</p>
